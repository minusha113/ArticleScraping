Draper, who holds around 30,000 BTC according to reports, told Musk that he would like to pay for the Tesla cybertruck with BTC while promoting his Bitcoin payment processor portfolio company OpenNode. He said:

“Hi Elon Musk, I would like to buy a Tesla cybertruck. Although I personally would rather keep my own #bitcoin, you can accept #bitcoin through our Draper VC company OpenNode.”

Why now?

On Jan. 29, Bitcoin proceeded to rally by 14% in merely 30 minutes shortly after Elon Musk's Bitcoin support began circulating on social media.

Many speculated that Musk could have been the high-net-worth investor behind the massive Bitcoin accumulation on Coinbase in the past week.

In the past several days, the premium on Coinbase skyrocketed to around $200, compared to Binance. This usually indicates significant buying activity from U.S. investors.

However, Musk did not follow up on the bio change, and overnight, the rally reversed. Bitcoin rose from $33,000 to over $38,000, and dropped back down to $33,000.

Draper likely tweeted at Musk due the interest in Bitcoin from Musk and the positive market sentiment around BTC.

In a recent interview with CNBC, Draper said that he is actually buying more Bitcoin. Draper also said that he does not intend to sell BTC in the future, expressing his strong belief in Bitcoin as a “currency of the future.” He said:

""I'm actually just buying more [Bitcoin]... I have no interest in ever selling my #Bitcoin for dollars. Why would I take the currency of the future and sell it for the currency of the past?""

On-chain data shows that Draper isn't the only one focused on long term gains. In fact, ""HODLing"" activity, which indicates the intent of Bitcoin investors to hold BTC for a long time, is at record highs.

Will Bitcoin ever be used as a currency?

Bitcoin is increasingly becoming considered as a store of value and an alternative to gold as a safe-haven asset. In recent months, though, the correlation and inverse correlation between Bitcoin, gold and stocks have been decreasing.

In addition to the massive price gains, the fear of inflation and the large injection of liquidity by central banks have stirred massive interest among institutional and high-net-worth investors.

But while accepting BTC is becoming increasingly common, the question remains whether Bitcoin would ever be used as a currency and a medium of exchange like the dollar today.

Ironically, when the price of Bitcoin is in a clear uptrend, investors are less likely to sell or spend their BTC. Draper himself is suggesting that he will probably pay the $40,000 for the Cybertruck with dollars rather than the ""currency of the future.""

However, if Bitcoin price stabilizes in the future at a high enough price level and sees lower volatility, then BTC could become more compelling for everyday payments.

Meanwhile, as the network gains more users and must scale, the Bitcoin blockchain network may ultimately become inefficient to use for everyday payments on the first layer.

At that point, second-layer scaling solutions, like Lightning Network and sidechains like Liquid, for example, may become the blockchain ""apps"" for processing small payments instantly. Such interoperable platforms will likely have their own tradeoffs with varying degrees of trustlessness, privacy and decentralization.","['elon', 'network', 'sell', 'tim', 'id', 'draper', 'buy', 'future', 'bitcoin', 'cybertruck', 'price', 'btc', 'musk', 'currency', 'tesla']","Tim Draper, the billionaire Bitcoin (BTC) investor who also invested early in Tesla, reacted to the company's CEO and world's richest man, Elon Musk, adding #Bitcoin to his Twitter bio to join the likes of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.

Government and regulations

On Nov. 4, after much insistence from the Spanish fintech sector, the senate’s Committee on Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation definitively approved a law for The Digital Transformation of the Financial Sector which included the creation of a sandbox.

The Spanish Association of Fintech and Insurtech highlighted the importance of the sandbox: “Its immediate implementation will allow the generation of new initiatives in the Fintech ecosystem, facilitate access to financing, promote greater competition and reduce entry barriers.”

Ismael Santiago, professor at the University of Seville and CEO of OlivaChain I+D+I believes that these regulatory developments will favor “the creation of new value-added jobs, technological development and economic competitiveness.”

“Since its appearance in the crypto scene of our country, the doors of many international companies have been opened to the potential of the crypto world; being a very important step, in order to allow a greater arrival of crypto actives to the general public. There is still a long way to go, but of course, with the foundations established in 2020 with all these milestones, it is tremendously promising for the sector,” commented Álvaro Alcañiz, chief marketing officer and co-founder of Onyze, which offers custody and infrastructure services for digital assets.

Raúl López, country manager of Spain at Coinmotion argued:

“If this sandbox is carried out, it could make Spain a reference point in Europe, which could attract high investment in the sector, which would be a great stimulus for the crypto ecosystem and would also help to retain and attract national and international talent.”

However, as Spain is part of the European Union, it is also important to bear in mind that a proposal for regulation from the European Commission, related to crypto markets, has been made public. This is how the acronym MiCA came to be known, which refers to markets in crypto assets. Another important document is the Fifth EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive.

Crypto adoption and a hack

The adoption of cryptocurrencies in Spain has continued to grow in 2020. Besides, as far as Bitcoin ATMs are concerned, Spain ranks in the top 10 countries with the most units in the world, with a total of 119 at the time of writing.

Raúl López, country manager of Spain at Coinmotion, also offered his perspective: “The year 2020 will undoubtedly be remembered mainly for the appearance of COVID-19, which affected all sectors and industries worldwide. The stock markets collapsed, and market mechanisms did not work properly because even the traditional gold value refuge suffered a sharp fall. It is possible that investors were looking for liquidity, and the collapse in traditional markets may have forced crypto investors to liquidate high-risk investments to compensate for losses elsewhere or just to have liquidity in euros.”

He gave an example of his company to illustrate the increase in the total volume of operations: in February it increased by +53%, in March, the same trend was maintained, with an increase of +27% with respect to the previous month, where 65% came from purchase operations. “And in the following months, for example, in April, the volume reached in March was almost multiplied by four. And the same happened in May with respect to the volume achieved in April,” he remarked.

Another story that impacted the Spanish crypto world this year was the attack on the 2gether platform at the end of July. On Aug. 31, Cointelegraph en Español reported that the hack had resulted in the theft of a significant amount of Bitcoin and Ether (ETH). It should be noted that, after the attack, the company took a number of measures to overcome this situation and to compensate the users who were affected. In an interview, Ramón Ferraz, CEO of 2gether, explained in further detail.

Increase of crypto culture

Jorge Soriano, co-founder of a crypto platform Criptan, preferred not to highlight any Spanish development in particular, and considered that it does not have to happen either because “the crypto world is designed to be something global,” continuing:

“Its objective is precisely that in this ecosystem there are no borders or barriers throughout the world. What we can observe in Spain is that the consequences of what happened on a global level have been experienced. And in this sense, we have seen that in 2020, adoption has grown a lot. The number of users, purchases and sales has been increasing at a very high rate.”

He also said that a certain crypto culture has been increasing: “We are checking how users have more and more exposure to cryptomarkets. From our experience in Criptan, we have observed that users, instead of trading, buy crypto to sell and take out in euros. What they want is to be with part of their capital in Bitcoin.”

Álex Fernández, CEO of BitBase, highlighted the significant concern raised by many people who want to be informed and understand all the disruptive changes that are coming in relation to Bitcoin and blockchain. “We have established a closer relationship with the people, and many of them come to our points of sale to be advised on the matter. They inform us that the economic uncertainty we are going through has generated a lot of distrust with the politicians who lead and manage our country, as well as with the financial institutions, which have largely caused the economic situation we are currently experiencing, and which is unsustainable,” he said.

“They see in Bitcoin and blockchain an alternative when they know it gives them security and confidence.”

According to Ramón Ferraz, the rise of the BTC “shows the reality of a new currency based on the new decentralized economy, a refuge of value that is increasingly attractive to society.”

In a Sept. 21 interview to Cointelegraph en Español, Mariana Gospodinova, general manager of Crypto.com’s European division, stated that in Spain, the interest in cryptocurrencies has grown significantly.

Pandemic changes the narrative

Javier Pastor Moreno, sales director at Bit2Me, crypto services provider, put the focus on the pandemic, saying it “has changed everything.” He went on to say:

“The need to have a more modern, open and free monetary system, while sheltering from the massive fiat money printing by central banks, has caused the adoption to accelerate and put Bitcoin and crypto on the map. We are in the early stages of a process that will probably last a few years, but undoubtedly, the catalyst by luck or misfortune has been this crisis.”

Antonio Sánchez, CEO of Inforbyt and Cardano’s ambassador to Spain, commented: “We have seen a considerable increase in people asking the big question of: ‘What is Bitcoin, and what is it for?’ We are living in a historic moment: We are going through a global pandemic in which banks and big companies are reeling as Bitcoin goes up without a break.”

“The crypto market has been growing considerably in recent days, and adoption is taking place much more, perhaps out of fear of what might happen to fiat money, or perhaps out of boredom of seeing all the banks start charging even for holding large sums of money.”

DeFi boom

The DeFi phenomenon was also present in Spain. Various activities were carried out, such as talks and virtual events, as well as some hackathons. The movement of decentralized finance, as it did on a global level, also aroused interest in the Iberian territory.

Juan Pablo Mejía, trainer and content disseminator, also known as “John in Crypto,” shared:

“Besides the big rise in the price of Bitcoin, I think the explosion of DeFi protocols has been the most important thing in the crypto ecosystem in 2020.”

Along the same lines, Guillermo Abellán Berenguer, co-founder of DeFi Lab, shared his point of view, saying: “It has become very clear that smart finance contracts allow interaction with services and products that, until now, needed a trusted intermediary. Currently, borrowing, lending, managing an investment fund or providing liquidity in decentralized exchanges, among many others, is possible without trusted intermediaries.” In an interview to Cointelegaph en Español, DeFi Lab explained how it is working on boosting decentralized finance in the Spanish-speaking world.

It was Josh Goodbody, director of growth institutional business for Latin America and Europe at Binance, who managed to concisely summarize the past year:

On Jan. 29, Ripple Labs filed its response to the SEC's complaint. Ripple, as it has many times before, argued that XRP is not a security i.e. an investment in Ripple and is therefore not in the SEC's jurisdiction. Ripple is, moreover, prepared to drag the rest of the industry into its fight to make its case.

A Ripple representative told Cointelegraph:

""The SEC has clearly picked two winners and ignored a growing and robust industry that is much larger than Bitcoin and Ether. In addition to discovery we will seek directly in the lawsuit, we filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for more information about how the SEC determined the status of Ether as a non-security.""

The FOIA request in question, which is available here, brings into question Ether's status. Representatives at the SEC have repeated many times that, while its presale may have been a securities offering at the time, Ether is sufficiently decentralized that it qualifies as a commodity and thus, Ether trading in the U.S. is under the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

The FOIA request specifically asks for ""All communications with the Ethereum Foundation and/or other relevant companies (including, but not limited to, ConsenSys) or individuals in the ether ecosystem (including but not limited to, Vitalik Buterin, Anthony Di Iorio, Charles Hoskinson, Mihai Alisie, Amir Chetrit, Joseph Lubin, Gavin Wood and Jeffrey Wilcke), or any attorneys or other individuals representing the Ethereum Foundation or other relevant companies or individuals in the ether ecosystem, and all documents, including internal communications, analyses, and other materials, that were prepared or relied upon by Director Hinman, or any other current or former Division Director, Staff, or Commissioner in reaching the determination that ether is not a security, including drafts of Director Hinman's statements regarding ether and analyses prepared by SEC staff.""

The request is likely to entail a huge volume of records from several years of commission documents, given how long it took the commission to come forward with any statements at all.

The question of timing is critical in the Ether as security or commodity discussion. The Ether presale happened years before the SEC issued its DAO Report. A response to the meltdown of Ether investment into the Decentralized Autonomous Organization, the DAO Report was the SEC's 2017 declaration that some cryptocurrencies were securities.

The subsequent years have seen enormous confusion as to what qualifies an initial coin offering as a security or not. Important to note is that Bitcoin, never having had a presale, never comes up in these conversations. The SEC has, nevertheless, never pursued Ether. But in December, the commission filed against Ripple in a landmark case that alleges that Ripple Labs' sale of XRP constitutes an ongoing sale of investment contracts in the firm.

In its FOIA request, Ripple leans especially heavily on the claim that Bitcoin and Ether are both controlled by China-based mining pools, playing off of longstanding fears by U.S. regulators of Chinese control of digital assets. Ripple further asks for communications between the commission, particularly Division of Corporation Finance Director Bill Hinman, and key figures and attorneys for the Ethereum Foundation. While it is almost inconceivable that the SEC will back out of its many statements that Ether is a commodity at this stage in the game, Ripple's aim seems to be to undercut the legitimacy of that decision in an effort to shore up its own defense.

The SEC's case against Ripple has been coming for a long time, and Ripple has expended significant resources in trying to stave it off. While XRP also predates the DAO Report, the key argument is that Ripple continues to control the bulk of the XRP market in a way that, for example, the Ethereum Foundation, Vitalik Buterin, and Joe Lubin do not.

Since the SEC's announcement, the price of XRP has collapsed and many U.S. exchanges have delisted the token.","['commission', 'ether', 'xrp', 'know', 'gets', 'demands', 'secs', 'request', 'including', 'desperate', 'defense', 'security', 'foundation', 'isnt', 'sec', 'ripple']","Ripple's case before the Securities and Exchange Commission is threatening to have major, well, ripple effects for the industry.

At least in so many words. The Securities and Exchange Commission made a joint statement on Friday expressing concern over the ""extreme price volatility of certain stocks’ trading prices over the past several days.""

Though the commission didn't use the words ""GameStop,"" ""Robinhood,"" or ""Reddit,"" it's obvious that what the commission is talking about is the recent chaos surrounding the three. It's already attracted major regulatory pressure. The SEC did, however, specify:

""The Commission will closely review actions taken by regulated entities that may disadvantage investors or otherwise unduly inhibit their ability to trade certain securities.""

Robinhood, already the subject of enormous backlash from its users, is clearly in the sights of this announcement, as it is the ""regulated entity"" i.e. broker-dealer at the heart of the news. It is not unprecedented for Robinhood to shut down trading on GME and other stocks, but the firm's shutting off of sales but not buys provoked mass ire from investors and casual observers.

At the same time, many point to r/WallStreetBets, the Reddit group united in buying and holding Gamestop, as an example of classic market manipulation or other securities law violations in a new media venue. Marc Powers, formerly of the SEC’s enforcement office and currently an adjunct professor on blockchain regulation at Florida International University, defended this view, but put forward alternatives to classic enforcement:

“Another way of approaching this issue, rather than going after individuals, is to issue a 21(a) report as a way of providing guidance to the marketplace and these generally newer investors as to the SEC’s view on market manipulation and other laws that may have been applicable to the situation, similar to what the SEC did with the issuance of the DAO report involving ICO in July 2017.”

Powers was referring to the SEC's initial entry into initial coin offerings, which refrained from enforcement at the time but did result in a mass clampdown on subsequent ICOs.

But, maybe it's a result of a House, Senate and Presidency suddenly under Democratic rule and eager to roll back the pro-Wall Street legacy of the past four years, but very few at the federal level are seriously talking about doing anything about the redditors.","['commission', 'secs', 'view', 'gamestop', 'securities', 'looking', 'talking', 'way', 'robinhoods', 'robinhood', 'handling', 'sec', 'investors', 'trading', 'words']","The U.S. securities watchdog is looking into the affair of Robinhood and the Redditors.

The question is a difficult one to answer, but the actions of a number of major institutions and the sentiments of some well-renowned investment managers suggest that Bitcoin (BTC) is becoming more attractive as a hedge against these fears.

Business analytics firm MicroStrategy has led the institutional charge into Bitcoin over the past six months, having purchased more than $1 billion worth of BTC after adopting the cryptocurrency as its primary treasury reserve asset. The company now holds approximately 70,784 BTC.

MicroStrategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor, has been abundantly clear in his assertion that the preeminent cryptocurrency is a superior store of value over fiat money, and he’s put his Bitcoin where his mouth is since August 2020.

Meanwhile, Grayscale Investments has been vacuuming up Bitcoin in recent months and has firmly established itself as the largest digital asset manager in the world. Grayscale’s Bitcoin holdings are a significant contributor to its overall portfolio, with its roughly 648,000 BTC valued at over $20 billion, according to the latest data from the firm.

Following in the footsteps of these proverbial Bitcoin trailblazers, SkyBridge Capital launched its own Bitcoin fund in December 2020. Skybridge was founded by American financier and former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci, who has delivered some very bullish statements about Bitcoin’s future as a safe-haven asset.

Scaramucci and SkyBridge executive Brett Messing penned an op-ed published by CNN that portrays BTC as an increasingly attractive option for long-term investors looking for shelter from inflation. The pair said that increased regulation, improved infrastructure and financial institutions offering exposure to cryptocurrencies have “made bitcoin investments as safe as owning bonds and commodities like gold, which are also used to balance portfolios.”

Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency space have been thrust into mainstream consciousness once again as BTC, Ether (ETH) and other altcoins have hit all-time highs over the past two months. What remains to be seen is if Bitcoin will indeed become less volatile and live up to the hopes of Scaramucci, Saylor and others who see the cryptocurrency becoming a new-age safe-haven asset.

Changing perceptions

There has been an overarching sentiment that the current cryptocurrency boom is inherently different from previous periods of considerable growth. Driven by a force of institutional interest, cryptocurrencies are seemingly becoming a more reputable investment for individuals and institutions alike.

Pavel Matveev, CEO of cryptocurrency payments firm Wirex, told Cointelegraph that the perception of Bitcoin may well be changing despite the fact that it still retains its notoriety for extreme price volatility.

Matveev said that the price of Bitcoin is still three times more volatile than the S&P 500 index, while more recent haywire movements in value have been driven by macroeconomic factors like the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting fiscal measures by governments to address the situation:

“The most volatile drivers of the BTC price have been its limited supply and its booming demand from institution-grade investors. That being said, the QE measures and the low to negative rates environment did increase liquidity to historical levels. Naturally, the choice for a company to allocate a small portion of treasury funds in a rallying Bitcoin when the value of the Greenback is collapsing is natural.”

A pertinent question for many is whether Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Ether are now becoming more trustworthy, long-term investments amid continued economic uncertainty. Matveev noted that institutions, which are typically long-term holders, will have made informed decisions when looking to invest in BTC.

Bitcoin’s positive track record for long-term appreciation has been a driver of interest from institutions, and Matveev also noted that some publicly listed payments companies have committed to integrating Bitcoin into their core activities, which adds further credence to the performance of BTC’s price. However, he conceded that this “doesn’t change Bitcoin’s high market volatility in the short-term” but at least makes it an eligible investment.

Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com — an exchange and crypto card issuer — noted to Cointelegraph the impact that institutional investment is having on the cryptocurrency markets and suggested that their continued involvement could bring balance to the space: “Investing in Bitcoin today is different than it was in 2017, when it was primarily retail-led and thus prone to more dramatic market movements.” He added:

“Today we are seeing large investors like Michael Saylor at MicroStrategy who have taken large Bitcoin positions with a long-term thesis based approach. A large part of their thesis is that BTC is not only a hedge against inflation, but a better hedge than gold. Their size and thesis may bring more long-term stability to the Bitcoin market.”

Marszalek also highlighted the fact that some renowned traditional financial asset management firms like Fidelity and JPMorgan Chase have started to advocate for clients to have a 2% to 5% exposure to cryptocurrency in their portfolios. He believes it’s evidence that the tide is shifting: “There’s no doubt that perception of BTC has turned a corner. As a result BTC is safer than it used to be as a long-term hedge, but still carries risk like any other investment.”

Regulation plays a role

As interest in the space continues unabated, questions around regulation are still a prominent point of discussion in the potential long-term adoption and appreciation of cryptocurrencies. Wirex’s Matveev agreed that regulation could well have an influence on cryptocurrencies being considered conventional, long-term investments in the next few years, adding further:

“Like with all investments, there’s an element of risk so it wouldn’t be right to say that any investment is 100% safe as the markets are constantly changing, but I think public opinion is beginning to sway towards seeing crypto as a great alternative to regular payments.”

Renowned hedge fund manager Ray Dalio also waded into the Bitcoin conversation at the end of January in a personal post on LinkedIn. Dalio is well-known as a proponent for Gold as a long-term investment and store of value. In his essay which he penned in an effort to avoid ‘media misinterpretation’, Dalio described a number of reasons why he believes Bitcoin has become an “alternative gold-like asset”. At the same time, Dalio believes that the limited supply of Bitcoin is a point of contention, as other cryptocurrencies that fulfil a similar role could negate its finite supply.

While he noted the apparent success of Bitcoin as a new invention in the decade since its inception, Dalio also highlighted the fact that governments and banks will not simply let a competitive system upset their control on the global economy especially when it comes to the ‘privacy’ that Bitcoin affords users:

“It is hard for me to imagine that they would allow Bitcoin (or gold) to be an obviously better choice than the money and credit that they are producing. I suspect that Bitcoin’s biggest risk is being successful, because if it’s successful, the government will try to kill it and they have a lot of power to succeed.”

With his firm operating across multiple jurisdictions, Marszalek has direct experience working with regulators, and he highlighted its base in Malta as a prime example of the potential benefits of clear, fair regulatory parameters: “2020 was a year where regulation for cryptocurrencies advanced quite a lot. [...] Malta is one of the few jurisdictions in the EU that have developed a clear digital assets regulatory framework to protect investors.”

While the outlook for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrencies markets is in a very positive space, there are still prevailing risks associated with investing in the space. The cryptocurrency market is still in its infancy and, as highlighted above, some areas still need to be addressed before Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies would truly become tried and trusted long-term investments.","['institutions', 'investments', 'play', 'cryptocurrencies', 'investment', 'longterm', 'hedge', 'risk', 'safe', 'bitcoin', 'space', 'btc', 'cryptocurrency', 'matured']","Following in the footsteps of these proverbial Bitcoin trailblazers, SkyBridge Capital launched its own Bitcoin fund in December 2020.
Driven by a force of institutional interest, cryptocurrencies are seemingly becoming a more reputable investment for individuals and institutions alike.
Matveev noted that institutions, which are typically long-term holders, will have made informed decisions when looking to invest in BTC.
A large part of their thesis is that BTC is not only a hedge against inflation, but a better hedge than gold.
Dalio is well-known as a proponent for Gold as a long-term investment and store of value."

However, all the attention of the whales, as well as all the attention of the public, was fixed on Bitcoin (BTC). Today, we will look at why Ether (ETH) is a more attractive asset and why this cryptocurrency should become the “first cryptocurrency” for every investor.

Let's start with the numbers: ETH’s growth since its March 2020 low after the coronavirus-induced market crash has been 1,200%, whereas BTC has only grown around 700%. ETH’s growth since its March 2020 low after the coronavirus-induced market crash has been 1,200%, whereas BTC has only grown around 700%. Of course, against the backdrop of record highs for Bitcoin, whose price reached $ 40,000, the rise of Ether to $1,400 does not seem so impressive. Moreover, the market capitalization of ETH is five times less than the volume of the BTC market. But what is more important for an investor: nice numbers and records of an asset from a portfolio or high income?

There are very strong reasons to believe that Ether will continue to rise in price in 2021 and bring more profit to investors than the “most famous cryptocurrency,” Bitcoin.

Demand among developers

Ethereum is the number-one platform for building blockchain projects and launching decentralized applications. The chart below displays the number of unique ERC-20 tokens traded during the first years since the launch of the Ethereum network. And despite the fact that the rate of expansion of the market for blockchain startups has slowed down since the initial coin offering bubble burst in 2018, their total number is still growing.

And even despite the fact that Ethereum has serious competitors — such as Tron, Polkadot, Cardano, Cosmos and Tezos — Vitalik Buterin's cryptocurrency platform continues to be a leader in this direction.

Growing transaction volume

During 2020, more than $1 trillion worth of transactions were recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. These figures exceed the transaction volume of payments giants like PayPal, which is used by over 350 million users and has with average volumes that do not generally exceed $200 billion per quarter.

Also, keep in mind that each transaction generates network fees paid in ETH. And since the network's growth rates are still high, we can confidently expect the continuation of the “bullish” trend of ETH. In any case, interest in cryptocurrency is increasing, as is the number of active wallets, the number of transactions on the network and the average transaction size.

Development of the DeFi sector

Despite Bitcoin's leadership in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum remains the leader of the young decentralized finance industry. Highly popular in the summer of 2020, DeFi lending and staking projects continue to grow, attracting new investments.

Related: Was 2020 a ‘DeFi year,’ and what is expected from the sector in 2021? Experts answer

The total value locked in decentralized finance since the beginning of 2020 has grown nearly 3,300%, from $687 million to $23.2 billion. And it is Ethereum that is the main platform for the creation and launch of most new DeFi projects and stablecoins.

The emission of stablecoins is constantly growing, as digital assets backed by the value of less-volatile fiat currencies are a very convenient tool for quick settlements between users, for forming trading pairs on crypto exchanges and for saving capital from high volatility in your crypto wallet.

Separately, we should talk about the interest of institutional investors in decentralized finance. While the chaos in the DeFi market nearly eroded institutional confidence in the potential of blockchain in the financial sector in the summer of 2020, public companies continue to show interest in the new asset type.

In August 2020, Archax and Algorand revealed plans to develop tools for introducing DeFi among institutions. And in the fall of 2020, it became known that xSigma, a subsidiary of the Nasdaq-traded ZK International, is working on the development of DeFi services and is preparing to launch a decentralized exchange for trading stablecoins.

We all remember what big investors' attention to Bitcoin led to last year, right? Now, it looks like other areas of the cryptocurrency industry are in for the same, and some of them are directly related to Ethereum. And the main advantage of Ethereum lies in the versatility of its technology and its growing community.

CryptoPunks are widely considered to be the original NFT project, released even before Cryptokitties, the blockchain-based collectibles project that propelled NFTs to mainstream consciousness. CryptoPunks developers Larva Labs report that Punks have accounted for $26 million in lifetime sales on their native marketplace, and the average sale price for Punks over the past year has been $6,199.

Each Punk has unique attributes, such as background color, accessories, and even some ultra-rare features, such as an “alien” or “zombie” appearance. The Punk that sold today, #2890, is one of nine alien Punks in existence.

The bidding for the Punk was competitive throughout the last week, with DeFi megawallet-turn-Twitter personality 0x_b1 putting in a 500 ETH bid. The Punk was last sold in July of 2017 for 8 ETH, meaning the owner made a 75x return on their investment.

The new owners are a group of investors that include FlamingoDAO, a “NFT collective that supports and collects premium NFTS,” according to a Flamingo spokesperson. The official FlamingoDAO Twitter handle confirmed the purchase with a meme:

“It's simple: Cryptopunks is a groundbreaking project; it pre-dated the ERC 721 standard and crypto kitties,” said the spokesperson on the investment thesis. “Aliens are the rarest form of Cryptopunk and we believe that the acquired Alien will be prized by collectors over time and mature into an iconic digital art piece.”

Crypto art collector @gmoneyNFT, who himself dropped 140 ETH on a Punk earlier in the month, thinks that the alien is a fine investment despite the sky-high valuation.

“I think it was a great purchase. As the world moves more digital, the digital ""flex"" will be more and more important. It's how humans operate in the physical world. It won't change in the digital realm,” he said.

Long-derided as a secondary usecase for blockchain, sales like today’s demonstrate that NFTs are just beginning to have their day in the sun. NBA Topshot, a collectible highlight project from Dapper Labs, has proven to be tremendously popular, and Axie Infinity’s native critters have been selling for remarkable prices as of late as well.

Some critics have called into the question the sky-high prices rare NFTs have been fetching, however, arguing that simple digital scarcity is a shaky foundation on which to justify a $750,000 sale. @gmoneyNFT dismisses these criticisms, saying that there are plenty of real-world analogues that make just as much — or as little — sense.

“Why would someone pay millions of dollars for an original Andy Warhol screen print when you can buy the same one online for $20? Why would someone buy a pair of yeezy's for $300 when you can buy a fake from the same factory, made with the same materials for much less? Humans like to feel special.

DOGE to $1?

Data from Cointelegraph Markets, CoinMarketCap and Tradingview showed a transformation taking place in the DOGE ecosystem overnight on Jan. 27, with DOGE/USD hitting $0.0138.

In a matter of hours on Thursday, the pair added over 80% to its spot price before correcting, still holding 1 cent support at the time of writing.

The gains accompanied a similar surge in interest on social media, with Twitter activity up by more than 300%. The source, it appears, is the same Reddit group that sparked a dramatic but highly controversial bull run in the stock price of U.S. consumer electronics firm GameStop.

A parody Twitter account posing as the moderator for r/Wallstreetbets queried:

Dogecoin already has something in common with $GME, both assets having seen publicity tweets from Tesla CEO and world's richest man, Elon Musk in recent weeks. As Cointelegraph reported, Musk's tongue-in-cheek endorsement of DOGE was enough to induce serious price action.

On Reddit itself, users attempted to insert hints to invest in the meme-based altcoin, despite dedicated posts being removed by r/Wallstreetbets moderators.

BTC price spooks amid GameStop row

Data from Cointelegraph Markets and Tradingview showed any bullish momentum left in Bitcoin dissipate on Wednesday after rejection at highs near $33,000.

""Another $30,000 retest for #Bitcoin,"" Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe summarized.

Despite aiming for another test of monthly lows, Bitcoin's price action hardly surprised regular market participants. For fellow trader Scott Melker, it was a case of ""wait and see"" until the longer time frames completed.

""6 hour looks the same as 4 hour. 12 hour needs 10 more hours, so barely worth watching. But the potential is there. Bottom line: no clear signal yet, but worth keeping an eye if they can build up,"" he wrote in part of a series of tweets on Wednesday.

The resolution of current price action would, nonetheless, be a ""moment of truth"" for BTC/USD, he said.

As Cointelegraph reported, attention was broadly focused on GameStop stock throughout the day, after its 700% fortnightly gains caught the attention of both the media and regulators.

Likewise defying expectations was movie theater chain AMC, which gained 240% in a day after avoiding bankruptcy.

Bitcoin, despite being a more cost-effective buy-in than at almost any time since Christmas, failed to hold the limelight.

Cryptocurrency skeptics meanwhile used the GameStop debacle to pour scorn on Bitcoin and those who argued that decentralized investment was a beneficial phenomenon.

""Attention #Bitcoin HODLers: The only people who will walk away with any real winnings from the #GameStop short-squeeze will be those smart enough to sell. Those who HODL will likely lose it all. Bitcoin HODLers will meet the same fate if they fail to realize their paper profits,"" gold bug Peter Schiff tweeted.

A glance at the subreddit used for stocks plays, r/Wallstreetbets, meanwhile showed that user strategies focused on hodling, not selling, their newly profitable stock — at the expense of unprepared hedge funds.

""Retail reflexivity in action in traditional markets,"" commented trader Philip Swift, adding:

This round of investment institutions include: CMS Holding, Altonomy, SevenX, Zonff Partners, Paka, Timestop Capital, Incuba Alpha, Oasis Capital, Kernel Capital and Loopring co-founders Jay and Steve Guo, and other individual investors. Seed round investment institutions SNZ Holding and DFG continue to make additional investments.

After Bifrost completed the round of financing, it experienced rapid development, accumulated new community members, advanced its products, gained in-depth cooperation partners, and established a solid roadmap in just a few months. It shows the growth and transformation that Bifrost has experienced. With some hard work starting in 2020, Bifrost has now completed more than 80% of the basic function development. By March 2021, the last version of the Asgard CC4 testnet will have been released before the mainnet.

As the significant pledge derivative protocol in the Polkadot ecosystem, Bifrost already has over 8,200 active on-chain addresses. They participate in the contribution of the Bifrost ecosystem through testnet incentives, cross-chain testing, bug fixing, article writing, content translation, etc. In the Asgard testnet, there were a total of 1,231 nodes from seven countries that participated, and the number of online nodes reached 890. There were 66,385 times of EOS cross-chains during the testnet. .

Three days before Ethereum 2.0’s Beacon Chain launch, Bifrost launched the Eth2 staking derivative vETH as well as the first phase of vETH, called Mint Drop. The highest mint amount was 15,088.7563 vETH, and Bifrost cooperated with layer-two protocol network Loopring, both promoted vETH liquidity, which exceeded $900,000 liquidity in Ethereum layer-two network. In general, vETH will be launched in four stages. Before the Bifrost mainnet goes online, vETH will already be on Ethereum’s layer one, and its layer two accumulated the initial liquidity scale and a stable discount rate of 5%–10%, which shows the market’s recognition of the decentralized acceptance of vETH. As soon as Bifrost mainnet goes online, these vETH will become the first batch of cross-chain assets entering the Polkadot ecosystem. Bifrost is looking forward to connecting with Kusama and Polkadot in the near future.

After undergoing a transformation from zero to one, Bifrost is about to usher in growth from one to 100. Today, Bifrost is proud to announce that it has received a new round of financing of $1.55 million. New strategic partners Altonomy and Loopring help Bifrost to build liquidity for pledged derivatives, and link global resources for Bifrost on the market, financing and strategy levels.

A similar benefit has occurred from using cryptocurrencies as a backbone for the most recent wave of decentralized finance, also known as DeFi.

Irish AI and robotics enterprise Elis Technologies is now betting heavily on the mutual synergies between these sectors, which could result in a positive feedback loop for both.

Elis believes that the primary driver of DeFi is that individuals who were previously locked out of access to financial instruments are now able to freely access them on demand and that this can be extended to include autonomous machines as well.

Elis has therefore recognized that the only entry point missing in the field of robotics was the ability for individuals and machines to interface with each other directly — in simple terms: a marketplace for robots, smart contracts and drones.

As a solution, Elis Technologies launched its decentralized Elis Token (XLS), thereby creating the first market for Hardware-as-a-Service developed by an established robotics company.

The robots and drones developed by Elis Technologies deal primarily with leak detection and verifiably reducing the environmental impact in various industries — a welcome use-case for the incontrovertible cryptographic proofs provided by blockchain technology.

The XLS token uses a customized version of the popular ERC-20 standard and can, therefore, freely interact with user-made Ethereum smart contracts, such as Uniswap liquidity provision, farming and more. Furthermore, the Elis token can be redeemed for all services offered by Elis Technologies.

At the time of writing, Elis Token has already been successfully listed on Uniswap and the IDEX decentralized exchange, with further listings on the horizon.

He explained:

“Bitcoin will be more valuable in the future. The dollar is so inflated and devalued. Today’s 0.0003 Bitcoin may only be worth $10. But maybe five years later, 10 years later, 20 years later, it could be worth $1,000. At that time, the purchasing power of Bitcoin would be even higher.”

Lee believes that the recent bull Bitcoin market is driven by institutional investors and is rising much faster than he anticipated. He said:

“Some big U.S. companies, including MicroStrategy, are investing heavily in Bitcoin. In addition, some family offices are buying Bitcoin and exchanging some money for Bitcoin, which is a good promotion for it.”

The mission of Ballet Wallet

According to Lee, Ballet Wallet, a physical multi-currency non-electronic cryptocurrency cold wallet with high durability and storage efficiency, can be used as a better key carrier to let the public know about Bitcoin.

Lee explained that hardware wallets are actually hard to operate. It would normally take people two or three hours to set up and back up. In general, traditional hardware wallets are only suitable for immediate use.

Lee predicts that in 20 years from now, digital currency will go mainstream just like the worldwide access to the internet for today. Most people in the world will hold digital assets, whether it’s Bitcoin or other digital currencies.

Does he believe that physical wallets such as Ballet Wallet could help the masses to learn faster about what a private key is? What is currency transfer? What is a blockchain? What is broadcast trading?

Lee said Ballet Wallet is made up of high-grade stainless steel material with water-proof and fire-proof properties. It has a card-like design with compact handling and eradicates all the hassle that comes with setting up a newly purchased or created cryptocurrency wallet.

People also don’t have to set up or configure any settings after receiving your ordered Ballet Wallet. Both private and public address keys are situated on the steel material using a novel and highly secured technique.

Forked Bitcoin support

There are many hard forked Bitcoins, these include Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Gold, etc. Lee believes the strength of Bitcoin is its true decentralization. He said:

“If you respect decentralization, you have to realize that Bitcoin can be forked at any time. Because if Bitcoin does not allow forking, that means Bitcoin is not open.”

He thinks Bitcoin forking is not a bad thing. Because it’s truly decentralized and supported by consensus, it is natural for Bitcoin to hard fork. He says “the market will decide which one is the mainstream. Now it's obvious that Bitcoin is the mainstream.” Lee added that Ballet Wallet also supports all forked Bitcoins.

However, he also pointed out that institutional investors still only favor Bitcoin but gave Ethereum Classic and Ethereum as examples. Although some people believe Ethereum Classic could be better in theory than Ethereum, the market has proved otherwise. He added:

“ETH is more useful and valuable than Ethererum Classic. So later, ETC gradually became worthless. Although there may have been fund investment at that time, ETH is still the mainstream now.”

Satoshi Nakamoto prediction

As Lee is one of the core members of the Bitcoin Foundation, he got into Bitcoin as early as 2011. During the interview, he mused about who the real Bitcoin creator was. He offered this prediction:","['haven', 'wallet', 'later', 'mainstream', 'real', 'market', 'bobby', 'ballet', 'ethereum', 'wallets', 'lee', 'safe', 'bitcoin', 'hard']","At that time, the purchasing power of Bitcoin would be even higher.”Lee believes that the recent bull Bitcoin market is driven by institutional investors and is rising much faster than he anticipated.

United States governing bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have all pursued various types of legal enforcement.

From December 2020, there has been an even further regulatory push, including a proposal from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network aimed at heightened crypto wallet overwatch. What do crypto industry players think of regulation at present?

Dean Steinbeck, co-founder of Horizen Labs, told Cointelegraph that, indeed, in conjunction with increasing institutional involvement, “notices from entities such as the SEC, OCC, IRS and FinCEN have become more regular.” He added: “Over the recent few months, we’ve continued seeing an increase in institutional adoption of Bitcoin/cryptocurrency slowly but surely closing the educational gap between traditional and decentralized finance.”

Regulatory waters remain murky

Over the course of 2020, a number of sizable mainstream entities and individuals, including MicroStrategy, MassMutual, Square and Paul Tudor Jones, unveiled their large purchases of Bitcoin. In 2019 and 2020, U.S. regulators increased their activity in the space, both in terms of enforcement as well as clarity.

“However, these notices and regulations are often convoluted and unclear, which, in turn, makes them meaningless and misguided in the eyes of the crypto community,” Steinbeck said, adding:

“What is preventing the creation of transparent and fair regulation? Those drafting these regulations do not interact with crypto on a day-to-day basis. If we can change the system in which these notices, rules and policies are created, the community may be more receptive to proposed regulations being put into place.”

The past two years or so have yielded a number of regulatory actions. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency gave national banks the go-ahead for crypto custody. The Internal Revenue Service attempted to issue clarity on taxes, although the agency’s effort added confusion in the process. The IRS also added a question about digital asset ownership to its tax reporting forms.

More recently, the CFTC and DoJ went after crypto derivatives exchanges BitMEX, the SEC filed a suit against Ripple, claiming its XRP asset as a security, and FinCEN proposed a rule to monitor the flow of funds to self-custodied crypto wallets, as well as between platforms.

“As an industry, we’ve come a long way but, in the same vein, are just getting started,” Konstantin Richter, founder and CEO of Blockdaemon, told Cointelegraph when asked about his thoughts on the current crypto regulatory scene, adding: “This past year, crypto regulators seemed to be moving faster and asking better questions — not easier questions per se.”

Richter noted a present opportunity to guide governing bodies in learning more about the industry. He added:

“I think we are collectively in a position to put our best foot forward to encourage and inform regulators on the best ways for them to be partners in innovation with the crypto industry at large and also enact more of the safeguards and standards required for continued institutional and mainstream adoption.”

In terms of educated government rule, President Joe Biden’s pick for SEC chairman, Gary Gensler, will likely bring a wealth of crypto knowledge into his position. Gensler taught a course on crypto and blockchain at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management. Recent Cointelegraph reporting reveals Gensler’s immense knowledge of the industry.

Digital asset regulation is not a foreign concept

“Crypto regulation has always been an important topic, with news or even just rumors causing major price fluctuations in the past,” Philip Salter, head of mining operations for Genesis Mining, told Cointelegraph.

Regulation has increased in line with crypto’s growth as an asset class. Part of its departure from a regulatory gray area can include government agencies fielding comments from the sector. Industry participants, for example, flooded FinCEN with comments recently on the governing body’s proposed crypto wallet regulation.

“We are seeing a much more open and knowledgeable discussion on crypto regulation lately,” Salter said. “The big new topic seems to be if KYC is required for personal wallets and coin holdings,” he explained, adding:

“This would have major implications and possibly cause some panic if enacted in the U.S. I think, generally, it’s the best not to worry too much about the short-term rumors and regulations but, instead, to take a step back and acknowledge that it will take years to reach a final conclusion on crypto regulation. We are talking about a financial revolution here, there will surely be battles.”

Erik Finman, an early crypto buyer who became a millionaire via his Bitcoin investments, sees regulation as a long-standing point of importance. “Regulation has always been the greatest challenge to cryptocurrency, and I think there’s been a bit of a pause with some of the political turbulence focusing on other things,” Finman told Cointelegraph, adding:

“Under the new administration, cryptocurrency advocates will need to do their best to work with the government to create win-win scenarios.”

As the U.S. continues firming up its government’s roles after a presidential changeover on Jan. 20, 2021, the atmosphere around crypto regulation remains to be seen. Gensler as the SEC’s chairman will bring a wealth of crypto knowledge to the commission, which could pave the way for educated regulation.

Blockchain tech can replace slow, paper-based processes, as well as improve security.

However, many of the platforms in use today suffer from poor design. Networks become clogged with traffic too easily, resulting in latency issues and, ultimately, a sub-par user experience.

According to a 2019 McKinsey report, there are now over 20 billion connected devices in the world, all of which “require management, storage and retrieval of data.” However, blockchain design is ill-equipped to handle this immense wave of data, which is creating pressure on networks to maintain fast speed and enough storage capacity.

Making blockchains sustainable

Transaction speed is important to blockchain adoption and sustainability. However, there’s a tradeoff to performance.

There are several factors that can delay a confirmation, but a congested network is a major cause. When many users send transactions, there will be longer queues for nodes to validate them. That’s because miners or validators who operate a network conduct their validation based on a publicly shared ledger. While this process reduces risk, it can also sacrifice transaction speed especially when there’s plenty of traffic.

Developers are also grappling with how to permanently store blocks on-chain. A huge increase in storage requirements can lead to a network becoming slow and unstable. A protocol needs participant nodes to be able to transmit and download the chain within a short period of time.

The blockchain trilemma is a technical challenge between scalability, decentralization and security. Developers can achieve any two of these factors but need to sacrifice the third.

Instant confirmations are becoming a critical enabler for adoption because decentralized innovations compete with traditional solutions in the marketplace. In financial services, for instance, there is a compelling demand for high throughput and low latency networks that can potentially match the capacity of the Visa and MasterCard networks, which process tens of thousands of transactions per second.

Matching users’ expectations

In the last year or so, we’ve seen several developments that bring near-instant confirmations closer to reality. Protocol-level improvements such as signature aggregation and block proposal pipelining are two examples.

Signature aggregation allows validators with multiple cryptographic Boneh-Lynn-Shacham keys to aggregate all signatures into a single aggregated signature and send as a single peer-to-peer message. With block proposal pipelining, a validator starts proposing a new block immediately after collecting two-thirds of the signatures. It means that a new block proposal process and collection of the last one-third of signatures happen concurrently.

The net result of these improvements is a notable reduction in block finality time down to as little as one or two seconds in a live mainnet environment. Two-second finality is a disruptive, near-instant feature within the digital asset industry, given that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) take minutes to confirm at higher fees. To put things into perspective, it’s the kind of speed that would match mainstream users’ expectations who swipe plastic cards at a grocery store.

Another solution being tried by several blockchain projects is called sharding. The sharding method partitions a database into smaller chunks so that nodes can process transactions more quickly, as well as update a shared ledger in real-time.

Sharding has been commonly acknowledged as the best solution to achieve blockchain scalability because it increases the number of transactions per second and requires less storage for nodes. Sharding solves blockchain bloat without sacrificing too much on decentralization and security. Bloat refers to the challenge of finding enough storage to house an immense amount of accumulated data.

Other solutions are also being explored, though they have yet to come to fruition on a mainnet. Danish researchers have proposed a solution involving a separate validation layer to achieve finality that is partially synchronous with a standard block validation process. However, this has not yet been proven to be effective on a live mainnet.

The imperative is there. Fast finality opens up possibilities for DApp developers to build the fastest and highly usable applications for real adoption. For instance, Brian Brooks, acting head of the Office for the Comptroller of the Currency, recently wrote in the Financial Times of a vision for “self-driving banks.”

Solving the trilemma

Decreasing block time cannot and should not come at the expense of blockchain security. Solving the trilemma means ensuring that network decentralization remains a priority. The solutions outlined here show that it’s possible for a blockchain project to achieve decentralization, security and lightning-quick confirmations.

With decentralized applications, a fast and responsive experience leads to high user satisfaction and retention rate. Waiting for tens of seconds or even minutes to confirm a transaction is the last thing we want for mass adoption of Web 3.0 applications.

As the technology gains wide adoption globally, shared ledgers must provide compelling use cases, as well as improve key performance indicators and increase returns on investment.

Bitcoin price holds strong despite miners selling

Despite the recent volatility, institutional investors continue to show an increased interest in Bitcoin and are willing to pay a premium to get exposure to CME’s Bitcoin futures contracts.

Even selling pressure from Bitcoin miners, who have been selling at levels not seen since BTC price topped out at $14,000 in July 2019, has not been able to satisfy increasing demand. Unlike previous years, mass selling from miners is not negatively affecting the long-term price of BTC, as shown by data from CryptoQuant.

Bitcoin miner’s outflow. Source: CryptoQuant

According to Lennard Neo, the head of research at Stack Funds, the current miner sell-off is likely to continue in the near-term due to the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday.

Neo said:

“Miners are increasingly exiting their positions as the holiday approaches. This also suggests that the floor price for which miners are comfortable holding Bitcoins has yet to be found and we expect this volatility to persist in the coming weeks.”

Growing interest from institutions and the emergence of DeFi are big drivers of Bitcoin price growth. As the market heads into the Chinese New Year holiday, the key level of support to watch is now $34,000 while a move higher is likely to face resistance at $38,000.

The $4.9 billion worth of BTC futures that expired on Jan. 29 appears to have little effect on the market as this past week’s Robinhood ordeal is bringing more attention to the cryptocurrency industry.

The traditional markets faced a new wave of pressure which led to the worst weekly performance for the S&P 500. The Dow, NASDAQ and S&P 500 all finished the day negative, down 2.03%, 2.0% and 1.93% respectively.

Altcoins show signs of growth

While Bitcoin price struggled to hold the $34,000 level, DOGE made its way into the top-10 and a number of altcoins saw bullish breakouts.

XRP and Stellar (XLM) have both rose by roughly 9% in the past 24-hours, while Voyager Token (VGX) continued to climb higher, currently up 70% and trading at $1.77.

Editor's note

“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,” begins the most famous English-language story of the French Revolution. Though many would disagree with me, I would argue that neither is true of today. Maybe that’s why what passes for revolutions these days is so dependent on memes and lunatic viral conspiracy theories.

That same memetic energy has brought together an unholy matrimony of anarchists, leftists, populists, jilted investment bros, Boogie boys and survivalists, AOC stans, and a dose of antisemitism — the sort of audience that only finds common ground in a colosseum, united in bloodlust, cheering wildly for the death of a hedge fund.

It was the bizarrest of times.

Despite the best efforts of the digital revolutionaries, no Bastille is being stormed — though I would not be surprised if AOC has daydreamed about melting down the Wall Street bull and reshaping it into a working bronze guillotine. But there is no question that this week has been turbulent, playing host to more than its fair share of conflicts between the hoi polloi, arming themselves with digital tools, and institutions. Despite the revolutionary metaphors that have haunted this intro like a spectre reportedly did Europe, I don’t think this shapes out to be quite the battle of good vs. evil that some think. But it’s certainly something. And the memes have, in all fairness, been something else.

Robinhood vs. Reddit (vs. Congress)

Stealing the world’s attention and forcing every phone scroller to learn what short-selling is was the deranged saga of Robinhood and Reddit.

It was well over a year in the making, but only this week did the world’s attention to the pending standoff between major hedge fund Melvin Capital and a Reddit group of amateur investors who mostly seem pretty intoxicated. Intervening between the two was retail trading app Robinhood and Gamestop’s extravagantly over-shorted GME stock.

The scene was set. r/WallStreetBets had mobilized a substantial squad of retail traders willing to lose their whole investment in GME in an attempt to short-squeeze Melvin into bankruptcy. And, oh yeah, after such a short squeeze would come strong odds that GME spikes dramatically as Melvin was forced to buy up the market to pay off its debts. That is, until Robinhood and a host of other retail apps turned off the buying function for GME on their apps.

While a broker-dealer has the right to stop trading in the event of major volatility, Robinhood investors — many of them holding GME as a result of a giveaway on the app — saw it as force majeure on behalf of Wall Street and a major assault on the app’s own userbase. The internet as a whole was outraged as well, heavily in favor of Wall Street Bets, who seemed to represent the little guy, despite being a pretty aggressive and often quite offensive crew.

Internet outrage, however, is not policy. Nor is it even the will of the people. The role of social media in manipulation of information has already taken center stage in a great deal of political debate, and there’s a good argument to be made that WSB is going to move that conversation into manipulating markets.

But new guard in Congress and the White House are more eager to take the opportunity to bludgeon Wall Street as a clear signal of the end of Trumpian indulgence of financial kingpins. Democrats have spent the past year agog at a broad bull market that seems damn near idolatrous in the face of a pandemic-ridden economy. I suspect that however much Robinhood and its retail investors will be the pretext for everything we see from incoming Democrat-led financial legislation, the results will be more about proving a point.

Stonks, meanwhile, have had a rough day, and it looks like Robinhood’s loss will be crypto’s gain as retail interest turns to crypto exchanges.

Iran vs. Signal

Iranians are reporting outages in access to encrypted messenger Signal.

Having attacked Bitcoin mining, accessed WhatApp messages, and done its best to cut off Telegram, Iran is now trying to cut off Signal, which has seen a boom thanks to new public interest in its end-to-end encryption.

Iran is a remarkably interesting place. It is home to an authoritarian theocracy grafted onto a remarkably well-educated and tech-savvy population. Both sides are miffed about being locked out of the global economy and information cycle. But while the regime busies itself getting around these blocks and, especially, sanctions, it seeks to monopolize that access at the expense of the people.

Netherlands vs. Peer-to-peer

Crypto users and exchanges are fighting the Netherlands’ intensive and, they say, intrusive know-your-customer rules.

The Netherlands is low-key home to some of the most demanding requirements for crypto exchanges in the EU and, by extension, the world. Since allowing crypto exchanges back into the country under a new regulatory regime a few months ago, De Nederlandsche Bank has instituted a reporting regime for transfers to wallets off-exchange that the U.S. Treasury can only dream of.

In pursuit of information on ultimate beneficiary owners, De Nederlandshe Bank requires exchanges not only identify the owner of crypto wallets to which clients are trying to withdraw funds, but also that the clients prove that those wallets belong to them.

Bitonic, the crypto exchange filing against the Dutch central bank, says there is no legal basis for that level of personal data collection.

Far from the largest country in the EU, the Netherlands has, nonetheless, maintained its centuries-old status as a trading hub for stocks. The fate of its KYC requirements may well determine whether that status carries on into crypto.

“It's always important to have free and transparent markets for all traders, and maintaining an open trading book that is available for everyone to use is a responsibility of all trading venue providers,” Byworth told Cointelegraph. “The GameStop issue and platform responses will likely see crypto assets come more into focus.”

On Jan 22, one share of GME cost about $53, according to TradingView.com data. By Jan. 28, GME hit a peak of roughly $508 per share. In the hours following its peak price, the asset dropped all the way back down to approximately $113. Since then, GME has remained volatile in price, ranging between about $197 and $411.

“I think it’s clear indication of how broken and fundamentally rigged the traditional financial system is,” Aleks Svetski, co-founder and CEO of Amber, a Bitcoin investing platform, told Cointelegraph.

“This will set all of the wrong precedents and is one of the final nails in the coffin for the relationship between Main Street and Wall Street,” he added. “The WSB people are also likely to move to Bitcoin next as they realise it’s the only thing that can’t be turned off.”

The folks thought to be responsible for the surging stocks are part of subreddit called Wall Street Bets, sometimes shortened to WSB. The squad reportedly looked for stocks with vast short-seller interest and bought up shares of those assets, causing price rallies, a CNBC article said on Wednesday. Robinhood suspended the purchase of certain associated assets on Thursday.

What type of effects might Robinhood’s asset purchasing suspension have on the crypto space going forward? “Situations like this show why regulation is important and ensuring there are orderly markets, equal access to information for everyone and trading venues that provide customers with fair opportunities to trade, hedge and take a position,” said Byworth, adding:

“In crypto, there have been some exchanges that have not provided this kind of trading environment, and often it is the customer who loses. It is incumbent on exchanges to provide a safe, transparent and compliant trading environment so that investors can access markets that are trusted - by regulators and by traders. At EQUOS, we do not trade against clients on our platform like most crypto exchanges nor do we sell our clients data to High Frequency Traders like many traditional brokers have done.”

As the price fell, these CME Bitcoin futures traded at a 1% discount to Coinbase, which signaled a disarrangement between both markets.

Good morning.



Bitcoin spot has almost full retraced the weekly.



CME bitcoin futs are both backwardian and expire Friday. That is all. — i.am.nomad (@IamNomad) January 27, 2021

Immediately, traders suggested that futures contracts, which were set to expire in 48-hours, were responsible for the price dump. Now, before rushing to quick conclusions, one should note that every short sale needs a buyer (long) of the same size.

Thus, there can not be an open interest imbalance. Moreover, futures contracts can be extended (rolled over) for a future date, as long as its holder has enough margin to cover it.

Instead of assuming that one singular factor impacted Bitcoin’s price, it’s better to analyze the intraday movements of both markets (CME futures and spot exchanges).

The futures premium (or basis) measures the premium of longer-term futures contracts to the current spot (regular markets) levels. Whenever this indicator fades or turns negative, this is an alarming red flag. This situation is also known as backwardation and indicates bearish sentiment.

These fixed-month contracts usually trade at a slight premium, indicating that sellers request more money to withhold settlement longer. On healthy markets, futures should trade at a 5% to 15% annualized premium, otherwise known as contango.

The unalignment between each market could have been caused by long contracts liquidations driven by traders with insufficient margin, thin order books, or an intense price action ahead of the remaining spot markets.

Therefore, this data by itself does not uncover a cause or a consequence. Furthermore, a similar movement took place on Jan. 18.

Take notice of how the CME BTC premium collapsed to a negative 1% despite no apparent volatility taking place on the BTC spot exchanges. It is safe to say that this event held zero relation to the market's price action.

By analyzing the Jan. 27 crash on a more granular view, it is possible to determine whether the negative CME premium preceded the market volatility.

The above data levels show that instead of acting as a leading indicator, the CME Bitcoin futures premium plunged much later in the day. As Bitcoin tested the $31,800 resistance, the sell pressure at CME continued, causing the momentarily price difference.

Multiple reasons could be behind this effect, so comparing the intraday price on multiple exchanges might explain if CME led the downturn.

To summarize, there is no evidence of any price anticipation by the CME Bitcoin futures. These markets are incredibly arbitrated and will typically move in tandem. Moreover, the usual premium might face some momentary discrepancies similar to those that occurred on Jan. 18, regardless of Bitcoin's volatility at the time.

A Robinhood spokesperson told CNBC that the company would ""keep monitoring market conditions and communicating with our customers.

Robinhood has faced recent criticism for suspending the trading of a number of traditional stocks, including GameStop, that were being supported by retail investors to the detriment of Wall Street hedge funds.

This prompted U.S. congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to describe the move as unacceptable. Ocasio-Cortez, who sits on the House Financial Services committee, then hosted an hour long Twitch stream, discussing the topic with a number of guests, which pulled in 300,000 viewers.

One of the questions that the congresswoman posed was: ""How do you actually shift power back into the hands of everyday people? Ultimately that's what this is about.”

Robinhood's ""Instant Buying"" functionality is a paid feature that gives customers instant access to funds from bank deposits and stock trades.

The suspension of instant buying power for crypto through the trading app comes hot on the heels of the same group of retail investors, led by Redditors from the r/Wallstreetbets subreddit, pumping Dogecoin (DOGE) to surge 900%.

This has led to the meme-based coin reentering the top 10 digital assets by market capitalization for the first time since 2015.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) has also been pumping, gaining $5,000 in a matter of minutes, following Elon Musk changing his Twitter bio to simply “#bitcoin.”

Musk followed this with a cryptic tweet, stating only that, ""In retrospect, it was inevitable"".","['stock', 'retail', 'doge', 'market', 'spike', 'instant', 'deposits', 'crypto', 'suspends', 'robinhood', 'power', 'pumping', 'cryptocurrency', 'trading', 'purchases']","Stock and cryptocurrency trading platform Robinhood has temporarily disabled instant deposits for cryptocurrency purchases as of Friday, citing ""extraordinary market conditions.""

A “fork of a fork” based on Litecoin (LTC), the coin has earned a unique reputation and a considerable cult status within the cryptocurrency space.

Unlike other projects, Dogecoin has not seen any protocol upgrades or developments since 2015. Indeed, the success of DOGE derives more from the community-based efforts and the power of memes than from any tangible technical advancements.

However, it would be incorrect to say the “coin” has zero utility. In fact, its early adoption was in the microtipping arena on social media. Dogecoin showcased one of the earliest examples of how cryptocurrencies could be used to monetize the content creation space. Rather than the usual “likes,” forum posters could receive more impactful recognition in the form of a meme coin with actual U.S. dollar value.

The Dogecoin scene has such synergistic community participation that tokenholders famously supported NASCAR driver Josh Wise and the Jamaican bobsled team back in 2014.

Who let the DOGE out?

Dogecoin briefly entered the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization for the first time since 2015 after a dizzying climb that saw the token price increase almost tenfold. It all started when irreverent retail traders on the U.S. stock market were prevented from buying more GameStop and AMC stock on Thursday.

At the time, the retail horde that had banded together on r/Wallstreetbets had seemingly caught established Wall Street short-sellers in a huge short squeeze. While retail brokers suspended the trading of GME and some other stocks, some Redditors were probably still pumped with nervous trading energy and turned their attention to DOGE.

On Thursday, Twitter user “WSB Chairman” asked, “Has Doge ever been to a dollar?” to his almost 750,000 followers. A storm of social media activity ensued, with Dogecoin becoming the first-ever altcoin to surpass Bitcoin (BTC) in terms of daily Twitter mention volume.

Commenting on the link between social media activity and Dogecoin price action, Joshua Frank, co-founder and CEO of crypto research firm The Tie, told Cointelegraph: “Everyone universally agrees that no one is investing in ‘fundamentals’ of Dogecoin.” He added further:

“As DOGE enjoys substantial support on different social media platforms, its price reacts very heavily to spikes in conversation. We have also noticed that support for Dogecoin comes in waves, there will be periods of days or weeks when the DOGE meme gets hot again and a lot of retail customers start putting their money behind it.”

Dogecoin’s price surge did coincide with a flurry of new activity in the crypto space, with exchanges like Binance reporting a flood of new account openings. Indeed, several exchanges halted withdrawals of the altcoin, with the volume dipping significantly.

Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, also weighed in on the relationship between social media hype and Dogecoin price action, telling Cointelegraph that DOGE is “probably and measurably the most successful joke in history, with a current market cap of over $7bn.” He went on to add:

“As it was born of a meme it’s an attractive target for groups on social media. Being relatively smaller than other cryptos but with a large awareness means that it’s likely more straightforward to mobilise a campaign or movement around it with an immediate and major impact on the price.”

This service disruption typical of Bitcoin price movements has seen the DOGE token price decline 50%. However, social media sentiment is still high, with several posters calling for a $0.10 price as a short-term target.

Dogecoin will need a 2,000% price rally to reach the $1 milestone set by WSB Chairman. Also, as previously reported by Cointelegraph, Dogecoin’s 24-hour trading volume surpassed the $5-billion mark for the first time on Binance, exceeding Bitcoin’s trading activity on the platform.

Memetic price action for DOGE

The current enthusiasm around Dogecoin is not the first social-media-driven hype cycle in the history of the popular meme coin. Indeed, DOGE’s entire existence is built on memetic engineering and the emerging meme economy.

Back in 2020, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted about Dogecoin on two separate occasions, with the token price responding positively in both instances. Last year, Musk came out on top in a Twitter poll to decide who should become the CEO of Dogecoin. The Tesla CEO would later refer to himself as the “former CEO of Dogecoin.”

Musk’s impact on crypto price action is not only restricted to Dogecoin. Bitcoin went on an upward trajectory after Musk updated his Twitter bio to feature only one word: “Bitcoin.”

Related: World's richest man Elon Musk boosts Bitcoin price by 20% — Is $40K back in play?

Just as in the case of Dogecoin back in 2020, Musk flying the Bitcoin flag triggered a massive “Elon candle” for BTC price action. The largest crypto by market capitalization surged by over $5,000 in only a few minutes, eclipsing the $38,000 mark for the first time since mid-January.

Following Musk’s lead, other notable crypto proponents both within and outside the industry — including participants in the wider tech and social media space — have also begun to fly the Bitcoin banner. Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, a noted Ethererum proponent, has also joined the trend.

Apart from Musk, a viral campaign on the social media platform TikTok also created a significant upward push in Dogecoin price action. Indeed, DOGE managed to ride the enthusiasm created by the viral videos to reach a two-year high at the time.

Asset valuation in the age of social media

The GameStop saga once again put the efficient market hypothesis argument, which says that stock prices are a reflection of fair market value, into stark relief. Indeed, retail traders using publicly available information correctly deduced that mass-buying GME stock would put short-selling hedge funds in trouble.

Under the hypothesis, such a situation — beating the market — can only be achieved by pure luck. However, in the modern age of social media, such concepts are now being increasingly challenged by a horde of irreverent folks who seemingly have an ax to grind with the establishment.

For Aaron Khoo, head of listings at crypto data aggregator CoinMarketCap, the Dogecoin surge is indicative of a much deeper reawakening among retail investors, as he told Cointelegraph:

“Much like the GME Gamma squeeze, Dogecoin’s ascent epitomizes a psychological desire to take the mickey out of the man — a loose agglomeration of individuals ultimately wanted to make a statement that the ostensibly credentialed Wall Street hedge funds were in no better position to arrogate upon themselves the right to make pronouncements on what an asset’s fair valuation ought to be.”

For now, Dogecoin is still flashing green in terms of its 24-hour price action. The earlier jump above $0.08 constituted an all-time-high price for the meme coin, becoming one of the few altcoins to reclaim and go beyond its 2018 price records.

It is a commonly held belief that a Dogecoin pump is one of the precursors of an “alt season.” Indeed, given the cyclical nature of Dogecoin’s price action, a reversal of the DOGE/BTC chart often signals periods of significant gains for the altcoin market.

The reason is fairly simple, as DOGE pumps are based purely on “pumpamentals” — retail presence spurred on by a social media hype — which often causes the price of Dogecoin to spike. This retail-driven fear of missing out usually spreads to other altcoins.

However, bullish fatigue in the Bitcoin space is also another ingredient for alt season. At the moment, BTC appears to still have more fuel to burn, so the market may have to wait and see. Also, the traditional alts have to deal with pressure from the decentralized finance space — blue chips that have proved to be favorites among crypto investors.","['retail', 'doge', 'display', 'market', 'crypto', 'dogecoin', 'surge', 'action', 'media', 'power', 'bitcoin', 'price', 'memes', 'social']","Anyone who has been in the crypto space over the last few years will undoubtedly be familiar with Dogecoin (DOGE) and how social media activity drives its price action.

This truth was demonstrated today when Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, simply wrote 'Bitcoin’ in his Twitter bio. Crypto traders and Musk followers immediately noticed and Bitcoin price conveniently shot up a few minutes after the tweet.

When BTC price makes a sharp directional move, traders buy into the breakout and short-sellers are squeezed out of their positions. That is what seems to have happened with Bitcoin (BTC) as the sentiment swiftly turned bullish.

It is not only Bitcoin that has seen a pick up in sentiment. Rumors were afloat that Reddit users, who were recently responsible for GameStop’s massive surge in price, were discussing whether or not Dogecoin’s (DOGE) could be pushed to $1. This resulted in a huge spike in Dogecoin’s price.

Trading with excessive greed and emotion can be risky. While professional traders may make money in such volatile environments, the novice retail trader usually gets stuck at higher levels and has to bear heavy losses. Therefore, traders should keep their greed in check and stick to their trading strategy.

In volatile environments, the price action and trends can change quickly. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to spot the support and resistance levels that could be helpful in making trading decisions.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin held the 50-day simple moving average ($30,065) on Jan. 27 and dip buyers aggressively purchased on Jan. 28, which pushed the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($33,555).

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The buying continued today and the bulls have propelled the price above the downtrend line. This move invalidates the short-term bearish view on the BTC/USD pair.

There is a minor resistance at $38,000, but if this level is crossed, the rally could extend to $40,000 and then to $41,959.63. The current all-time high may act as stiff resistance but if the momentum can push the price above it, the journey to $50,000 may begin.

Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from either overhead resistance, the bulls are likely to defend the 20-day EMA. If they succeed, it will suggest traders are buying on dips. The bulls will then again try to resume the uptrend.

The trend will turn in favor of the bears if the pair turns down and plummets below the critical $28,850 support.

ETH/USD

Ether (ETH) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($1,234) on Jan. 28, which shows the bulls are aggressively buying on every minor dip and are not waiting for a deeper correction to enter long positions.

ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls had driven the price above the $1,400 overhead resistance today but are currently struggling to hold the higher levels. If they can sustain the price above $1,400, a retest of the all-time high at $1,473.096 is possible.

A breakout to a new all-time high will open the gates for a further rally to $1,675 and then $2,000. The upsloping moving averages suggest advantage to the bulls, but the negative divergence on the relative strength index (RSI) points to a weakening momentum.

If the bears can sink and sustain the ETH/USD pair below the uptrend line, it will indicate weakness.

DOT/USD

Polkadot’s (DOT) strong rebound off the $14.7259 support on Jan. 28 shows the bulls are aggressively buying on dips to this level. The altcoin could now extend its stay inside the $14.7259 to $19.40 range for a few more days.

DOT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

A shallow correction after a strong rally and consolidation near the overhead resistance are signs of strength. This shows traders are not booking profits in a hurry as they anticipate the uptrend to resume.

If the bulls can push the price above $19.40, the next leg of the uptrend could begin. The first target objective is $24 and then $27. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 60 suggest the bulls are in control.

This bullish view will invalidate if the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the $14.7259 support. Such a move will suggest traders are aggressively booking profits and that could result in a drop to the 61.8% retracement at $11.8383.

XRP/USD

The bulls defended the $0.245 support on Jan. 27 and XRP started a relief rally on Jan. 28. This shows traders are accumulating at lower levels. The flat 20-day EMA ($0.28) and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest the selling pressure has reduced.

XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls had pushed the price above the downtrend line today, but they could not sustain the higher levels. This indicates, traders are offloading their positions at higher levels as they do not expect a sustained up-move.

If the price turns down from the current level, the bears will again try to break the $0.245 support. If they succeed, a drop to $0.17351 is possible. On the other hand, if the bulls can sustain the price above the downtrend line, the XRP/USD pair may rally to $0.3855.

ADA/USD

Cardano (ADA) bounced off the support line of the ascending channel on Jan. 28, which shows the bulls are accumulating on dips. The buying has continued today and the altcoin has risen above the downtrend line.

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The ADA/USD pair could now rally to $0.38 and then to $0.40. If the bulls can drive the price above this resistance, the pair may rally to the resistance line of the channel near $0.46. The momentum could pick up if the bulls propel the price above the channel.

The gradually upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.32) and the RSI in the positive zone suggest bulls have the upper hand. This bullish move will be negated if the price turns down and plummets below the support line of the channel. If that happens, the pair could drop to the 50-day SMA ($0.24).

LINK/USD

The bulls flipped the previous resistance at $20.1111 into support when Chainlink (LINK) rebounded off it on Jan. 27. The buyers will now try to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above the all-time high at $25.7824.

LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If they succeed, the LINK/USD pair could rally to $30. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest the trend favors the bulls.

Contrary to this assumption, if the pair turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below $20.1111, it will suggest the sentiment has turned negative and traders are selling on rallies. That could pull the price down to $17.7777 and then to the 50-day SMA ($16).

LTC/USD

Litecoin (LTC) did not complete the bearish head and shoulders pattern on Jan. 27 as the bears could not sustain the price below the critical $120 support. The altcoin rebounded sharply on Jan. 28, suggesting strong demand at lower levels.

LTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The relief rally has reached the downtrend line, which may act as a resistance. If the price turns down from the downtrend line, the bears will again try to sink the price below the neckline of the H&S pattern at $120. If they succeed, a drop to $100 and then to $70 may be on the cards.

Conversely, if the bulls can drive the price above the downtrend line, it may result in a rally to $165.9709. The bears may attempt to defend this level but if the LTC/USD pair can climb above it, a retest of $185.5821 is possible.

The price action at the downtrend line is likely to decide whether the next move will favor the bulls or the bears.

BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) bounced off the $370 support on Jan. 28, which suggests the bulls are attempting to defend this level. The rebound is currently facing resistance at the 20-day EMA ($437).

BCH/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the price turns down from the current level and breaks below the 50-day SMA ($395), the bears will try to sink the price below the $370 to $353 support zone.

However, the 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is just below the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand.

If the bulls can sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USD pair may rise to $465 and then to $515 and extend its consolidation by a few more days.

BNB/USD

Binance Coin (BNB) bounced off the support line of the ascending broadening wedge pattern on Jan. 28, which shows strong demand at lower levels. The bulls continued their purchase today and pushed the price above the $43.4241 resistance but are struggling to hold on to the higher levels.

BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The gradually upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory suggest the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the bulls can sustain the price above $43.4341, the BNB/USD pair could retest the all-time high at $47.2187.

A breakout of this resistance will suggest the resumption of the uptrend with the next target objective at $50 and then $55. This bullish view will invalidate if the pair turns down from the current level and breaks below the support line.

XLM/USD

Stellar Lumens (XLM) broke below the $0.26 support on Jan. 27, but the bears could not capitalize on this weakness. This attracted aggressive buying from the bulls on Jan. 28, resulting in a sharp bounce that pushed the price back above $0.26.

XLM/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The buying continued today and the bulls propelled the price above the $0.35 resistance but they have not been able to sustain the higher levels as seen from the long wick on the day’s candlestick.

Aggressive buying at lower levels and selling at higher levels suggest the XLM/USD pair may remain range-bound for a few more days.

This view of a consolidation will invalidate if the bulls push and sustain the price above $0.35. Such a move will indicate the bulls have made a strong comeback. If they can push the price above $0.409, a rally to $0.50 is possible.

He also sees the possibility of Bitcoin dropping to $20,000 and Ethereum dropping to $500. This wide spread is derived from a philosophy he calls the DNA of volatility.

DNA of volatility

According to Holmes, each asset class has its own DNA of volatility, or the typical percentage of price fluctuation over a period of time. He finds it particularly intriguing when two different assets have similar volatilities. In this interview, he points out that the DNA of volatility of Tesla is the same as Ethereum.

The stock market, the S&P 500, is 1%. Gold is 1%. Gold stocks are 2%. But Tesla is 5%. Ethereum is 5%. Bitcoin is 5%.

So why do these two seemingly disconnected assets have similar DNAs of volatility? Holmes believes that a higher range of volatility is an indicator of a disruptive asset. Tesla is disrupting the car industry while cryptocurrencies are disrupting the global financial sector. Although these assets inhabit wholly different industries, they are both agents of change, which creates similar uncertainty and volatility in price.

Bitcoin will become art

The crypto space is famous for high-flying Bitcoin price predictions. Some, such as Dan Held, even believe Bitcoin could hit $1,000,000 per coin. But if Bitcoin were to reach even a third of that number, how would it happen?

""What will drive it to $400,000 valuations, I hear, is because it’s going to become art. It’s going to be classified as a collector’s item.""

Looking 3-4 years down the road, Holmes postulates that Bitcoin will still be valuable as art even if it doesn’t become the sovereign digital money it was originally built to be. He likens owning Bitcoin to having an original Andy Warhol print, except Bitcoin is far more transactable.

""It’s amazing...and there’s a limited supply!""

However, the boom also exposed a lot of vulnerabilities of the Ethereum network, which most DeFi projects are built upon. The most serious ones included high gas costs and low scalability.

A bull cycle has kicked in since then, lifting Ether’s (ETH) value to a new all-time high — and now the above-mentioned problems are even more persistent. People are forced to pay as much as $60 to $100 to complete a single trade on Uniswap, while numerous DeFi projects are struggling to facilitate their transactions on the Ethereum chain in time, failing their users as a result. An unending cycle of bullish news doesn’t help, as it unintentionally distracts the community from those problems. It has been two days, and your transaction is still pending? But look at the charts: Ether price has been exploding, and one of the institutional funds has announced it is buying X million Bitcoin (BTC)!

Are we really ready to keep paying a few tens of dollars to send a single transaction?

Luckily, the potential fix has already arrived. Layer-two solutions, which started to gain traction around crypto winter, serve to address both the issues at hand: They reduce gas fees and scale the Ethereum network by moving most transactions to sidechains. There are quite a few companies that have been working on such solutions, including Aztec, Offchain Labs, Matter Labs and others.

There are also projects like Polkadot, which uses a sharded multichain network that can process many transactions on smaller chains in parallel — which is why they are called “parachains” — instead of processing them one-by-one like legacy blockchains.

Similarly, Polkadot’s DOT token has been experiencing an unprecedented rally on the back of the rising gas fees, beating XRP and moving up to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. In its 2021 prediction, Maple Leaf Capital — a team of researchers focused on Web 3.0 speculation and building — anticipated that Polkadot could jumpstart infrastructure and application improvements.

As a result of the massive adoption of layer-two solutions, a lot of space will be created for the cryptocurrency industry — and we will heave a sigh of relief and get back to savoring the good news about cryptocurrency’s market capitalization, Bitcoin’s value and institutional adoption.

According to TradingView data, the ticker BTC1!, which represents CME’s Bitcoin futures contracts with the closest expiry — currently for February — is trading at over a 1% premium over spot BTC markets. This positive deviation in prices between a future and the underlying — which traders call ""contango"" — indicates that few institutions are willing to be short on the asset. Since this difference can be arbitraged, a consistent contango condition means that the buying pressure is overwhelming arbitrageurs, who cannot keep the price divergence in chec.

A one percent deviation on a contract expiring in one month is significant. It is normal for longer-dated contracts to have significant deviation, as the longer the wait, the less compelling the arbitrage opportunity becomes. The attractiveness of such an opportunity is compared to the “risk-free interest rate,” usually U.S. Treasury bonds. Current yield is just over 1% per annum, meaning that making 1% in a month should be more than lucrative.

Looking at the charts, it is clear that CME’s contract is trading at about $500 higher, a 1.3% difference. It is worth noting that TradingView delays CME data by ten minutes, meaning that the chart must be compared with previous candles on Bitstamp.

CME is a traditional futures exchange that offers contracts for 5 BTC each — outside of the reach of most retail traders. A contango condition on this platform is a strong indicator that traditional institutions are particularly bullish on Bitcoin.

Indeed, the institutional world has seen dramatic short squeezes lately, fueled by traders on Wall Street Bets, a Reddit forum. Stocks like GameStop, AMC and Nokia are seeing immense rallies as the community rallied behind assets with huge short positions opened by hedge funds.

Nonetheless, excessive premiums on futures contracts are usually interpreted as signs of exhaustion.

Matt Casto, an analyst at CMT Digital, tweeted a compilation of 410 crypto assets that hit their all-time high in 2017 or later, which showed an average loss of 65.71% for all the projects combined.

Out of the 410 assets analyzed, 157 hit their all-time high in 2018, having lost since then an average of 90.71% in value. A further 67 assets hit their all-time high in 2019 and have since lost 73.33%. In contrast, projects that have hit their all-time high in 2021 have only shed 13.82% of their value.

According to Casto, holding assets that have hit their all-time high in the last three years is “a massive lost opportunity cost for deploying capital.” The data illustrates how the market favors hype cycles and speculates on coins that often have little to add to the cryptosphere as a whole.

While the current crypto rally has also been reflected in many of these coins, they are still far from their all-time high, as the data shows. In the meantime, tokens in the DeFi ecosystem have been breaking their all-time highs continuously, showing that for many of these coins, their best days are yet to come and that it’s happening at the expense of the zombies.

The great repricing

While Bitcoin (BTC), the oldest cryptocurrency, has continued to show gains throughout the years, most other “old” coins have not shown the same tendency. Data from Messari further confirms the concept of the “great repricing,” which states that many of the top altcoins in the market will be replaced by newer sectors such as decentralized finance.

When asked about the great repricing, Ryan Watkins, senior research analyst at Messari, told Cointelegraph that it’s “definitely not just hype” but rather “real fundamentals, high growth, strong product-market fit.”

These once-prevalent altcoins are becoming known as “zombie projects” and are usually layer-one blockchain protocols, many of which compete directly with Bitcoin and Ethereum, either as a form of currency or platforms for asset issuance, smart contracts and more. With both BTC and Ether (ETH) maintaining their relevancy, many of these projects are now generally seen as being obsolete or having failed.

As for DeFi, the ability to generate yield from cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, along with the possibilities for decentralized and superior financial services, makes it one of the most interesting (and risky) investment choices of 2021. As such, capital that once flowed into these assets during the alt season of 2017 and 2018 is now being redirected to the promising DeFi sector, most of which is hosted on the Ethereum network.

Why do projects become irrelevant?

While many of the aforementioned zombie projects started out with potential, they were often launched with a single feature or purpose in mind: coins that focused on privacy or speed or projects providing a specific service such as file-sharing or asset issuance.

However, as Ethereum continues to be the go-to place for developers to create new functionalities in crypto, many of these features or purposes have been incorporated within the Ethereum ecosystem itself, making many layer-one projects obsolete. The same can be said for Bitcoin, whose developers continue to strive to make faster and anonymous payments a reality through projects such as the Lightning Network and more.

Throughout the years, Ethereum has garnered what is known as the “network effect,” where all the services required by users are found in one place. Therefore, it’s more convenient to stay inside a single network and to use only one cryptocurrency to pay for these services, the most popular of which has become DeFi’s yield-generating protocols, such as Yearn.finance and Compound.

It’s also worth noting that many of the coins that hit their all-time high in 2018 were competitors to Bitcoin and Ethereum. The two top cryptocurrencies have turned out to be resistant to the test of time. Bitcoin’s superior safety has proven itself in comparison to competitors that have been victims to 51% attacks on the networks.

On the other hand, the hype generated around initial coin offerings also had a huge role in making these projects relevant, to begin with, as the cryptocurrency bubble of 2017 and 2018 pushed the prices of these tokens to unrealistic levels.

Once the hype is gone, the crypto community seems to have lost the appetite for these projects, while some have been all but forgotten. Ilya Abugov, advisor at DApp statistics aggregator DappRadar, told Cointelegraph: “Startups fail at a very high rate, so it is only natural that many of the projects from the 2018 wave will not recover.”

Why are zombie projects still going?

Despite being far from their all-time high, a small number of these projects has shown gains during the current bull market, some of which have shown four-figure percentage gains.

Many projects are kept going by their community of investors who believe in long-term success. Some of these have made strides in some features or shown success in the DeFi realm.

However, it’s hard to say if this will last, especially as Ethereum continues to dominate the DeFi sector. According to Abugov, this may soon change since “it takes time for useful DApps to emerge on a platform. Ethereum had a head start.” He added further:

“It wouldn’t be surprising if some of the challengers start to show some meaningful activity this year. Market cap rankings don’t show developer activity. For some chains, the market may be trying to price in prospects of future growth.”

Is DeFi here to stay?

As the top altcoins from yesteryear fade out of the spotlight, the DeFi sector continues to take the world by storm with projects such as Aave, Uniswap and SushiSwap being among the top gainers in January, rising over 200% in the last 30 days. Isa Kivlighan, digital marketing manager at Aave, told Cointelegraph that “DeFi is just getting started,” adding:

“After recent trends in the TradFi space, people are calling for permissionless finance with none of the traditional exclusionary ‘gatekeepers.’ DeFi is becoming more accessible to the mainstream every day.”

The initial DeFi boom in the first quarter of 2020 counted with a lot of overhyped projects, some scams, rug pulls and hacks, and some compared it to the ICO craze of 2017–2018 when worthless projects were pumped for no apparent reason other than pure speculation.

Although hype is still part of the current scenario, the second surge of DeFi seems to favor promising projects with an already-working product, with pre-DeFi projects still lagging behind, as Dr. Octavius, co-founder of DeFi protocol OctoFi, told Cointelegraph:

“A vast majority of the most active market participants weathered the storm and are now well equipped with a crypto quiver. Their due diligence extends beyond skimming a white paper, and that’s because there are real products now. Nothing beats getting your hands dirty and taking something apart to see how it works. Or simply pressing the wrong button and seeing it blow up in your face.”

Meanwhile, new sectors of the cryptosphere have been gaining traction, especially nonfungible tokens. These types of tokens allow nonfungible assets, virtual or physical, to be represented in a digital setting, facilitating proof of ownership, transactions and sales. NFTs are often used to represent in-game items, digital artwork and more.

Related: The perfect match? Both Bitcoin and DeFi push and pull crypto markets

While NFTs may become increasingly popular in the future, there seems to be a synergy between them and decentralized finance, where DeFi concepts, such as decentralized trading, can be applied to the NFT sector, and NFTs can be used to gamify DeFi apps, among other examples. Abugov believes that DeFi is here to stay, despite the growth of other sectors in crypto. He told Cointelegraph:

“DeFi is a sector, and it’s not going away, just like L1 infrastructure didn’t go away because a lot of L1 projects haven’t been successful. The competitive landscape may change, but DeFi provides vital utilities to the market, so it is here to stay.”","['market', 'newcomers', 'original', 'projects', 'crypto', 'high', 'ground', 'altcoins', 'alltime', 'ethereum', 'assets', 'lose', 'hit', 'coins', 'defi', 'welcome', 'zombies']","Data by crypto analytics firm Messari shows that many of the projects once favored by the market are still far from their all-time high.

However, this correction might have ended as a significant momentum shift occurred in recent days.

The GameStop debacle raised many questions about big parties' trustworthiness and exchanges, after which more and more people started to claim that decentralization is the future.

Among these people is Elon Musk who is worth nearly $183 billion, according to Forbes making him the world's richest person. The Tesla CEO included #Bitcoin in his Twitter profile and also wrote ""in retrospect, it was inevitable."" A very cryptic message to his 44 million followers, which some may interpret as Musk investing in Bitcoin.

In retrospect, it was inevitable — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 29, 2021

However, this tweet and profile change from Elon Musk prompted a new rally on Jan. 29 with price surging from $32,500 to $38,000 in a matter of minutes. The primary questions now are: does this mean the bull market is continuing and will BTC see new all-time highs?

Bitcoin holds key $30,000 level

The 2-hour chart shows a clear bullish breakout after holding the significant support zone at $30,000.

The critical breaker for bullish continuation was to find support at $30,000, which happened in recent days. Since then, the next step for bullish continuation would be a breakout above the $34,000 resistance zone.

As the chart shows, and largely thanks to Elon Musk's tweet, the breakout was confirmed, and Bitcoin started to accelerate heavily. The next level to break is $37,600-38,000 as that’s the next area of significant liquidity.

Currently, Bitcoin’s price is trying to crack that level of resistance at $38,000. If this area flips for support, a further bullish continuation toward the all-time highs will likely occur, and $50,000 comes into play.

Total market cap makes a new all-time high

Total cryptocurrency market cap 1-week candle chart. Source: TradingView

The total cryptocurrency market capitalization has reached new all-time highs in the past 24 hours, accelerating to the $1.13 billion level.

However, the total market capitalization and the price of Bitcoin are still far away from the 21-Week MA. That 21-Week MA often sees a support test before continuing upward.

Therefore, the levels to watch for the total market cap are still the same as before. If the market can’t continue going up from here, $730 billion will be the focus as that would grant a perfect support/resistance flip from the previous all-time high.

The weekly chart shows an apparent bullish cycle and a big gap between the 21-Week MA and the current price. These two often come back to each other to get the markets back to the ""mean"" of the price movement.

Thus, such a correction would bring the price of Bitcoin to the $25,000 region in the coming weeks. In the end, as long as Bitcoin remains above the 21-Week MA, the continuation of this bull market is very likely.

Critical levels to watch for Bitcoin

Currently, the price of Bitcoin is trying to break through the resistance at $38,000. If that breaks, a continuation toward a new all-time highs seems inevitable, as $40,500 is the only level to watch after $38,000.

In that perspective, even price targets of $45,000 and $50,000 are on the table. However, if Bitcoin’s price can’t break through the $38,000 area, a renewed retest of the $34,000 zone should be expected.

If that doesn’t hold for support, a sharp fall toward the lows may occur along with more range-bound price action. Nevertheless, this would not be unhealthy for the market from a wider perspective.

Dalio’s views on Bitcoin (BTC) — which he said should be read directly to avoid media misinterpretation — are both hopeful and cautious. Firstly, Dalio recognized the technical accomplishments of Bitcoin and praised its ability to last for over a decade already:

“I believe Bitcoin is one hell of an invention. To have invented a new type of money via a system that is programmed into a computer and that has worked for around 10 years and is rapidly gaining popularity as both a type of money and a storehold of wealth is an amazing accomplishment.”

What’s more, Dalio believes that Bitcoin is already an “alternative gold-like asset,” and one that will become more and more important in the future due to the debasement of fiat currencies by excessive money and debt printing:

“Those who have built it and supported the dream of making this new kind of money a reality have done a fabulous job of sustaining that dream and moving Bitcoin (by which I mean it and its analogous competitors) into being an alternative gold-like asset. There aren’t many alternative gold-like assets at this time of rising need for them (because of all the debt and money creations that are underway and will happen in the future).""

Dalio thinks Bitcoin has already crossed the line from being a “speculative idea” to something that will “probably” have some value in time to come:

“It seems to me that Bitcoin has succeeded in crossing the line from being a highly speculative idea that could well not be around in short order to probably being around and probably having some value in the future.""

However, not everything is rosy regarding Dalio’s thoughts on the world’s first cryptocurrency. The hedge fund manager thinks the extent of Bitcoin’s privacy will depend entirely on how private the government allows it to be:

“As an extension of Bitcoin being digital are the questions of how private it is and what the government will allow and not allow it to be. Regarding privacy, it appears that Bitcoin will unlikely be as private as some people surmise. It is, after all, a public ledger…”

Why would governments want to disrupt the use of Bitcoin? As Dalio points out, the principles at play now are the exact same as those at play in the year 1694, when the newly launched Bank of England sought to solidify its position as the sole issuer of debt and monies within its borders.

Leaders in any industry will naturally try to quash opposition, and the same might happen with Bitcoin, especially, as Dalio points out, if it ends up becoming more and more popular.

“Rather than it being far-fetched that the government would invade the privacy and/or prevent the use of Bitcoin (and its competitors) it seems to me that the more successful it is the more likely these possibilities would be.”

Dalio does not think government agencies will allow Bitcoin to flourish as an alternative to printed money — a sobering thought which pours some icy water on his earlier praise of the technology. Dalio said:

“It is hard for me to imagine that they would allow Bitcoin (or gold) to be an obviously better choice than the money and credit that they are producing. I suspect that Bitcoin’s biggest risk is being successful, because if it’s successful, the government will try to kill it and they have a lot of power to succeed.”

The alleged demand which Bitcoin is credited with having as a result of its diminishing supply was also questioned by Dalio, who pointed out that the emergence of “Bitcoin-like” assets (other altcoins) effectively expanded Bitcoin’s supply by offering an alternative but similar service.

Putting thoughts and theories to one side, Dalio also asked his staff at Bridgewater Associates to calculate the efficiency of Bitcoin as a diversified asset in relation to gold during market drawdowns.

The researchers concluded that it was still too early to judge whether Bitcoin would provide the same degree of diversification in the future.

“We hesitate to draw any firm conclusions with such a small sample size and given how quickly the cryptocurrency world is evolving. So far, Bitcoin’s ability to offer some diversification benefit seems more theoretical than realized,” the report stated.","['bitcoins', 'private', 'probably', 'wont', 'goldlike', 'let', 'alternative', 'dalio', 'successful', 'bitcoin', 'governments', 'ray', 'allow', 'money', 'asset', 'win']","Billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio has sought to clarify his views on the world’s most famous digital asset with the publication of a short essay titled “What I Really Think of Bitcoin”.
Dalio’s views on Bitcoin (BTC) — which he said should be read directly to avoid media misinterpretation — are both hopeful and cautious.
Firstly, Dalio recognized the technical accomplishments of Bitcoin and praised its ability to last for over a decade already:“I believe Bitcoin is one hell of an invention.
It is, after all, a public ledger…”Why would governments want to disrupt the use of Bitcoin?

Cartesi’s design uses a slightly modified version of Optimistic Rollups, a layer-two technology developed within the Ethereum ecosystem, to power its virtual machine. In contrast with Optimism’s implementation, which uses this type of rollups primarily to maintain full compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts, Cartesi wants to offer a traditional development environment.

The Cartesi virtual machine emulates a RISC-V microprocessor architecture, an open-source alternative to the ARM instruction set commonly used in smartphones or Apple’s M1-based computers. The RISC-V architecture allows running standard software environments based on Linux. For developers building on Cartesi, this means that smart contracts can be developed in virtually any language and development ecosystem, provided it is supported by Linux.

The rollup-based design allows Cartesi to connect such a complex environment to the blockchain, piggybacking on its security model to ensure the validity of what happens on layer-two. The premise of a rollup is that all changes to the state of an external environment, for example wallet balances and exchange transactions, are eventually published in compressed form to the main layer one blockchain, for example Ethereum.

Optimistic rollups rely on publishing the data on the blockchain and allowing a challenge period. During this time, users can submit “fraud proofs” to signal that the data is incorrect, triggering a dispute that should result in a correction of that data. Once resolved, the state is finalized and guaranteed to be valid through the blockchain’s security model. The long withdrawal period is nonetheless a common point of criticism.

Cartesi’s version of Optimistic Rollups uses so-called interactive dispute resolutions to allow the blockchain itself to compute the correct version of the data with minimal cost. Erick de Moura, founder of Cartesi, told Cointelegraph that this design is what allows running much more complex computations than what is offered by the Ethereum virtual machine:

“Other rollups solutions are only making Solidity code perform better on layer-2. We are, however, creating something that is much closer to a real decentralized computer with a real operating system.”

De Moura also stressed that Cartesi’s design is blockchain-agnostic, and works on other blockchains like Binance Smart Chain or Matic — with more integrations to be developed in the future as well.

It remains to be seen if Cartesi’s proposition will find traction. Amid virtually all smart contract platforms adopting Solidity, the project is going against the grain. Nonetheless, the Linux-based environment could be attractive for those building much more complex DApps.","['cartesi', 'design', 'linuxbased', 'decentralized', 'build', 'blockchain', 'version', 'data', 'uses', 'smart', 'computer', 'machine', 'virtual', 'project', 'rollups']","Layer-two project Cartesi has unveiled a rollup-centric design for its Cartesi Machine, a Linux-based virtual machine that would allow developers to run any type of computing application secured via blockchains.

Ohanian’s bio update seemed to be in response to a tweet by tech entrepreneur and former Coinbase chief technology officer Balaji Srinivasan. As part of the tweet, Srinivasan highlighted the growing appeal of Bitcoin to the likes of Musk and Dorsey, calling Bitcoin (BTC) “the flag of technology.”

The Reddit co-founder is a known crypto advocate and has previously revealed that he holds a percentage of his wealth in cryptocurrency. Back in May 2020, Ohanian remarked that crypto was here to stay and praised the level of “top-tier talent building” in the industry.

Ohanian has previously offered optimistic price predictions for both Bitcoin and Ether (ETH) at $20,000 and $1,500, respectively. At the time, the Reddit co-founder revealed that he was most bullish about Ethereum.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Reddit, with its over 1.7 billion monthly visitors, recently inked a partnership deal with the Ethereum Foundation. As part of the collaboration, Reddit plans to introduce the requisite scaling technology to support projects like tokenized community points on the Ethereum network.

Musk’s bio update earlier on Friday seemed to spark a flurry of BTC buying action, with Bitcoin briefly surpassing $38,000 for the first time in almost two weeks. The current resurgence in BTC enthusiasm also appears fuelled by the actions of several in the mainstream trading establishment and their treatment of retail participants.

On Thursday, several retail brokers like Robinhood prevented users from buying stocks like GameStop and AMC. These stocks had been experiencing parabolic gains to the benefit of retail holders, with the resultant short squeeze threatening to bankrupt prominent hedge funds.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s Friday surge has seen over $850 million in BTC derivatives, mostly shorts, liquidated over the last 24-hour trading period. According to Bybt data, more than 310,000 trader positions went underwater, with the largest single liquidation happening on BitMEX to the tune of about $10 million.","['retail', 'amid', 'cofounder', 'hoists', 'surge', 'technology', 'twitter', 'bitcoin', 'price', 'btc', 'update', 'flag', 'previously', 'reddit', 'trading']","Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian has joined Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and Tesla CEO Elon Musk in updating their Twitter bios to ""#Bitcoin.""

Gabriel Makhlouf, who is also a governing council member of the European Central Bank, warned the public about the risks of crypto investment on Bloomberg TV this Friday. The central banker specifically referred to a recent warning by the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority on Jan. 11:

“As the U.K. authority said a few weeks ago [...] if people want to invest in Bitcoin they've got to be prepared to lose all their money. That's certainly my view.“

According to Makhlouf, consumer protection is now the most important task of local regulators as investors are clearly considering cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as assets for investment. Despite growing concerns about consumer protection, Makhlouf appeared to be confident that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin do not pose a threat to global financial stability:

“Personally, I’m not sure why people invest in those sorts of assets, but they see them as assets clearly, and they see them as investments. Our role is to make sure that consumers are protected. I see that as the main role, I don’t see financial stability issues at the moment arising from Bitcoin itself. I worry more about consumers making the right choices.”

Some key crypto community members have taken issue with Makhlouf's statements. Founder and CEO of Galaxy Digital Mike Novogratz argued that unlevered Bitcoin investment is not as risky as the central banker implied.

I am sick of this type commentary. It’s just not true. Yes it’s a 100% vol asset and if you buy with leverage it’s very risky. But unlevered you will NOT lose all your money. $BTC is a macro asset.

Makhlouf’s remarks echo those of European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, who on Jan. 13 called on global regulators to tighten rules for crypto, calling Bitcoin “funny business.”

This is a first for Dogecoin, and it happened as the price of DOGE surged around eightfold overnight from $0.012 to over $0.08.

What was behind the craze around DOGE?

The meteoric rally of DOGE was fueled by posts and tweets from r/Wallstreetbets traders on Twitter and Reddit. In fact, the tweet volume also soared to new record highs, surpassing BTC for the first time ever.

The craze around GameStop (GME) moved over to silver and DOGE as a result, causing massive rallies in a short period.

The suspension of the trading of GME on Robinhood also catalyzed the DOGE rally, industry executives say.

On Jan. 29, Robinhood abruptly halted the trading of GME, causing outrage among its users and several lawmakers.

Some theorize that the trading halt enraged many users and led them to turn their eyes to other assets. Among other assets, many traders in the r/Wallstreetbets community were attracted by DOGE and silver.

Mike Abundo, tcommittee chairman at Fintech Philippines, said:

“If you had just remembered that $DOGE was always the most popular memecoin on Robinhood, and figured out that Robinhooders blocked from memestocks would go for a memecoin instead, you might be fantastically wealthy by now.”

Almost immediately after DOGE saw its rally, Bitcoin saw a sudden surge as Elon Musk, the world's richest man, added “Bitcoin” to his Twitter bio.

While Bitcoin most likely rallied due to Musk’s unexpected addition of the word “Bitcoin” to his bio, some of the profits from DOGE could have also flown back into BTC to propel its price.

While some may think that DOGE is too small to affect the price of a major cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, it briefly became the eighth-largest cryptocurrency in the world.

With over $5 billion in daily volume, there is sufficient capital in DOGE trading that it could have a significant impact on the short-term price trend of Bitcoin.

What happens to DOGE next?

Some pseudonymous traders and analysts believe DOGE could have one more run up toward $0.01.

There is also an ongoing meme on r/Wallstreetbets and other related forums about pushing DOGE to $1. A trader known as “0x_Infinitum” said:

“IMO $Doge still has one more push. A big one. Just big enough for people to actually start believing the $1 meme. That's when lifelong community members will be made.”

Although DOGE is considered a “memecoin,” its recent rally pushed its valuation to over $7 billion. If DOGE rallies toward $1, it would make it the second-biggest cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin.

It already briefly overtook Litecoin (LTC) earlier today as its parabolic trend continued. At the time of writing, DOGE price is up roughly 340% in the past 24 hours","['bitcoins', 'doge', 'volume', 'dogecoin', 'hits', 'traders', 'surpassing', 'rwallstreetbets', 'robinhood', 'rally', 'bitcoin', 'memecoin', '5b', 'price', 'trading']","Dogecoin (DOGE) briefly surpassed Bitcoin (BTC) in daily volume on Binance at over $5 billion on Jan. 29.

Grants don’t always involve members of the community — and in some cases, the process can be rather opaque.

In an article a few months ago, Lane Rettig said: “I have yet to see a well-run grants program in the blockchain space.”

Given how extensively grants are used across the industry, this is a rather damning indictment. Rettig argued that these schemes tend to be incredibly centralized. Not only does an organization end up setting the agenda for development, but in many cases, founders end up giving large grants to people they already know. He pointed to the Ethereum Foundation as an example, noting: “Some of the largest grants have been awarded to projects led by individuals who are close friends of Vitalik Buterin.”

Grants struggle to deliver “permissionless innovation,” Rettig said, which he described as “the superpower of blockchain.” This is what enables a teenager to start mining crypto from their laptop at home, without needing a credit card or to go through Know Your Customer checks.

Ultimately, the main risk associated with grants is that they can be offputting to people who have bright ideas but are daunted by filling out an application form. Cutting-edge concepts can end up being shut out and disregarded because they don’t fit into the rigid parameters of a grant program. Allegations of nepotism and unfairness can begin swirling around — and worse still, community members may feel that they don’t have a say in the future direction of the ecosystem.","['better', 'healthy', 'grants', 'crypto', 'dont', 'know', 'community', 'rettig', 'members', 'end', 'cases', 'program', 'contests']","What are the downsides of crypto grants?

Right now, staking ETH is a significant, long-term commitment.

The minimum amount that someone was able to contribute into the deposit contract was 32 ETH — and at one point in November, that was worth an eye-watering $19,877.

These funds are going to be locked until the current mainnet “docks” with the beacon chain. At present, estimates suggest that this milestone may only be reached in 2022, meaning that aspiring validators may have to wait some time until they get their funds back.

One of the biggest downsides with the transition to Eth2 is how this takes a lot of commitment from the thousands of validators who have put their crypto where their mouths are. It’s a leap of faith — not least because several other key milestones related to this project have been hit behind schedule. Should further complications arise, there’s a chance that it could be years before the deposited ETH is released from the one-way contract, and its cash value may have fallen by then.

Serving as a validator also comes with responsibilities… and risks. “Slashing” means that nodes can be penalized for failing to act in the network’s best interests — as a result, there’s a real risk that staking could cause someone to lose crypto instead of earn it. Accidentally waving through an invalid transaction or falling offline can have huge consequences.","['worth', 'validators', 'crypto', 'explained', 'staking', 'theres', 'eth2', 'eth', 'beacon', 'challenges', 'downsides', 'funds', 'contract']","Right now, staking ETH is a significant, long-term commitment.

In the volatile world of cryptocurrency, latency becomes even more important than ever before, as prices can move swiftly in a matter of seconds. Furthermore, extremely low latency will be essential in bringing institutional money into these platforms.

The digital nature of cryptocurrency, not to mention the hype and uncertainty that surrounds the majority of the space, can lead to substantial volatility in crypto markets. Only a few seconds can make a huge difference in how successful a strategy is. More than ever, traders need to know that their trades are being posted as quickly as possible.

Another latency issue that users encounter on cryptocurrency exchanges comes from a lack of standards or uniformity. One exchange may have great infrastructure and speed, while others are lagging behind. This can cause headaches, as many traders interact with multiple platforms, especially arbitrage traders who seek to make a profit from price discrepancies across different markets. These opportunities don’t last long, and having low latency is essential to be able to capitalize on them.

These issues with performance don’t only affect individual human traders. The cryptocurrency space is currently being broken into by institutional investors, and if this trend is going to continue, there needs to be platforms that can cater to high-end customers. Institutions are already expecting the best and fastest services, and only platforms that offer this will be able to attract their business.

This is partly because of a trading technique that is now becoming widely used in the world of digital assets, known as algorithmic trading. Here, trades are made by computers that have been programmed to follow specific strategies. With humans, speed was already essential for being ahead of the competition, but automated trades have pushed this to the extreme and given rise to what is known as high-frequency trading, or HFT.","['latency', 'explained', 'world', 'exchanges', 'important', 'low', 'trades', 'speed', 'space', 'cryptocurrency', 'essential', 'traders', 'platforms', 'trading']","In the volatile world of cryptocurrency, latency becomes even more important than ever before, as prices can move swiftly in a matter of seconds.

While bots can be a great tool for many traders, some are concerned about the ways this could create room for manipulation, such as with “pump and dump” scams as well as decentralized exchange (DEX) manipulation.

Bots can manipulate exchanges

Using a series of bots to bring added liquidity to an exchange sounds harmless enough at first, as it should simply create a better user experience for clients. However, if the vast majority of trading activity on an exchange is bots, then that could be a red-flag that something isn’t right. Using bots to simulate real trading activity in order to make an exchange look more active is known as “wash trading” or “slippage.” It is illegal in traditional markets, but much of the cryptocurrency landscape is still unregulated, so it certainly happens. It has even been speculated that as much as 95% of cryptocurrency volume on some exchanges could be suspect.

There have also been issues with automation on decentralized exchanges, though not just with wash trading. It has been observed that HFT bots have been “front-running” on various DEX’s, a practice where the programs place incrementally higher fees to ensure their trades are given priority. By using an automated, lightning fast system, it becomes impossible for any human player to compete.

Pump and dump scams are common

Another way bots may be hurting cryptocurrency comes in the form of what are known as “pump and dump” scams. Using bots, the scammers basically make it look like one coin or another is beginning a bull run. This doesn’t necessarily have to be that far of aprice move either, as usually these scams occur to small cap coins that haven’t moved much in a while. When regular traders see that the price has risen a bit, it often starts to induce a certain level of FOMO that can then pretty much feed off of itself. Frequently the perpetrators combine this artificial pump with some form of social media campaign as well, to really get people excited. Once the coin has seen sufficient rise, the originators sell and let the market inevitably collapse sooner or later, as the “bull run” was never built on anything but hype and market manipulation.

In a similar vein, “flash crashes” are also an issue. This is when a sudden drop in price can trigger a whole series of bots, further pushing down the selloff, triggering more bots, and this can then create a cascade effect. In May of 2010 an event just like this took place in the stock market, seeing the Dow drop 1,000 points in mere minutes. Ultimately, it was just this sort of runaway automated effect that was found to be the culprit. Not only is cryptocurrency susceptible to this, the previously mentioned fact that it is a much smaller market makes it even more of a likelihood.

Institutions can get unfair advantages

Lastly, there are massive institutional players who also leverage the power of automated trading, but often have an advantage over retail users thanks to something called colocation. Colocation is a service offered by some large firms that allows businesses to rent and host servers at the same site as the exchange with direct connections to the trading systems. This means these clients have the absolute fastest ability to post orders, completely outclassing those without the service. Of course, these accounts can be quite pricey, which can leave many retail investors well behind.","['market', 'crypto', 'dump', 'explained', 'exchange', 'influences', 'pump', 'scams', 'bot', 'using', 'create', 'bots', 'cryptocurrency', 'trading']","However, if the vast majority of trading activity on an exchange is bots, then that could be a red-flag that something isn’t right.

Decentralized exchanges where one trades with a smart contract, not other people

Automated market makers, or AMMs, are a class of decentralized exchanges that rely on mathematical formulas to set the price of a token. Like normal exchanges, they have various trading pairs: for example, Ether (ETH) to Dai.

But there are no buy or sell orders, and traders don’t need to find someone else to sell their coins to. Instead, a smart contract acts as the maker in an exchange transaction. The concept is similar to quick-swap services like ShapeShift and Changelly, but the difference is that the company’s reserves are replaced with liquidity pools based on smart contracts.

A liquidity pool contains two assets in a trading pair. The relative percentage of each token in that pool is what determines the theoretical price of a particular asset. The first live AMM was Bancor, launched in 2017, but the most popular platforms today are Uniswap, Curve, Kyber and Balancer.","['automated', 'makers', 'market', 'contract', 'explained', 'exchanges', 'token', 'pool', 'smart', 'price', 'uniswap', 'sell', 'trading', 'liquidity']","What are automated market makers?
Decentralized exchanges where one trades with a smart contract, not other peopleAutomated market makers, or AMMs, are a class of decentralized exchanges that rely on mathematical formulas to set the price of a token.
Instead, a smart contract acts as the maker in an exchange transaction.

A cross-disciplinary research effort from Cointelegraph Consulting and VeChain provides the answers. This report was the result of a three-month long study, led by the Cointelegraph Consulting research team together with enterprise blockchain professionals from VeChain. In this report, we go beyond utilizing secondary data only — as we are ready to share some unique insights on the future of food safety. Despite the measures taken, the scale of the food safety problem grows globally, costing both developed and emerging economies lives and billions of dollars in losses every year. The report summarized that the lack of 3 key factors — transparency, trust and collaboration within the industry — are the main reason for exacerbation of the problem.

Major food safety incidents happen nearly every year and aren’t limited to underdeveloped countries 2008 — Milk scandal, China

2009 — Peanut butter scandal, USA

2010 — Contaminated green beans scandal, China

2011 — Listeriosis outbreak, USA

2012 — Salmonella outbreak, Netherlands

2013 — Horsemeat scandal, Europe

2014 — McDonald's meat scandal, Asia

2015 — Rotten frozen meat, China

2016 — Chipotle foodborne illness, USA

2017 — Fipronil egg scandal, Europe and Asia

2018 — Listeria outbreak, Australia

2019 — Salmonella-infected chickens, Brasi

The scale of food safety problems has grown: firstly, the number of countries affected by each incident goes up, secondly, the total losses from scandals that occurred in 2014 – 2019 exceed the losses in the five years preceding that.

Five areas in the food industry will see tremendous changes in the upcoming decade due to IoT and blockchain adoption: stakeholder mindset, food production, food processing, supply chain and global trade. This report also estimated that implementing joint IoT and blockchain solutions for the food supply chain could change the industry from the inside, resulting in $155 billion per year in potential savings.
