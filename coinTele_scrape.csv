Despite BTC price action failing to deliver a convincing continuation of its bull run in recent weeks, anticipation is building that the status quo will soon be turned on its head. As Cointelegraph reported, asset management giant Grayscale may provide the spark that reignites the market as soon as Wednesday.

Dubbed Gemini Earn, the program lets customers earn up to 7.4% annual interest on all cryptocurrencies supported by Gemini, the firm announced Tuesday. The platform supports 26 cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Zcash (ZEC) and others. The program is immediately available for select Gemini customers, while a full-scale rollout is scheduled for early February.

Gemini chief operating officer Noah Perlman told Cointelegraph that interest rates for each cryptocurrency are based on supply and demand in the market for borrowing that crypto. Interest is compounded and paid daily, with earnings being generated in the same cryptocurrency as the deposited funds.

Gemini Earn will be run as part of the Gemini platform, enabling customers to transfer existing crypto holdings or purchase crypto to send to Gemini Earn. The program allows users to earn interest for any period of time, requiring no minimum balance.

As a Trust company regulated by the New York Department of Finance, Gemini positions its new product as the only crypto interest-earning program available in all 50 states. As Gemini is not the lender or borrower, the firm’s partners like Genesis Global Capital are crucial in providing this product, Perlman noted. “Our vetted institutional lending partners, such as Genesis Global Capital, find these borrowers and lend crypto funds in exchange for an interest payment,” he said.

Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss said, “We designed a program that allows our customers the ability to generate a real return on their crypto holdings without having to sell one of the best performing asset classes of the decade.”

The launch of Gemini Earn comes shortly after the exchange released its new credit card in mid-January 2021, which allows users to earn crypto rewards on everyday purchases in crypto.

According to Fox Business Network’s Charles Gasparino, sources inside Robinhood say the company’s only focus is surviving the fallout from the drama it currently finds itself engulfed in, and will pause its plans for an IPO launch for now.

Execs say they have access to even more capital than additional amounts raised today. More @TeamCavuto 1230pm — Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) February 1, 2021

As reported by Techcrunch, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev was quizzed by none other than Elon Musk on invite-only app Clubhouse, where Tenev revealed the extent of the firm’s losses.

According to Tenev, he woke up early on Jan. 28 to find a bill from the National Securities Clearing Corporation for the sum of $3 billion, payable immediately. Providing context for that number, Tenev said:

“Robinhood up until that point has raised around $2 billion in total venture capital. Up until now, so it’s a big number, like $3 billion is a large number, right.”

The Wall Street Journal reported on Feb. 1 that Robinhood had raised another $2.4 billion from investors, taking the total sum of money raised since last Thursday to $3.4 billion. Yet despite apparently having no problems with liquidity, the firm appears to have reasoned that its current public perception would not be conducive to a successful IPO.

Indeed, a vast majority of surveyed professionals believe that Robinhood has ruined its chances of launching an IPO due to its behavior during the recent GameStop saga.

An anonymous survey conducted via the Blind networking forum asked 8,750 verified professionals from major tech and financial services companies if they thought Robinhood had “screwed its IPO”. The results revealed that 83% thought the firm’s chances of a successful initial public offering had been irreparably damaged.

The response given by 37 Robinhood employees surveyed was markedly different. Just 13.5% believe the company has killed the possibility of ever seeing a successful IPO launch, while 86.5% believe it can still go ahead.

A self-effacing comment from a Facebook employee expressed the view that the IPO could still go ahead, but that Robinhood would forever suffer the same negative public opinion as the ubiquitous social media giant. They wrote:

“Robinhood is the next Facebook. Something tons of people will use but has a negative undertone and brand.”

Public opinion soured on Robinhood following the company’s decision to ban retail buy orders in the middle of the Reddit-inspired “short squeeze” on GameStop. Sharp-eyed observers were quick to point out the possible conflict of interest at play given 35% of Robinhood’s revenue came from the same firm which suffered heavy losses at the hands of r/Wallstreetbets organized band of collective traders.

Robinhood has since stated that the only reason it halted retail buy orders was because it couldn’t cover its commitments to the NSCC, which demands that each day’s trading liabilities are covered in full.

The company was contacted for comment, but had not replied by time of publication.","['wake', 'opinion', 'plans', 'raised', 'trading', 'reportedly', 'ipo', 'pr', 'public', 'billion', 'successful', 'tenev', 'gamestop', 'shelves', 'robinhood', 'disaster']","Trading app Robinhood may have put its plans for an initial public offering on hold after public opinion turned against the company in the wake of its response to the short squeeze on GameStop (GME).

According to data from on-chain analytics resource CryptoQuant, the price premium of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) just hit its lowest since April 2019.

Grayscale lock-up ends Wednesday

Grayscale has made the headlines frequently this year thanks to record BTC purchases and record demand, but despite the inflows, BTC/USD has not continued to gain.

As February begins, the Trust’s purchase premium is at around $6.50, having previously been as high as $40 over the course of its existence. This historically coincides with meandering price direction, while large premiums equal large upside moves for Bitcoin.

In late December, a dedicated article in technology magazine Hackernoon explained the phenomenon as being tied to releases of GBTC shares which have been subject to a customary lock-up.

Once they are released, Bitcoin tends to shoot higher as customers put their profits back into BTC, while the time preceding such events corresponds to a lack of price action.

“What's important to know is once these higher prices and premiums are realized after an unlocking, price goes on to consolidate. This lets the premium shrink again before its next unlocking event,” Hackernoon summarized.

With the next unlocking set for Feb. 3, anticipation should be building for a continuation of the Bitcoin bull run.

“This voids enables premiums to shrink again just like the nine times before,” the article continued, correctly predicting the price behavior for the second half of January.

“And it'll keep shrinking until the next unlocking. Because of this I expect price to either consolidate or sag.”

Grayscale meanwhile continues to expand its offerings as institutional interest broadly shows no signs of slowing for either Bitcoin or altcoins.

XRP’s legal woes may place a damper on the rally

In the past few months, XRP price has been hard hit due to a lawsuit filed against Ripple by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC alleges that the company is conducting an ongoing illegal securities offering as Ripple still periodically sells XRP tokens out of the treasury.

Ripple recently filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the SEC seeking documents pertaining to Ethereum co-founders.

Just yesterday, Dogecoin made history for cracking the top 10 cryptoassets by marketcap for the first time since 2015. The currency named after a dog meme that was started as a joke was propelled to such lofty heights on the back of similarly record-breaking social media volume, according to analytics provided by The TIE.

While some tied the rapid price appreciation to Elon Musk memes and the inevitable groupthink of crypto’s often momentum-based markets, $DOGE’s success may also be rooted in anti-establishment sentiments running rife through the retail crowd following popular trading app Robinhood disabling ‘Buy’ orders for certain assets.

The move from Robinhood and other brokers prompted furious accusations of hypocrisy and speculation that hedge funds were being favored over smaller investors — and what's a better way to highlight a broken system than pumping a joke coin to a multi-billion dollar valuation?

However, after reports of withdrawal issues on multiple centralized exchanges, Dogecoin has undergone a violent overnight reversal, leading many buyers to take to social media to express their regret. Just a few hours after posting that she’d “finally caved and bought the dog stock,” podcast host and media personality Mia Khalifa indicated some buyer’s remorse:

Dogecoin price licks GameStop's heels

Dogecoin already has something in common with $GME, both assets having seen publicity tweets from Tesla CEO and world's richest man, Elon Musk in recent weeks. As Cointelegraph reported, Musk's tongue-in-cheek endorsement of DOGE was enough to induce serious price action.

On Reddit itself, users attempted to insert hints to invest in the meme-based altcoin, despite dedicated posts being removed by r/Wallstreetbets moderators.

As the fear of repercussions mounts over GameStop's performance, meanwhile, cryptocurrency proponents argue that Reddit users combining forces to outpace unprepared institutions are simply playing by the rules of capitalism.

""I know this GameStop stuff is funny, but you have to remember this is hurting real people who own multiple boats,"" Kevin Farzad, a member of music group Sure Sure, added.

$GME gained 200% on Wednesday, with after hours trading seeing a reversal of around 15% from the top.

Once the massive pump lost momentum and traders quickly took profits, it seemed that investors would move on past the meme-based cryptocurrency and find something else to invest in.

The pump initially started when exchanges prevented retail traders from buying more GameStop and AMC stock on Jan. 28. Fueled by the Reddit discussion group r/Wallstreetbets, the army of investors turned their attention to silver and a selection of ‘cheap’ cryptocurrenceis.

On Jan.28, Twitter user ""WSB Chairman"" asked, ""Has Doge ever been to a dollar?"" to his 750,000 followers. That was enough to trigger the monster rally, despite Dogecoin having no protocol upgrades or developments since 2015.

The 68% retracement that followed the peak at $0.087 resembled Bitcoin's (BTC) sharp drop after the December 2017 crash, except this time around, instead of 50 days, it took only 24 hours.

Multiple social media influencers and streamers expressed their discontent at buying the top, an indication that the momentary speculative frenzy had passed. After spending most of Jan. 30 and Jan. 31 hovering around $0.03, DOGE managed to produce another 80% pump in less than three hours.

It's almost impossible to find the exact trigger for those events, as there are multiple social networks, including private Telegram groups and trading signal apps.

Reddit's r/SatoshiStreetBets currently has 213,000 active users and following DOGE’s breakout a meme-post by user Woke_AF_Populist quickly climbed to its most upvoted list.

There seems to be endless support from the Dogecoin fanbase, including Tesla's CEO and founder Elon Musk. The lack of a concrete use case for the meme-coin certainly raises the question of whether members of r/WallStreetBets will jump ship from traditional markets and embrace the generally unregulated ethos of the cryptocurrency sector.

The latest changes to the platform consist of the full rollout of a gift card feature and the integration of MoonPay, which has improved users’ capability of purchasing crypto with fiat-based bank cards.

After a trial run starting late last year, Freewallet has now fully launched a gift card feature aimed at making its users’ lives easier from an e-commerce perspective. With the new feature, users can now buy gift cards for online and brick-and-mortar businesses with any cryptocurrency supported by the platform. The process is simple and can be completed in just a few minutes.

To make the feature possible, Freewallet has partnered with over 800+ brands from around the world, including Amazon, eBay, iTunes and many more. The feature comes with a search tool that allows users to organize their options according to popularity or alphabetical order and includes offerings from a wide variety of stores covering a whole spectrum of consumer needs — including beauty and lifestyle, booksellers, department stores, electronics, entertainment, food and drink, home and DIY, jewelers, leisure and sports, men’s fashion, supermarkets, toys and games, travel and women’s fashion.

These gift cards make the perfect gift option for crypto enthusiasts looking to do something special for their friends and loved ones, and it’s even a great way to treat themselves without having to use fiat. Each gift card can range in value from $1–$1,000, depending on the user’s preference.

The gift card feature is just one of the recent changes to be introduced to the platform. Another significant development has been the integration of MoonPay, one of the industry’s premier fiat-to-crypto transaction facilitators. By bringing in MoonPay, Freewallet has enhanced its purchase-with-card function. Now users can use any of the 42 major fiat currencies supported by MoonPay to purchase Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Chiliz (CHZ), Litecoin (LTC), Stellar (XLM), USD Coin (USDC), EOS, Tron (TRX), NEO, Dai, VeChain (VET), Zilliqa (ZIL), TrueUSD (TUSD), 0x (ZRX), Paxos Standard Token (PAX), Decentraland (MANA), Civic (CVC), EOSDT and USDT20.

These changes are the result of the continuous dialogue between the Freewallet development team and its community. As the platform continues to grow, it has made it a priority to become an all-inclusive crypto hub for its users. Freewallet prides itself on pairing groundbreaking technology with intuitive simplicity.

Solomon Brown, head of PR at Freewallet, had this to say about the changes: “We are really pleased that we can introduce more useful features for our users. We have been quite lucky in that we have been able to gather a large community around our platform and listen to the feedback they provide us with. It is amazing to see both the strides that we have taken as a service and the progress being made in the industry as a whole. We hope that our users will enjoy the new gift card feature as well as the retooled exchange.”

Founded in 2017, the company has built its services around a network of distributed resources that own and profit off unused hardware. Cudos clients can, therefore, harness cloud computing resources securely and at a much lower price as opposed to centralized alternatives. On the other hand, hardware owners are incentivized to share their computing resources in order to provide end-customers with low-latency and cost-effective resources.

The company has since launched the Cudos Network, an exciting endeavor into the blockchain technology market. Aware that high-performance blockchains must access off-chain computing resources, the Cudos Network bridges the gap between cloud computing and blockchain ledgers in a decentralized, secure and incentivizing manner. Over the long term, this will foster innovation across the blockchain space, as project developers will build more performant blockchains that rely on layer-two computations for innovative use cases. The process has already started as Cudos has partnered up with numerous companies in the tech space, including AMD, PlayStation Partners, Verne Global, Outlier Ventures, Sapphire, NexGen Cloud and others.

Cudos token listing on KuCoin

This cloud computing framework is unified under a common standard via Cudos, a utility token that provides access to worthwhile revenue streams within the Cudos Network. After being oversubscribed in the presale and raising over $10 million, the project is now listing Cudos on KuCoin.

Once the listing is live, KuCoin traders will have the opportunity to access a staking mechanism designed to reward users who choose to lock up their tokens for a limited timeframe. It’s imperative to keep in mind that the Cudos Network has its own staking system, which is a prerequisite to becoming an incentivized validator node, earning up to 30% of their stake per annum. Rewards are also available via the delegated staking program, which distributes rewards to users who fail to accumulate the 2-million staking minimum. Cudos ownership is necessary to access cloud compute jobs, representing an all-around access ticket to the Cudos ecosystem.

Cudos value potential grows

Cudos isn’t only listed on KuCoin, however. In fact, the token was first listed as part of a primary listing event on BitMax, only to be later listed on Poloniex as well. Trade analysis shows impressive price gains following the initial listing, thereby highlighting Cudos’ potential as a rewarding utility token. To put this into perspective, the Cudos strategic funding phase debuted at $0.006 per token and managed to attain a $0.12 appreciation as soon as the token was listed on the public market, highlighting a 2,000% rise.

Now trading at an average of $0.07, Cudos is certainly generating considerable hype for cloud computing enthusiasts. As expected, Cudos’ initial investors have been greatly rewarded following the recent price increases, consolidating the idea that people believe in the project’s utility and value proposition for the blockchain market.

Exploring the Cudos tokenomics

The Cudos token is hard-capped at 10 billion coins, with most of the funds raised via the token sales destined to fund the platform’s development, marketing strategy, validator nodes and customer acquisition efforts.

In the foreseeable future, the Cudos token will find itself listed on a growing number of cryptocurrency exchanges, facilitating profit-seeking trades between compatible crypto pairs. At this time, the token is available for purchase and sale via the CUDOS/USDT pair. More trading pairs will be added in the near future.

The CUDOS/USDT trading pair will debut trading at 10:00 on Feb. 2, 2021.

Cryptocurrency has everyone from big finance to governments making price predictions of Bitcoin’s price going over $300,000, according to CitiGroup. With that, would trading platforms want to exclude Main Street from participating?

Today, there’s a hot new exchange coming into the market with a slightly different focus named BloxXwop (pronounced “block-swop”). Its focus is on decentralization, speed, security and inclusion. BloxXwop sets a new bar on what the industry can be with new institutional players coming in to carry out the will of the people. The exchange has a fast-moving red-black interface and navigates sleekly.

On a decentralized exchange, users own their wallets and private keys, which are stored independently of the exchange itself. This, in turn, means that users truly own their tokens and have no trading limits imposed by the exchange. Exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase control your crypto assets, which means that issues could arise in the event of a systems breach. This also means your wallet or account is being held by an exchange that can limit your access. Other such examples include PayPal, Square or Apple, which have announced their plans to enter into crypto. The ownership credentials are stored by the users, thus allowing total freedom. The timing is perfect because Robinhood and Etrade have been limiting trading for individual investors, allowing more time for institutional players.

BloxXwop has introduced to the crypto industry its riveting mixture of functionality, customer experience and simple messaging. In functionality, “DeFi democracy” are the words used to describe the voting mechanism of the platform. Its native Bloxx token enables users to cast votes for tokens they would like to see added to the exchange, combined with a staking protocol on the exchange. This differs from a DEX such as Uniswap, which has taken the burgeoning market by storm. Uniswap, however, only allows ERC tokens, which blocks out the likes of Bitcon and other chains. BloxXwop allows for cross-chain listing, enabling people to still have access to fan favorites, such as Bitcoin, Litecoin (LTC), XRP, etc. This takes additional development, which is what the founders of the Bloxx Foundation set as a cornerstone to allow the inclusion of all crypto assets. From a customer experience standpoint, BloxXwop breaks the mold with the flow of an exchange that has the comfort of a top-tier, centralized trading platform all while maintaining DEX protocols. BloxXwop is also proud to offer the ability to purchase assets on the exchange with credit/debit cards and peer-to-peer, on-chain transfers using just usernames. This is far removed from the days of EtherDelta.

The Bloxx Foundation best quality is that it has hardcoded in its DEX 1% of all profits to go to a charitable endeavor serving impoverished and undercapitalized regions of the world. Dillon Omane, president of BloxXwop Exchange, has been in the spotlight in the tech space, starting with a win at the TechCrunch Disrupt NY Hackathon in 2016. Since then, he has gone on to hone his skills, developing projects with major financial institutions, such as Bank of America, CitiGroup, etc. Omane, a newcomer to the blockchain industry, will be taking over for Antoine Bell, son of international football superstar JoJo Bell, who is moving to the board of advisors to focus on the foundation’s marketing efforts.

Catch the initial sign up offer to get free airdropped tokens and participate in our sweepstakes to win some free BTC on the company’s website. BloxXwop is ushering in the new year with the launch of its BloxXwop Exchange. Bloxx tokens are now live on Uniswap. Stay tuned to see how this new startup focused on diversity and inclusion fares with the tide turning in favor of decentralized finance.","['means', 'bloxx', 'uniswap', 'industry', 'trading', 'exchange', 'decentralized', 'users', 'crypto', 'bloxxwop', 'robinhood', 'blocks', 'tokens']","On a decentralized exchange, users own their wallets and private keys, which are stored independently of the exchange itself.

The new product, dubbed Codefi Staking, provides “institutional staking tools for Ethereum 2.0,” whose beacon chain launched on Dec. 1 after securing the minimum deposit contracts. By partnering with Securosys, ConsenSys says it was able to create a more secure method for long-term Ethereum staking.

The enhanced security is achieved by removing the “challenges of operating independent validator nodes,” ConsenSys said. Securosys provides multiple key control mechanisms to ensure that stakers never relinquish control over their Eth2 withdrawal keys.

“By combining Codefi with Securosys Hardware Security Modules our customers achieve the highest level of security and convenience when moving from Eth1 to Eth2,” says Kuhan Tharmananthar, the product lead at Codefi Staking.

Ethereum 2.0 brings the promise of proof-of-stake, or PoS, a major milestone for the smart-contract platform. The transition from the current proof-of-work consensus to the desired PoS isn't without challenges. To validate transactions on Eth2, stakers need ""assurance that they are safe from all types of attacks and failures during the first transition phase,"" the company says.

Under PoS, users can stake tokens to earn rewards for validating blocks. In the case of Ethereum, holding 32 ETH entitles users to participate in the network and obtain a reward.

At the time of writing, more than 2.87 million Ether (ETH) had been sent to the Eth2 deposit contract.

Ethereum’s price has been trekking upward at a faster rate than Bitcoin over the past year. Last month, the cryptocurrency peaked at a new all-time high above $1,470 before backtracking. It now trades below $1,400 on major exchanges.","['security', 'launch', 'ether', 'protocol', 'pos', 'eth2', 'longterm', 'staking', 'users', 'securosys', 'transition', 'ethereum', 'codefi', 'consensys']","ConsenSys, a New York-based Ethereum software company, has partnered with a cybersecurity firm by the name of Securosys to launch a more secure staking solution for Eth2.

The accelerator program runs for 12 weeks, from Feb. 1 until late April. Each participant receives €15,000 ($18,100) in seed funding from blockchain fund Borderless Capital.

Massimo Morini, Algorand Foundation’s chief economist, said:

""Following the success of our Asia Accelerator Program, I’m excited about the launch of the Algorand Europe Accelerator. Europe is crucial for Algorand’s growth, and London is an important startup hub and a crucial financial center.”

The payment and lending startups involved in the accelerator program include ZTLment, Payscript, Smart-Chain and Blockchain Italia.

STOKR, Blockswap Network and Ockams were selected for the infrastructure category.

Cortex, Kontinuous and ArtSquare.io round out the network-driven platform category, Algorand said.

The lone IoT company to be included is the data marketplace platform NetObjex.

The inaugural accelerator program received 200 applications, according to Nassim Olive, partner at Eterna Capital, a global blockchain fund that partnered with Algorand.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, the Algorand Foundation announced its accelerator program in October as a way to spearhead Algorand-based application development in Europe, which is viewed as a critical fin-tech hub. In addition to funding, the chosen projects will receive expertise in strategy formulation, market execution and subject matter guidance. Successful projects will be eligible to receive up to $500,000 in additional investments from Borderless Capital and LongHash Ventures.

According to Brave New Coin, blockchain firm Multichain Ventures will be using the company’s data and pricing infrastructure to fulfill regulatory requirements for cannabis businesses in the state of Nevada. Recreational and medical marijuana has been legal in Nevada since 2016, but a bill introduced to the state’s legislature two years ago seeks for registered cannabis businesses to have a cashless payment system.

The bill says this measure is intended for regulators to ""monitor and facilitate the financial transactions of marijuana establishments, medical marijuana establishments, consumers and holders of registry identification cards."" In addition, a cashless system would ""reduce the risk to the safety and welfare of the public,"" according to the bill.

Though the legislation does not specify payments must be in crypto, it does require the Nevada State Treasurer to establish a pilot program for ""closed-loop payment processing systems"" for such businesses. Brave New Coin said that customers buying cannabis would soon be able to convert their cash into tokenized credits to make their purchases.

""Most business operators take traditional banking for granted, but the cannabis industry is cut off from most financial services in the U.S.,"" said Brave New Coin founder and CEO Fran Strajnar. ""Operators have had to be particularly innovative when it comes to managing their cash.""

In the U.S., medicinal and recreational cannabis is still illegal in many areas, as individual states often mandate laws independently of the federal government. ""Green"" sales across the country likely exceeded $20 billion in 2020, with Nevada's cannabis dispensaries reporting roughly $600 million in sales through the end of September.

According to a report by the American political publication Politico, Tenev is expected to participate in a virtual hearing headed by Representative Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) on Feb. 18. Politico’s report cited anonymous people familiar with the matter.

Waters officially announced the Financial Services Committee’s plans to hold a GameStop-related hearing on Feb. 18. Entitled “Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide,” the hearing will focus on recent market volatility issues involving GameStop and other stocks.

“I am concerned about whether or not Robinhood restricted the trading because there was collusion between Robinhood and some of the hedge funds that were involved with this,” Waters reportedly said.

The announcement did not specify what witnesses will participate in the hearing. Robinhood has not officially announced Tenev’s participation so far. The firm did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.

As previously reported, some U.S. regulators have already drawn attention to Robinhood’s handling the GameStop short squeeze. On Jan. 29, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission hinted that it was looking at Robinhood’s issues with GameStop, expressing concern over “extreme price volatility of certain stocks’ trading prices.”

Robinhood’s GameStop saga started on Jan. 28 when the company suspended buying for GameStop stock and other shares that were allegedly pumped through the r/Wallstreetbets Reddit community. Robinhood subsequently restricted trading for as many as 50 stocks on Friday before narrowing the restrictions to eight stocks on Feb. 8. Still, Robinhood users are limited to just one GameStop share.

On Feb. 1, Robinhood’s Tenev discussed the firm’s move to restrict trading with Elon Musk on the audio chat app Clubhouse. Tenev reportedly said that the decision about restrictions was made by a clearinghouse and was based on the capital requirements. He also denied allegations that trading firm Citadel Securities — the largest market maker in options in the U.S. — had pushed the firm to impose the limits.","['feb', 'house', 'testify', 'ceo', 'hearing', 'firm', 'robinhoods', 'trading', 'reportedly', 'stocks', 'tenev', 'gamestop', 'committee', 'robinhood']","Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev will reportedly testify before the United States House Financial Services Committee over the firm’s role in the volatile trading of GameStop and other volatile stocks.

He also denied allegations that trading firm Citadel Securities — the largest market maker in options in the U.S. — had pushed the firm to impose the limits."

The new product, DOT ETP, will be listed on the Swiss SIX exchange on Feb. 4, 2021, 21Shares announced Tuesday.

The new ETP comes shortly after Polkadot was added to 21Shares’ major ETP product Crypto Basket ETP (HODL) on Jan. 29. Tracking five major cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), HODL has removed Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and is now listing Polkadot as the second-largest constituent after Bitcoin.

According to HODL ETP data from MVIS indices, Polkadot now accounts for about 27% of the product, while Bitcoin makes up around 50% of the ETP.

A spokesperson for 21Shares told Cointelegraph that the company does not make decisions on adding or deleting a certain asset from the HODL ETP. The representative stated that such decisions are up to MV Index Solutions. “As an issuer, we cannot decide what to add and delete [...] They have a committee which decides which constituents are added, increased, reduced or outright taken out.”

According to the announcement, the addition of Polkadot to the 21shares Crypto Basket ETP makes it the “perfect timing to add an additional single asset ETP to the already wide range of crypto ETPs” offered by 21shares.

21Shares CEO Hany Rashwan emphasized that the company remains committed to the demand seen from institutional investors. “After investors purchase their first Bitcoins through our ETPs, there is a natural transition to invest in other crypto assets,” Rashwan said. He added that the firm plans to add two or three more ETPs in the next three months:

“We benefit from trusted partners for the liquidity provision and upon continued institutional demand, we are launching the DOT ETP to give investors a safe, regulated, and easy way to obtain exposure to this exciting new blockchain technology. In the next 3 months, we aim to add 2 to 3 more innovative ETPs.”

Polkadot is a next-generation blockchain protocol connecting multiple specialized blockchains into one unified network. In mid-January 2021. Polkadot’s native token DOT made the headlines by overtaking XRP as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. At the time of writing, DOT is trading at $16.82, up nearly 5% over the past 24 hours and around 82% over the past 30 days, according to data from CoinGecko.","['investors', '21shares', 'etp', 'polkadot', 'list', 'dot', 'add', 'exchange', 'crypto', 'major', 'hodl', 'product', 'swiss']","21Shares, a major provider of cryptocurrency exchange-traded products, or ETP, is launching the world’s first Polkadot (DOT) ETP.

According to its website, Robinhood has lowered its list of restrictions to eight different stocks including GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, Express, Genius Brands International, Koss, Naked Brand Group and Nokia. Robinhood previously limited trading for as many as 50 stocks on Friday, CNBC reported.

As per the new restrictions, Robinhood users can still only buy one share of GameStop alongside five options contracts. AMC trading is capped at 10 shares and 10 options contracts.

Robinhood users who already hold a greater number of shares or contracts will have to sell their holdings in order to open more positions, the firm said:

“If you already hold a greater number of shares or contracts than the limits listed above, your positions will not be sold or closed. However, you will not be able to open more positions of each of these securities unless you sell enough of your holdings such that you are below the respective limit.”

Robinhood has been struggling to maintain its trading services while the r/Wallstreetbets Reddit community pumps stocks like GME to new all-time highs. On Thursday, Robinhood suspended GME purchases after the stock skyrocketed 1,400% from about $20 on Jan. 12. On Friday, the firm also temporarily disabled instant deposits for cryptocurrency purchases, citing “extraordinary market conditions.”

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission subsequently hinted that it was looking into the Robinhood platform, citing concerns over “extreme price volatility of certain stocks’ trading prices.”

Robinhood’s decision to halt GME trading was widely criticized in the trading community, with at least 100,000 negative reviews appearing on Robinhood’s page on the Google Play Store. Despite Google’s subsequent move to scrap thousands of negative reviews with its “fake review” tracking system, Robinhood app’s rating is still down to one star, with 294,954 reviews posted at publishing time.

Amid the ongoing issues, Robinhood users launched the “#robinhoodboycott” tag on Twitter, calling on traders to move their holdings off the platform. However, Robinhood is not the only company experiencing issues due to the GameStop short squeeze. On Saturday, online trading platform IG Group Holdings said that it will restrict any new positions on GME and AMC due to “extreme volatility” in the market.","['share', 'limited', 'platform', 'trading', 'stocks', 'gme', 'users', 'holdings', 'shares', 'gamestop', 'robinhood', 'positions']","Troubled trading app Robinhood has been narrowing the list of restricted stocks on its platform but is still keeping major restrictions on GameStop shares.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office accuses Mejia of using a suite of limited liability corporations to conceal the true nature of his operations while exchanging cash for Bitcoins over a period spanning more than two years.

The complaint accuses Mejia of transferring funds between Bitcoin and U.S. dollars worth at least $13 million for clients from May 2018 and September 2020 using his companies Worldwide Secure Communications, World Secure Data, and The HODL Group.

According to the proposed plea agreement, Mejia negotiated with a client who was cooperating with law enforcement to exchange Bitcoin for tens of thousands of dollars in cash between May 2019 and March 2020.

Despite the client informing Mejia that his primary customer was an Australian methamphetamine buyer during a meeting in March 2020, Meija was willing to proceed with the transaction. The complaint states Mejia carried out transactions worth more than a quarter of a million dollars for the client:

“Mejia and the client who was working with law enforcement conducted five Bitcoin-cash transactions that cumulatively exceeded $250,000, the plea agreement states.”

The client conducted at least five transactions worth more than $250,000 in total.

As part of his plea deal, Mejia has agreed to forfeit almost $234,000 in cash and approximately $95,500 in cryptocurrency and metals that were found at his California residences.

The deal also mandates that from now on, Meija will ""maintain, at most, one virtual currency wallet, and that one wallet shall be used for all personal transactions, limited to only using and possessing open public blockchain virtual currencies and restricted from using privacy-based blockchain virtual currencies.""

Mejia was charged on Friday, Jan. 29, and is expected to plead guilty to one count of money laundering and one count of operating an unlicensed money exchange which he failed to register with the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

Mejia is expected to go before a U.S. district court in March and faces a maximum statutory sentence of 25 years behind bars in federal prison.","['transactions', 'using', 'dollars', 'virtual', 'plea', 'mejia', 'faces', 'money', 'exchange', 'laundering', '25', 'crypto', '13m', 'operator', 'client', 'worth', 'unlicensed', 'enforcement']","49-year-old peer-to-peer crypto trader, Hugo Sergio Mejia, has agreed to plead guilty to charges of money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.

A Feb. 1 SEC announcement estimates that Bitcoiin Gen founder John DeMarr, Start Options founder Kristijan Krstic, and promotor Robin Enos duped investors out of more than $11 million through two fraudulent and unregistered securities offerings from December 2017 until May 2018.

The SEC alleges that Krstic and DeMarr first spruiked Start Options’ purported crypto asset mining and trading platform in December 2017 and January 2017, falsely claiming it was “the largest Bitcoin exchange in euro volume and liquidity” at the time.

From January until May of 2018, the trio then promoted Bitcoiin2Gen’s ICO, with the SEC accusing the individuals of knowingly disseminating fraudulent promotional materials to the investing public.

The complaint asserts Bitcoiin2Gen’s empty promises included purporting Ethereum compatibility for its B2G token, claiming the raised funds would be reinvested into developing a mineable crypto asset, and asserting the B2G token would be tradable on a proprietary exchange. However, according to the SEC:

“Bitcoiin2Gen was a sham, and Krstic and DeMarr allegedly misappropriated millions of dollars of investor funds for their own personal benefit.”

Krstic and DeMarr will face charges of violating the antifraud and registration provisions of federal securities laws, while Enos will face charges of aiding and abetting said antifraud violations. The SEC is seeking disgorgement plus interest, penalties, and a bar against Krstic and DeMarr from operating or directing companies in future.

“The conduct alleged in this action was a blatant attempt to victimize those interested in digital asset technology and these defendants should be held accountable,"" said Kristina Littman, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit

On the same day, the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Department of Justice announced parallel criminal charges against DeMarr.

In addition to their investors, Bitcoiin2Gen also appears to have scammed actor Steven Seagal — who was promised $750,000 in B2G tokens and $250,000 in cash for promoting Bitcoiin2Gen’s ICO in 2018. However, Seagal claims to have only received $157,000 for plugging the offering.

Seagal was charged by the SEC in February 2020 for failing to disclose the remuneration he received in exchange for promoting the ICO on his social channels and was ordered to pay $330,000 to the commission.","['securities', '2018', 'krstic', 'charges', 'seagalspruiked', 'asset', 'b2g', 'steven', 'promoters', 'exchange', 'ico', 'sec', 'demarr', 'bitcoiin2gens']","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has charged three individuals for various cryptocurrency frauds including the 2018 initial coin offering for the Steven Seagal-promoted altcoin, Bitcoiin2Gen.

According to a Feb. 1 report from Glassnode, the amount of USDC on exchanges increased by more than 112% in January alone, growing from $431 million to over $915 million.

Since the beginning of the year, roughly $1 billion worth of new USDC has been minted — of which more than 90% has been sent to centralized exchanges.

With nearly half a billion worth of USDC making its way onto exchanges in a single month, Glassnode speculates that traders are planning to mobilize the tokens to buy up any forthcoming dips in the crypto markets:

“This high figure should increase investors' confidence in any dips being quickly bought up, making it a bullish signal.”

USDC’s January growth may have been bolstered by Circle introducing a stablecoin-to-fiat bridge to enable seamless transfers from USDC to USD last month.

Since the beginning of 2020, the supply of Circle’s stablecoin has surged by over 900% from just over 500 million to 5.1 billion according to company stats.

By contrast, the amount of Tether in circulation has increased by around 500% over the same period. However, Tether’s recent increase in capitalization represents more than four-times the fiat-value of USDC’s growth over the past 13 months.

The third-largest stablecoin by circulation is MakerDAO’s Dai, which has grown in capitalization by a whopping 3,800% from just $40 million in January 2020 to more than $1.6 billion today. Binance’s stablecoin, BUSD, also saw significant growth with a 600% increase in supply over the same period to currently boast a $1.4 billion capitalization.

With rival stablecoins outpacing Tether’s growth recently, USDT’s stablecoin dominance has dropped below 75% for the first time, according to Coin Metrics.

The drop in Tether’s stablecoin market share may be somewhat attributed to the company’s ongoing legal woes with the New York Attorney General, potentially prompting traders to seek alternative stable tokens to protect against the risk of USDT losing its peg during the proceedings. Tether has lost its peg several times in recent history, dropping down to $0.96 on Jan. 5, 2021, and in October 2018.

Tether may come under further pressure should the new ‘Stable Act’ be passed by U.S. lawmakers. If passed, the bill would require stablecoin issuers to obtain a chartered banking license, submit to audits by the Federal Reserve, obtain insurance and possibly store assets at the federal reserve.","['usd', 'doubled', 'dominance', 'exchanges', 'growth', 'tethers', 'billion', 'increase', 'million', 'stablecoin', 'worth', 'usdc', 'lows', 'fell', 'traders']","The sands are shifting in the stablecoin ecosystem, with Circle’s USD Coin quickly eating into the dominance of the sector’s leader, Tether.

Appearing on Anthony Pompliano’s podcast on Feb. 2, Lummis announced her intention to establish the caucus, stating:

“We hope to use it as a springboard to educate members of the U.S. Senate and their staff about Bitcoin specifically, but about other opportunities for cryptocurrency and financial innovation and blockchain.”

Lummis stated the caucus will first work to fight the false narrative about digital assets and crypto being used for money laundering, noting that research from blockchain forensics firm Chainalysis indicates “cryptocurrency-related crime is smaller than criminal activity with cash.”

Lummis noted she recently spoke with treasury secretary Janet Yellen — whose recent comments regarding the use of crypto in illicit financing caused concerns regarding an incoming regulatory crackdown to reverberate across the crypto-sphere.

Lummis sought to quell the crypto community's concerns about Yellen, describing the treasury secretary as having “an open mind” about crypto. However, the senator stated: “It’s going to take a lot of work to get to where we can have an open dialogue that is free from the clutter of seeing this knee-jerk reaction to the concern that all crypto is subject to criminal activity.”

“Crypto regulations need to leave room for innovation.”

Senator Lummis purchased Bitcoin during 2013 and 2014, and has since touted Bitcoin’s utility as a store of value. She likened Bitcoin to the permanent mineral trust fund that she oversaw while working as Wyoming’s state treasurer during the 2000s.

“I was state treasurer in Wyoming during the first part of the 21st century so I was always looking for a store of value. We have in Wyoming permanent funds that are based on extracting minerals and oil and gas from the ground. We take a severance tax [...] from minerals and invest it in a permanent fund,” she said.

“The concept of that permanent mineral trust fund is that when the minerals are gone we will still have revenue left over because we invested the proceeds and continued to invest them in a diversified asset allocation [...] Bitcoin reminded me of our permanent mineral fund.”

“There will only be 21 million Bitcoin mined, and because it is a finite resource, I see it as a very good store of value,” Lummis concluded.","['bitcoin', 'educate', 'launch', 'financial', 'store', 'lummis', 'mineral', 'lawmakers', 'value', 'minerals', 'fund', 'crypto', 'innovation', 'caucus', 'permanent', 'senator']","Senator Cynthia Lummis, the first senator in the history of the United States to own Bitcoin, has revealed plans to launch a Financial Innovation Caucus to educate her fellow senators on cryptocurrency and digital assets.

Data from the cryptocurrency analysis firm shows that more than 15,200 BTC, currently worth over $515 million, were withdrawn from Coinbase on Jan. 31.

According to Ki Young Ju, the withdrawal “went to custody wallets that only have in-going transactions,” and was likely an “OTC deal from institutional investors” based on several identifiers.

He also pointed to the fact that the split of a 15,000 BTC wallet into wallets containing 1,000-5,000 BTC increases security costs. Furthermore, most of the internal transfers are done with round amounts, like 1,000 to 5,000 Bitcoin, while this transfer included odd groupings of 1,265, 2,391, and 1,957 BTC.

As to why Coinbase outflows are a bullish sign for the top cryptocurrency, Ki Young Ju linked to a previous tweet from Dec. 18 which states that “if Coinbase moves a significant amount of Bitcoins to other cold wallets, it indicates OTC deals” which are non-exchange transactions.

He said:

“Since the price is eventually determined on exchanges, massive non-exchange transaction volume is considered as a bullish signal. These transactions include OTC deals.”

The slow inflow of institutions into the cryptocurrency sector is helping to increase the legitimacy of the crypto sector as a whole and appears to be providing a certain level of support for the price of BTC as the available supply continues to be locked away in cold custodial wallets.

While the media were pointing to Bitcoin’s price drop from $42,000 to below $30,000 as a sign that the BTC bubble had popped once again, the purchase of 4,000 BTC on Feb.1 indicates that institutions have instead seen this as an opportunity to buy the dip and are taking full advantage of this buying opportunity.","['bitcoin', 'otc', 'ceo', 'sign', 'wallets', 'cryptoquant', 'cryptocurrency', 'ki', 'bullish', 'young', 'price', 'signal', 'btc', 'coinbase', 'outflows']","Recent Bitcoin (BTC) outflows from Coinbase are reminiscent of the “proof-of-keys” days and could be a sign of a bullish future, according to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju.

In light of the sideways price action, Ki Young Ju, the CEO of the cryptocurrency analysis firm CryptoQuant, spotted a potential bullish indicator that may indicate a price breakout in the near future for Bitcoin.

According to Ju, more than 15,000 Bitcoin were recently withdrawn from Coinbase Pro with the outflows going “into custody wallets that only have in-going transactions,” indicating the purchases were likely “OTC deals from institutional investors.” Rallies have followed similar outflows in the past, and Ju sees this as a sign BTC will “protect $33,000 in the short-term.”

The question is: “Where would it come from?” Official development aid, philanthropy and public finances cannot suffice, which means the needle is moving toward private capital to fund sustainable development projects.

But the gap between financing and the environmental impact does not exude the confidence of private investors to fund development projects. India, a center of sustainability risks and innovative interventions, offers an example of this gap. Between 2014–2015 and 2018–19, corporate social responsibility, or CSR, spent by the approximately 1,100 listed Indian corporates grew at a rate of 16%, while India’s score on the United Nations Development Programme’s Human Development Index grew by roughly 1% compound annual growth rate, or CAGR. Ironically, most CSR spending by Indian companies goes to education and health — the very sectors the HDI index focuses on.

It is time for blockchain tech

Can blockchain technology be a workable solution? It can because development projects conduct measuring, reporting and verification, or MRV, processes measure the outcome and impact of projects. Most readers are aware that distributed ledger technology stores data batches in blocks on the network, and the need for independent verification from the network’s users makes the records transparent, secure, verifiable, and immutable. These are the very attributes by which blockchain can improve the MRV processes, thus improving data auditability and reducing misreporting/fraud of data. This can incentivize private capital to consider investing in this space.

Moreover, if we must identify the precise activity of a typical development project where blockchain technology can be leveraged, then it would collect and time-stamp project-level data for monitoring purposes. The challenge is many resource-crunched development projects, especially in developing countries, still collect field data by hand, which can lead to inaccuracies, mistakes and fraud. With a blockchain, such data can be collected and reported in a secure, transparent and verifiable manner.

What also adds adverse effects is the local institutions in the developing countries that implement such projects often lack the systems to ensure the data they report is verifiable. Weak regulations in such countries make it difficult to hold such local institutions to account. Add to this the distance between foreign investors and these local projects, and it becomes harder to stay on the same level.

Blockchain can reduce the data risks of local-level institutions, improve the validity of the data they report for impact, and instill confidence in foreign private donors/investors to fund such development projects.

Blockchain and MRV processes

What this implies is more financing flow can be committed to the local level. Back in 2017, the International Institute for Environment and Development estimated that only 10% of the $60 billion in public and private climate finance is directly committed to the local level, which is partly due to such perceived data risks. Using blockchain to improve MRV can facilitate greater access to capital for local-level institutions.

With blockchain enabling local projects to report verifiable performance as part of their MRV processes, local development institutions can gain a greater supply of capital. The Amazon in Brazil is an example. The Rainforest project uses blockchain and the Internet of Things to record and transfer data from electrical meters, robotic appliances and emission monitors on the environmental impact. Remote sensing satellites independently verify the status of patches, upon which blockchain smart contracts directly reward the farmers who preserve their rainforest patches. The outcome data is verifiable, and the exclusion of intermediaries while transferring incentives minimizes administrative costs and the siphoning of funds.

Blockchain-enabled MRV processes help disintermediate the intermediaries in a social or sustainability bond issuance, thus reducing issuance costs and making it possible for small enterprises to access the bond market or aggregate smaller assets into bonds. Already, leading Spanish bank BBVA uses blockchain to structure green bonds and loans.

As long as limitations such as internet capacity and technology literacy can be overcome, blockchain’s revolutionary role in improving the MRV processes around data can mobilize more private capital investments for development projects executed by local-level institutions in developing countries.

Several companies are investing billions of dollars on the network; it topped LinkedIn’s list of in-demand hard skills in 2020, and articles about its potential are now littered on every finance blog. Ask those who had experienced the early internet days, and they will certainly have a lot to tell you about the feeling of deja vu that has diffused the tech space.

Mainstream maximalist circles have touted blockchain as the magic solution for many industries — healthcare probably being the neediest. Forbes’ report revealed that up to 112 million healthcare data records were either stolen, lost or compromised in 2015. While there’s no telling how many wrecks this has caused, healthcare data is delicate, and every solution must be examined carefully.

Of course, blockchain’s potentials could unlock a different side to medicine and bring solutions to age-long problems in the profession. On the other hand, a lack of proper understanding of the pitfalls could massively hinder the potential locked up in this partnership. Let’s highlight four crucial drawbacks to adopting blockchain in healthcare.

Storage and data transfer

Stakeholders involved in healthcare — patients, payers, care providers and researchers — generate thousands of pieces of data every second, from background patient data to test results, images, medications and a host of other data that need to be constantly updated. Among all of this, confidentiality is at the very helm of medicine, and all health data must be carefully accounted for.

However, it is one thing to digitize health data, and another thing is to transfer tons of data to a publicly encrypted database. Dealing with different personnel and actual blockchain experts to transfer and update health data ironically leaves room for a massive data breach or improper documentation of health data. Besides that, the time required to arrange and update tons of health data systematically would be significantly alarming.

The blockchain trilemma

Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, coined the term “blockchain trilemma,” a term that describes the infeasibility of getting all three desirable properties of any blockchain-based use case — decentralization, security and scalability. In simpler terms, it is impossible to have all three components in one project. One has to be sacrificed for the other two. Considering blockchain is predicated (for the most part) on decentralization and security, it is quite glaring which one is the sacrificial lamb.

The degree of scalability dictates the capacity of any network and must be addressed before implementation. In an attempt to secure a blockchain network, the amount of data processed per second was limited by the developers. For blockchains exponentially growing, this has created a scalability problem as more people swarm the network. Poor blockchain scalability would mean healthcare stakeholders would be very limited in processing real-time data. Besides being unsuitable for emergency healthcare, the implication is that healthcare workers would have to do more with less.

Cost

In the long run, blockchain will ultimately save a lot of money for both patients and healthcare providers. For supply chains in pharmaceuticals, patient records and health insurance, healthcare costs will eventually be optimized. A BIS research suggests that blockchain would save up to $100 billion over an eight-year period.

However, blockchain’s early adoption in healthcare will certainly not come easy in terms of cost. The cost of building applications, reorientating stakeholders into a new system, security and maintenance is enormous. A blockchain network covering the entire United States healthcare system would cost hundreds of billions and would require patient investors and help from the government. However, optimal systems within a blockchain network can emerge with time and cut these potentially enormous fees.

Policies and regulations

Health data is highly sensitive, hence the strict regulations guiding healthcare professionals to do their job. Since the introduction of electronic health records, these regulations have continued to increase as health professionals seek to insulate themselves from medical malpractice.

The introduction of blockchain would be an entirely new and cumbersome method of handling health data; it would certainly go through rounds of policy reviews worldwide. Moreover, health professionals would be potentially exposed to thousands of lawsuits, and they might not be receptive to the technology.

Musk said that his friends tried to onboard him to the Bitcoin bandwagon as early as 2013, but the world’s richest man did not take the final step. Musk admitted that he was “late to the party.”

Musk also said that Bitcoin could be “on the verge of getting broad acceptance by conventional finance."" While these comments by the SpaceX founder are positive, they did not move the markets since he did not commit to buying Bitcoin as a personal investment or for the treasury reserves for his companies.

However, institutional investors have continued their purchases without waiting for a deeper correction. CoinCorner CEO Danny Scott noted that recently a single entity had withdrawn $500 million worth of Bitcoin, an indication of institutional buying.

While Bitcoin buyers seem to be planning to hold their positions, the same cannot be said about the pump and dump schemes that are being promoted in select altcoins. First, it was Dogecoin (DOGE) and today it is XRP’s 50% fall from $0.75 that may have left several novice traders with huge losses.

These violent corrections should be a lesson to traders and remind them to follow a well thought out trading strategy instead of getting carried away by emotions and greed.

Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the trend and the path of least resistance.

BTC/USD

Bitcoin has been hugging the downtrend line for the past three days, but the bulls have not been able to push and sustain the price above it. This shows that the bears are aggressively defending the higher levels.

BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day exponential moving average ($33,412) has flattened out and the relative strength index (RSI) is near the midpoint, suggesting a balance between supply and demand.

If the bears sink the price below the $31,900 support, the BTC/USD pair could drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($30,920) and then to the critical support at $28,850. A break below this level will complete a bearish descending triangle pattern that could start a deeper correction.

Conversely, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above $35,000 the pair may rally to $38,520 and then to $40,000. The next leg of the up-move could start after the bulls drive the price above the all-time high at $41,959.63.

ETH/USD

The bears are defending the $1,400 overhead resistance while the bulls are buying the dips to the 20-day EMA ($1,258). This suggests that Ether (ETH) is stuck in a tightening trading range, which is likely to expand within the next few days.

ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the resolution happens to the downside and the bears sink the price below the uptrend line, the selling could intensify. This may result in a possible drop to the 50-day SMA ($1,005) and then to the critical support at $840.93.

On the contrary, if the ETH/USD pair turns up from the current level and breaks above the $1,400 to $1,473.096 resistance zone, it will indicate the resumption of the uptrend. The pair could then rally to $1,675.

While the upsloping moving averages suggest an advantage to the bulls, the negative divergence on the RSI favors the bears. As the indicators are sending mixed signals, it is better to wait for the price to complete a breakout before taking a directional bet.

XRP/USD

XRP skyrocketed to an intraday high at $0.755 today, but the long wick on the day’s candlestick shows that traders used the higher levels to aggressively close their long positions.

XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The XRP/USD pair has plunged to the $0.3885 support. If the bears sink the price below this level, the selling could intensify and the pair could drop to the moving averages and then to $0.245, giving back all of the recent gains.

A break below $0.245 could result in a fall to $0.17351. On the other hand, if the bulls can defend the $0.3885 support, the pair may again attempt to rally to $0.60.

DOT/USD

Polkadot’s (DOT) rebound on Jan. 28 fizzled out at $17.7522 on Jan. 29. The failure of the bulls to push the price to the top of the $14.7259 to $19.40 range suggests demand dries up at higher levels.

DOT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The 20-day EMA ($15.41) has started to flatten out and the RSI is gradually dropping towards the center, which points to a balance between supply and demand. If the price rebounds off the $14.7259 support, the consolidation may extend for a few more days.

Contrary to this assumption, a break below the $14.7259 support will be the first sign of weakness. That could pull the DOT/USD pair down to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $11.8383.

This negative view will invalidate if the bulls can push the price above the $19.40 range. Such a move will signal the resumption of the uptrend.

ADA/USD

Cardano (ADA) broke above the downtrend line on Jan. 30, but the bulls could not push the price above the $0.38 resistance, which shows that demand dries up at higher levels.

ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

However, the positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the support line of the ascending channel. The buyers are currently attempting to defend the 20-day EMA ($0.33).

A strong rebound off the current levels could reach the $0.38 overhead resistance. If the bulls can push the price above this level, the ADA/USD pair could resume the uptrend, with the next target objective at $0.48.

Conversely, if the bears pull the price below the support line of the channel, the pair could drop to $0.28 and then to the 50-day SMA ($0.25).

LINK/USD

Chainlink (LINK) has not been able to sustain above the $24 level for the past few days, which suggests traders are closing their long positions on rallies.

LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The RSI has formed a descending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close below 53. Sometimes, the patterns on the indicators project the upcoming directional move in the price.

If the bears can sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($21.18), the selling could intensify and break the $20.1111 support. If that happens, the LINK/USD pair could drop to $17.7777 and then to the 50-day SMA ($16.63).

This negative view will invalidate if the pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA or the $20.1111 support and sustains above the downtrend line. Such a move will enhance the prospects of the resumption of the uptrend.

LTC/USD

Litecoin (LTC) has been facing stiff resistance at the downtrend line for the past few days. The long wick on the day’s candlestick suggests every relief rally is being sold into.

LTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the bulls fail to push the price above the downtrend line within the next few days, the possibility of a break below the $120 support increases. If that happens, the LTC/USD pair will complete a bearish head and shoulders pattern, which has a target objective of $55.

However, it may not be a straight fall because the bulls will try to stall the decline at $100 and then again at $70.

This negative view will be negated if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the downtrend line. Such a move will suggest that the selling pressure may have ended. On the upside, a break above $150 will suggest the bulls are making a comeback.

BCH/USD

The relief rally in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is facing stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($429), which suggests the bears are attempting to defend this level. If the price turns down and breaks below the $370 to $353 support zone, the altcoin could drop to $275.

BCH/USD daily chart. Source: TradingView

The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest the bears have a marginal edge.

Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, the BCH/USD pair may rally to $465 and then to $539. If the price turns down from this resistance, the pair could extend its consolidation for a few more days.

BNB/USD

Binance Coin (BNB) soared above the previous all-time high at $47.2187 and hit a new high at $50.60 today. Whenever the price of an asset class makes a new all-time high, it shows that the bulls are in command.

BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

However, the long wick on today’s candlestick suggests profit-booking near the psychological resistance at $50. If the price fails to rise and sustain above $50, the BNB/USD pair could consolidate in a tight range for a few days.

A breakout and close above $50 could start the next leg of the up-move that may reach $60. Conversely, if the bears sink the price below $46, the pair could drop to the support line of the ascending broadening wedge pattern. A break below this support could signal the start of a deeper correction.

XLM/USD

The bulls and the bears are locked in a battle for supremacy in the $0.325 to $0.35 zone for the past three days. Although the bulls pushed Stellar (XLM) above $0.35 on Jan. 28, 30, and today, they could not sustain the higher levels, which shows traders are booking profits on rallies.

XLM/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

However, the bulls have not allowed the price to sink below the 20-day EMA ($0.28), indicating accumulation at lower levels. The bulls are currently trying to push and sustain the price above the overhead resistance zone.

If they succeed, the XLM/USD pair could rise to $0.409. A breakout and close above this resistance may start the journey towards $0.50. The rising moving averages and the RSI above 61 suggest the bulls have the upper hand.

This positive view will invalidate if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($0.228).

The move seems to have been fueled by r/Satoshistreetbets, an off-shoot of r/Wallstreetbets.

It seems that speculative social media group-based investing is becoming a trend so let’s take a look at what triggers might have catalyzed the recent surge in XRP price.

XRP Twitter activity vs. Price. Source: TheTie

Data from TheTie, an alternative data provider focused on social analytics, shows just how significant the impact of active Twitter users has been on XRP price.

Even Gene Simmons, the legendary musician from the rock band, KISS, told his nearly 900,000 followers:

“Not recommending any of these to anyone. But yes, I also bought Dogecoin, XRP, and others. Make of it what you will.”

Was there short interest behind this move?

Knowing exactly what triggered the investors to crowd into XRP could uncover a set of criteria that may apply to other cryptocurrencies.

Hedge funds with sizeable short positions are what drew investors to GameStop and AMC stock. By coordinating a pump on these companies, buyers knew that would force short sellers to be liquidated and trigger the start of a strong rally.

Taking a look at Bitfinex’s long-to-short ratio shows that there’s currently $124 million total margin trades combining its USD and BTC based markets. Although that figure is up from $95 million a month ago, it’s more important to focus on the percentage favoring shorts.

XRP Longs vs. Shorts. Source: Bitfinex

The ratio seen on Jan. 29 favored longs by 180%, and this is the opposite of what’s necessary for a short squeeze. Moreover, in nominal terms, those $25 million margin shorts were not significant to XRP’s $1.55 billion average daily volume.

On the other hand, futures markets held a $277 million open interest, which is flat from the previous month. But unlike margin markets, buyers and sellers are matched at all times.

XRP aggregate futures open interest. Source: Bybt.com

As depicted above, despite the liquidations caused by the recent 147% rally, XRP’s open interest surged in nominal terms due to its price appreciation. To understand whether those traders had been using excess leverage on either side, one should focus on the futures contracts funding rate.

When sellers (shorts) are the ones demanding more leverage, the funding rate goes negative. Therefore, those traders will be the ones paying up the fees.

XRP aggregate futures open interest. Source: Bybt.com

As shown above, buyers had been using more leverage. Albeit relatively steady over the past 30 days, the last time negative funding rates occurred was Dec. 24 and Dec. 29. Both dates mark local lows after substantial price corrections caused by the SEC lawsuit against XRP.

Therefore, it is safe to assume that r/Satoshibets did not pick XRP based on margin shorts nor futures leveraged trades.

Apart from being a sub-$10 coin, XRP was one of the most distant from its all-time high. It’s also important to consider that before its recent 1,000% pump, Dogecoin (DOGE) was also trading 90% below its $0.078 all-time high.

While it is indisputable that social investing groups have played some role in the recent rallies seen from Dogecoin, XRP, GameStop and AMC, the data do not validify the narrative that r/Satoshistreetbets chose to pump XRP because of the high level of shorts on the altcoin.

In a blog from the crypto exchange today, Kraken said it had donated the funds to promote Coin Center’s work in educating regulators about digital assets an advancing the rights of crypto users. The exchange said that the advocacy group ""has been a vanguard for challenging policies such as the proposed STABLE act as well as recent rushed Financial Crimes Enforcement Network rulemaking.""

""At a time when misinformation about this new technology remains high, we call on all industry leaders to join us in funding this essential work,"" said Kraken’s editor-at-large, Pete Rizzo.

Grayscale Investments donated $1 million to Coin Center last week as well, stating its intention to match donations up to an additional $1 million through the end of February. The digital asset manager said at the time that it supported Coin Center’s efforts in ""correcting issues in proposed rulemaking"" by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN.

Last month, U.S. lawmakers introduced the STABLE Act to Congress — a bill that could effectively require blanket regulation on all stablecoins. FinCEN later released a proposal to restrict money services businesses, including crypto exchanges registered in the United States, from dealing with self-hosted wallets. Both moves have received criticism from many in the crypto community.

A research and advocacy group focused on advancing public policy issues surrounding crypto and blockchain, Coin Center says its mission is to ""promote a regulatory climate that preserves the freedom to innovate using permissionless blockchain technologies."" The think tank has already filed two comments in response to FinCEN’s proposed wallet rule.

According to the report:

“Based on search volumes compared to 2017, bitcoin’s price increase seems to be driven less by hype. With bitcoin appearing to gain more trust, some companies are considering it as cash on their balance sheets.”

Coincheck originally announced that it was considering launching an NFT platform in August 2020. According to the latest announcement, Coincheck’s platform has already listed several NFTs for five popular games and gained exposure to over 2.2 million users.

Coincheck’s executive director Kensuke Amo said that the new partnership with Chiliz intends to bring more opportunities for local sports fans. “Japanese users will have the opportunity to get to know Chiliz and get closer to some of the biggest sporting organizations in the world by purchasing Socios.com NFTs on Coincheck’s NFT marketplace,” Amo said.

Chiliz and Socios CEO Alexandre Dreyfus noted that the partnership will allow Japanese users to own assets linked to some of world's biggest clubs like FC Barcelona and Juventus. The new collaboration comes in line with Chiliz and Socios’ global expansion and NFT plans in 2021 he said, adding:

“We’re really focused on NFTs in 2021 and have the potential to launch them with every single one of our partners. We’ll also be looking to give them a certain utility — for instance the chance to redeem rewards linked to the particular club,”

One of these is Futureswap, an AMM-based futures exchange specifically designed for large trades.

Futureswap has recently launched Version 2 of its platform, which features a unique oracle design that allows to increase capital efficiency for large trades. Benji Richards, co-founder of Futureswap, explained the idea to Cointelegraph:

“When you think of AMM people think of the constant-product like Uniswap. The main difference with ours is we took the AMM and didn't use the same formula. We designed it around the thesis that large trades should not be penalized for being large trades, which then will create a better ecosystem for what we call whale traders or massive arbitrageurs.”

AMM platforms use special formulas called “bonding curves” to determine how each trade changes an asset’s price. Uniswap’s formula is the simplest, as it attempts to keep the product of the two sides of the pools equal to a constant. Graphically, such a formula defines a hyperbola — a shape that approaches both infinity and zero on either side, without ever reaching them. While this is great for general-purpose AMMs, this curve is inefficient for large trades, as slippage rises exponentially with large order sizes.

Still, using a more efficient curve requires adding another constraint to make sure it is effective. In the case of Curve Finance, for example, the bonding curve can be made dramatically more efficient if the platform's limited to pegged assets — various iterations of U.S. dollars or wrapped cryptocurrencies. With Futureswap, a similar constraint is provided by custom-built oracles.

Richards said that this was necessary to avoid the issues with off-the-shelf solutions. “Most on-chain oracles have a delay, so if you’re going to use that for anything with leverage, it likely will not work,” he said. An Oracle-based design has been attempted by Bancor for its impermanent loss protection system, but it appears to not have been successful due to front-running issues.

Futureswap’s oracles are unique in that they allow to capture the small price fluctuations between two Ethereum blocks, which are spaced out by 15 seconds. It’s a similar mechanism to meta-transactions that allow others to pay for someone’s gas fee, Futureswap co-founder Derek Alia explained:

“The idea is that you sign some parameters, you say, ‘I want to do this action with this information’. You sign that with your private key. That's basically like a ball that someone passes to the Ethereum Blockchain.”

With Futureswap trades, users will essentially embed the oracle price data that they used to create that transaction, and the system guarantees that the value was valid when the transaction was created. By using the oracle price as an anchor, the platform can use much more aggressive bonding curves with lower slippage. Alia added:

“We need less capital to be more competitive with someone like Binance. Binance maybe needs $6 billion in their order book. We would need $300 million — or something like that — to have the same slippage.”

Like other AMMs, Futureswap also has passive liquidity providers who receive a fee for each trade going through the platform. Traders interact with these liquidity pools, with the ability to enter both long and short positions with up to 10x leverage. Though this may be considered low by cryptocurrency standards, this ceiling will be raised over time, Richards said.

Futureswap is still in the early stages of release, which is also reflected in its token model. Users and liquidity providers currently receive a non-transferable token that allows participating in the platform’s governance, as well as obtain utility through discounts. The team boasted of over $500 million in total volume so far, without any direct incentivization. Alia concluded:

“I think what's really cool is that a lot of people who are a little bit more ‘degen’ will come in, ask if the token is transferable and how they can buy and sell it. They find out they can’t, and then they leave.”","['curve', 'futureswap', 'platform', 'offer', 'wants', 'large', 'v2', 'platforms', 'defi', 'trades', 'oracle', 'price', 'think', 'token', 'whale', 'traders']","One of these is Futureswap, an AMM-based futures exchange specifically designed for large trades.

Grants don’t always involve members of the community — and in some cases, the process can be rather opaque.

In an article a few months ago, Lane Rettig said: “I have yet to see a well-run grants program in the blockchain space.”

Given how extensively grants are used across the industry, this is a rather damning indictment. Rettig argued that these schemes tend to be incredibly centralized. Not only does an organization end up setting the agenda for development, but in many cases, founders end up giving large grants to people they already know. He pointed to the Ethereum Foundation as an example, noting: “Some of the largest grants have been awarded to projects led by individuals who are close friends of Vitalik Buterin.”

Grants struggle to deliver “permissionless innovation,” Rettig said, which he described as “the superpower of blockchain.” This is what enables a teenager to start mining crypto from their laptop at home, without needing a credit card or to go through Know Your Customer checks.

Ultimately, the main risk associated with grants is that they can be offputting to people who have bright ideas but are daunted by filling out an application form. Cutting-edge concepts can end up being shut out and disregarded because they don’t fit into the rigid parameters of a grant program. Allegations of nepotism and unfairness can begin swirling around — and worse still, community members may feel that they don’t have a say in the future direction of the ecosystem.","['community', 'know', 'end', 'dont', 'contests', 'better', 'cases', 'grants', 'members', 'rettig', 'crypto', 'healthy', 'program']","What are the downsides of crypto grants?

Right now, staking ETH is a significant, long-term commitment.

The minimum amount that someone was able to contribute into the deposit contract was 32 ETH — and at one point in November, that was worth an eye-watering $19,877.

These funds are going to be locked until the current mainnet “docks” with the beacon chain. At present, estimates suggest that this milestone may only be reached in 2022, meaning that aspiring validators may have to wait some time until they get their funds back.

One of the biggest downsides with the transition to Eth2 is how this takes a lot of commitment from the thousands of validators who have put their crypto where their mouths are. It’s a leap of faith — not least because several other key milestones related to this project have been hit behind schedule. Should further complications arise, there’s a chance that it could be years before the deposited ETH is released from the one-way contract, and its cash value may have fallen by then.

Serving as a validator also comes with responsibilities… and risks. “Slashing” means that nodes can be penalized for failing to act in the network’s best interests — as a result, there’s a real risk that staking could cause someone to lose crypto instead of earn it. Accidentally waving through an invalid transaction or falling offline can have huge consequences.","['theres', 'eth', 'eth2', 'challenges', 'contract', 'staking', 'downsides', 'beacon', 'validators', 'crypto', 'explained', 'worth', 'funds']","Right now, staking ETH is a significant, long-term commitment.

In the volatile world of cryptocurrency, latency becomes even more important than ever before, as prices can move swiftly in a matter of seconds. Furthermore, extremely low latency will be essential in bringing institutional money into these platforms.

The digital nature of cryptocurrency, not to mention the hype and uncertainty that surrounds the majority of the space, can lead to substantial volatility in crypto markets. Only a few seconds can make a huge difference in how successful a strategy is. More than ever, traders need to know that their trades are being posted as quickly as possible.

Another latency issue that users encounter on cryptocurrency exchanges comes from a lack of standards or uniformity. One exchange may have great infrastructure and speed, while others are lagging behind. This can cause headaches, as many traders interact with multiple platforms, especially arbitrage traders who seek to make a profit from price discrepancies across different markets. These opportunities don’t last long, and having low latency is essential to be able to capitalize on them.

These issues with performance don’t only affect individual human traders. The cryptocurrency space is currently being broken into by institutional investors, and if this trend is going to continue, there needs to be platforms that can cater to high-end customers. Institutions are already expecting the best and fastest services, and only platforms that offer this will be able to attract their business.

This is partly because of a trading technique that is now becoming widely used in the world of digital assets, known as algorithmic trading. Here, trades are made by computers that have been programmed to follow specific strategies. With humans, speed was already essential for being ahead of the competition, but automated trades have pushed this to the extreme and given rise to what is known as high-frequency trading, or HFT.","['speed', 'exchanges', 'low', 'cryptocurrency', 'space', 'platforms', 'trading', 'essential', 'world', 'trades', 'explained', 'important', 'latency', 'traders']","In the volatile world of cryptocurrency, latency becomes even more important than ever before, as prices can move swiftly in a matter of seconds.

While bots can be a great tool for many traders, some are concerned about the ways this could create room for manipulation, such as with “pump and dump” scams as well as decentralized exchange (DEX) manipulation.

Bots can manipulate exchanges

Using a series of bots to bring added liquidity to an exchange sounds harmless enough at first, as it should simply create a better user experience for clients. However, if the vast majority of trading activity on an exchange is bots, then that could be a red-flag that something isn’t right. Using bots to simulate real trading activity in order to make an exchange look more active is known as “wash trading” or “slippage.” It is illegal in traditional markets, but much of the cryptocurrency landscape is still unregulated, so it certainly happens. It has even been speculated that as much as 95% of cryptocurrency volume on some exchanges could be suspect.

There have also been issues with automation on decentralized exchanges, though not just with wash trading. It has been observed that HFT bots have been “front-running” on various DEX’s, a practice where the programs place incrementally higher fees to ensure their trades are given priority. By using an automated, lightning fast system, it becomes impossible for any human player to compete.

Pump and dump scams are common

Another way bots may be hurting cryptocurrency comes in the form of what are known as “pump and dump” scams. Using bots, the scammers basically make it look like one coin or another is beginning a bull run. This doesn’t necessarily have to be that far of aprice move either, as usually these scams occur to small cap coins that haven’t moved much in a while. When regular traders see that the price has risen a bit, it often starts to induce a certain level of FOMO that can then pretty much feed off of itself. Frequently the perpetrators combine this artificial pump with some form of social media campaign as well, to really get people excited. Once the coin has seen sufficient rise, the originators sell and let the market inevitably collapse sooner or later, as the “bull run” was never built on anything but hype and market manipulation.

In a similar vein, “flash crashes” are also an issue. This is when a sudden drop in price can trigger a whole series of bots, further pushing down the selloff, triggering more bots, and this can then create a cascade effect. In May of 2010 an event just like this took place in the stock market, seeing the Dow drop 1,000 points in mere minutes. Ultimately, it was just this sort of runaway automated effect that was found to be the culprit. Not only is cryptocurrency susceptible to this, the previously mentioned fact that it is a much smaller market makes it even more of a likelihood.

Institutions can get unfair advantages

Lastly, there are massive institutional players who also leverage the power of automated trading, but often have an advantage over retail users thanks to something called colocation. Colocation is a service offered by some large firms that allows businesses to rent and host servers at the same site as the exchange with direct connections to the trading systems. This means these clients have the absolute fastest ability to post orders, completely outclassing those without the service. Of course, these accounts can be quite pricey, which can leave many retail investors well behind.","['scams', 'using', 'dump', 'create', 'cryptocurrency', 'pump', 'trading', 'bot', 'bots', 'exchange', 'influences', 'crypto', 'explained', 'market']","However, if the vast majority of trading activity on an exchange is bots, then that could be a red-flag that something isn’t right.

Decentralized exchanges where one trades with a smart contract, not other people

Automated market makers, or AMMs, are a class of decentralized exchanges that rely on mathematical formulas to set the price of a token. Like normal exchanges, they have various trading pairs: for example, Ether (ETH) to Dai.

But there are no buy or sell orders, and traders don’t need to find someone else to sell their coins to. Instead, a smart contract acts as the maker in an exchange transaction. The concept is similar to quick-swap services like ShapeShift and Changelly, but the difference is that the company’s reserves are replaced with liquidity pools based on smart contracts.

A liquidity pool contains two assets in a trading pair. The relative percentage of each token in that pool is what determines the theoretical price of a particular asset. The first live AMM was Bancor, launched in 2017, but the most popular platforms today are Uniswap, Curve, Kyber and Balancer.","['makers', 'liquidity', 'exchanges', 'smart', 'uniswap', 'pool', 'trading', 'contract', 'explained', 'automated', 'price', 'market', 'token', 'sell']","What are automated market makers?

A cross-disciplinary research effort from Cointelegraph Consulting and VeChain provides the answers. This report was the result of a three-month long study, led by the Cointelegraph Consulting research team together with enterprise blockchain professionals from VeChain. In this report, we go beyond utilizing secondary data only — as we are ready to share some unique insights on the future of food safety. Despite the measures taken, the scale of the food safety problem grows globally, costing both developed and emerging economies lives and billions of dollars in losses every year. The report summarized that the lack of 3 key factors — transparency, trust and collaboration within the industry — are the main reason for exacerbation of the problem.

Major food safety incidents happen nearly every year and aren’t limited to underdeveloped countries 2008 — Milk scandal, China

2009 — Peanut butter scandal, USA

2010 — Contaminated green beans scandal, China

2011 — Listeriosis outbreak, USA

2012 — Salmonella outbreak, Netherlands

2013 — Horsemeat scandal, Europe

2014 — McDonald's meat scandal, Asia

2015 — Rotten frozen meat, China

2016 — Chipotle foodborne illness, USA

2017 — Fipronil egg scandal, Europe and Asia

2018 — Listeria outbreak, Australia

2019 — Salmonella-infected chickens, Brasi

In his letter to employees, Bezos said that he would be transitioning to the role of executive chair of the Amazon board, where he would “focus my energies and attention on new products and early initiatives.” The transition is scheduled for later in the year.

Bezos also noted that Jassy “will be an outstanding leader, and has my full confidence.”

The crypto world’s attention now turns to Jassy’s history when it comes to embracing blockchain technology, as it could be an indication of the long-term crypto strategy of the world’s third-most valuable company by market capitalization.

Jassy offered a mixed review of blockchain technology and its applicability to Amazon's business in 2017. In a statement at the Amazon ""re:Invent"" conference, he expressed doubt that blockchain could be used for more than a “distributed ledger” but also said he and his team were personally interested. However, company policy dictated that they don't “build technology [just] because we think it is cool.”

He did leave the door open for future exploration, however, saying, “We are very intrigued by what customers are ultimately going to do there.”

In 2018, Jassy did move forward with a “quasi-blockchain” offering, as he oversaw the launch of two blockchain products: Amazon Quantum Ledger Database and Amazon Managed Blockchain. As Cointelegraph reported, the products maintained centralized databases but included cryptographic qualities.

Aside from these forays, Amazon has largely only made crypto headlines as a scapegoat: In November 2020, Coinbase blamed an AWS outage for one of its frequent service interruptions.

The move marks a major step for the fledgling DeFi sector and more fixed-rate lending protocols in DeFi may attract additional users seeking mostability in longer-term investments and loans, such as mortgages. Currently, the ecosystem is largely populated by yield farmers looking for quick gains on their crypto collateral.

The DeFi engineer attempted the process through TradFi by seeking an offset loan, which directs a savings account’s interest towards paying down a mortgage.

Speaking to The Defiant, however, the borrower stated that banks are very cautious about lending in times of economic uncertainty, especially to those that are self-employed. He added that he had been rejected for a basic credit card for four years.

Notional Finance provides fixed-rate loans for up to six months for users that deposit crypto collateral in wrapped BTC, ETH, wrapped ETH, or DAI.

The approach was far from simple and user-friendly for noobs, however. The engineer had to pay off his bank loan first in AUD. He then had to borrow the USD pegged stablecoin USDC from Notional at a fixed rate, providing his own liquidity to avoid the slippage and fees on the new low volume platform.

He then added around $1 million in wBTC and wETH as collateral to Notional against which he borrowed around $500,000 of USDC which was converted to AUD to pay off the bank. He said:

“I feel like I’m in full control of my situation. People should be all over this stuff.”

Borrowing rates on Notional Finance for USDC are approximately 6% but some of that can be recouped by earnings from liquidity provision. There is the added bonus of maintaining a position in a bull market without having to sell crypto assets and incur a capital gains event upon which there would have been taxes to pay.

He added that the process was fast compared to traditional finance;

“It felt like it would’ve taken months of applications, finding tax returns and bank statements for the bank to refinance me, but I was able to do it all in one day, under my own agency,”

Leading DeFi protocol Aave has also started down the mortgage path with its latest partnership. In an announcement on Feb. 2, Aave stated that the scheme was in collaboration with RealT, a firm that tokenizes real estate in order to allow users to stake their property as collateral to take out loans. The ability to use these assets as collateral is the first step in making “mortgage” loans on Ethereum available to a wider audience.","['mortgage', 'single', 'day', 'loan', 'engineer', 'aussie', 'loans', 'added', 'users', 'usdc', 'defi', 'notional', 'using', 'collateral', 'refinances', 'pioneering', 'bank']","The move marks a major step for the fledgling DeFi sector and more fixed-rate lending protocols in DeFi may attract additional users seeking mostability in longer-term investments and loans, such as mortgages.

Terra is an ambitious stablecoin project from Korea working to combine the stability of fiat currency with the non-censorable nature of cryptocurrency.

Terra-based mobile payments DApp CHAI is also growing in popularity. It cuts down on fiat payment processing fees and provides near instant settlements with numerous Korean merchants.

According to stats tracker dapp.com, the DApp recently surpassed 2.3 million unique users, with almost 63,000 members using the service every 24 hours.

According to Novogratz, Terra’s ability to offer real world solutions with working products sets it apart from most blockchain-based startups.

“What’s great about Terra is they are one of the first sandbox experiments that’s getting outside the sandbox […] We are always looking at those projects because they are the canaries in the coal mines of what else is going to happen.”

Terra is also home to fast-rising DeFi projects like Mirror Protocol, which allows for the trading of stocks, indexes and commodities. The value of liquidity locked in the protocol has almost doubled in the space of two weeks to reach an all-time high of $171.3 million on Feb. 1.

As reported by Techcrunch, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev was quizzed by none other than Elon Musk on invite-only app Clubhouse, where Tenev revealed the extent of the firm’s losses.

According to Tenev, he woke up early on Jan. 28 to find a bill from the National Securities Clearing Corporation for the sum of $3 billion, payable immediately. Providing context for that number, Tenev said:

“Robinhood up until that point has raised around $2 billion in total venture capital. Up until now, so it’s a big number, like $3 billion is a large number, right.”

The Wall Street Journal reported on Feb. 1 that Robinhood had raised another $2.4 billion from investors, taking the total sum of money raised since last Thursday to $3.4 billion. Yet despite apparently having no problems with liquidity, the firm appears to have reasoned that its current public perception would not be conducive to a successful IPO.

Indeed, a vast majority of surveyed professionals believe that Robinhood has ruined its chances of launching an IPO due to its behavior during the recent GameStop saga.

An anonymous survey conducted via the Blind networking forum asked 8,750 verified professionals from major tech and financial services companies if they thought Robinhood had “screwed its IPO”. The results revealed that 83% thought the firm’s chances of a successful initial public offering had been irreparably damaged.

The response given by 37 Robinhood employees surveyed was markedly different. Just 13.5% believe the company has killed the possibility of ever seeing a successful IPO launch, while 86.5% believe it can still go ahead.

A self-effacing comment from a Facebook employee expressed the view that the IPO could still go ahead, but that Robinhood would forever suffer the same negative public opinion as the ubiquitous social media giant. They wrote:

“Robinhood is the next Facebook. Something tons of people will use but has a negative undertone and brand.”

Public opinion soured on Robinhood following the company’s decision to ban retail buy orders in the middle of the Reddit-inspired “short squeeze” on GameStop. Sharp-eyed observers were quick to point out the possible conflict of interest at play given 35% of Robinhood’s revenue came from the same firm which suffered heavy losses at the hands of r/Wallstreetbets organized band of collective traders.

Robinhood has since stated that the only reason it halted retail buy orders was because it couldn’t cover its commitments to the NSCC, which demands that each day’s trading liabilities are covered in full.

The company was contacted for comment, but had not replied by time of publication.","['reportedly', 'gamestop', 'ipo', 'public', 'robinhood', 'plans', 'tenev', 'raised', 'trading', 'shelves', 'wake', 'successful', 'disaster', 'opinion', 'pr', 'billion']","Trading app Robinhood may have put its plans for an initial public offering on hold after public opinion turned against the company in the wake of its response to the short squeeze on GameStop (GME).

According to data from on-chain analytics resource CryptoQuant, the price premium of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) just hit its lowest since April 2019.

Grayscale lock-up ends Wednesday

Grayscale has made the headlines frequently this year thanks to record BTC purchases and record demand, but despite the inflows, BTC/USD has not continued to gain.

As February begins, the Trust’s purchase premium is at around $6.50, having previously been as high as $40 over the course of its existence. This historically coincides with meandering price direction, while large premiums equal large upside moves for Bitcoin.

In late December, a dedicated article in technology magazine Hackernoon explained the phenomenon as being tied to releases of GBTC shares which have been subject to a customary lock-up.

Once they are released, Bitcoin tends to shoot higher as customers put their profits back into BTC, while the time preceding such events corresponds to a lack of price action.

“What's important to know is once these higher prices and premiums are realized after an unlocking, price goes on to consolidate. This lets the premium shrink again before its next unlocking event,” Hackernoon summarized.

With the next unlocking set for Feb. 3, anticipation should be building for a continuation of the Bitcoin bull run.

“This voids enables premiums to shrink again just like the nine times before,” the article continued, correctly predicting the price behavior for the second half of January.

“And it'll keep shrinking until the next unlocking. Because of this I expect price to either consolidate or sag.”

Doge doing what it does best, welcoming people into crypto with a huge slap in the face. https://t.co/0GpiKe4B8U — RyanJK (@RJ_Kunz) January 30, 2021

Just yesterday, Dogecoin made history for cracking the top 10 cryptoassets by marketcap for the first time since 2015. The currency named after a dog meme that was started as a joke was propelled to such lofty heights on the back of similarly record-breaking social media volume, according to analytics provided by The TIE.

While some tied the rapid price appreciation to Elon Musk memes and the inevitable groupthink of crypto’s often momentum-based markets, $DOGE’s success may also be rooted in anti-establishment sentiments running rife through the retail crowd following popular trading app Robinhood disabling ‘Buy’ orders for certain assets.

The move from Robinhood and other brokers prompted furious accusations of hypocrisy and speculation that hedge funds were being favored over smaller investors — and what's a better way to highlight a broken system than pumping a joke coin to a multi-billion dollar valuation?

However, after reports of withdrawal issues on multiple centralized exchanges, Dogecoin has undergone a violent overnight reversal, leading many buyers to take to social media to express their regret. Just a few hours after posting that she’d “finally caved and bought the dog stock,” podcast host and media personality Mia Khalifa indicated some buyer’s remorse:

However, the new coin appears to be the latest in a series of jokes played by the CoinMarketCap team. The coin’s page on CMC features the following message:

“All UR MeMes R belong to us and Charmander-marth!!11. We seek alpha and master beta. Please note that this is a joke and no such asset exists. If you see similarly-named projects, please perform the requisite due diligence and do not ape in.”

The reference to Charmander-marth links to a YouTube video featuring Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya being interviewed by CNBC regarding his successful trading of GameStop stocks during the short-squeeze initiated by the r/Wallstreetbets subreddit.

The coin’s CMC page offers up a brief timeline of the GameStop saga, describing the short-squeeze tactic and the subsequent effect it had on the Robinhood trading app, which suspended retail trading for GameStop and several other stocks, including AMC, Nokia and Blackberry.

Clicking the link to the coin’s white paper links to the Twitter page of ""MuzlM_Trader,"" whose tweet also drew attention to Chamath Palihapitiya’s appearance on CNBC.

Once the massive pump lost momentum and traders quickly took profits, it seemed that investors would move on past the meme-based cryptocurrency and find something else to invest in.

The pump initially started when exchanges prevented retail traders from buying more GameStop and AMC stock on Jan. 28. Fueled by the Reddit discussion group r/Wallstreetbets, the army of investors turned their attention to silver and a selection of ‘cheap’ cryptocurrenceis.

On Jan.28, Twitter user ""WSB Chairman"" asked, ""Has Doge ever been to a dollar?"" to his 750,000 followers. That was enough to trigger the monster rally, despite Dogecoin having no protocol upgrades or developments since 2015.

The 68% retracement that followed the peak at $0.087 resembled Bitcoin's (BTC) sharp drop after the December 2017 crash, except this time around, instead of 50 days, it took only 24 hours.

Multiple social media influencers and streamers expressed their discontent at buying the top, an indication that the momentary speculative frenzy had passed. After spending most of Jan. 30 and Jan. 31 hovering around $0.03, DOGE managed to produce another 80% pump in less than three hours.

It's almost impossible to find the exact trigger for those events, as there are multiple social networks, including private Telegram groups and trading signal apps.

Reddit's r/SatoshiStreetBets currently has 213,000 active users and following DOGE’s breakout a meme-post by user Woke_AF_Populist quickly climbed to its most upvoted list.

There seems to be endless support from the Dogecoin fanbase, including Tesla's CEO and founder Elon Musk. The lack of a concrete use case for the meme-coin certainly raises the question of whether members of r/WallStreetBets will jump ship from traditional markets and embrace the generally unregulated ethos of the cryptocurrency sector.

DOGE to $1?

Data from Cointelegraph Markets, CoinMarketCap and Tradingview showed a transformation taking place in the DOGE ecosystem overnight on Jan. 27, with DOGE/USD hitting $0.0138.

In a matter of hours on Thursday, the pair added over 80% to its spot price before correcting, still holding 1 cent support at the time of writing.

The gains accompanied a similar surge in interest on social media, with Twitter activity up by more than 300%. The source, it appears, is the same Reddit group that sparked a dramatic but highly controversial bull run in the stock price of U.S. consumer electronics firm GameStop.

Dogecoin already has something in common with $GME, both assets having seen publicity tweets from Tesla CEO and world's richest man, Elon Musk in recent weeks. As Cointelegraph reported, Musk's tongue-in-cheek endorsement of DOGE was enough to induce serious price action.

The most-traded Bitcoin product in centralized exchanges is Bitcoin futures, which is 10 times bigger than spot trading in terms of the trading volume. But on DEXs, spot trading platforms, such as Uniswap, occupy a large portion of the total trading volume, and there is not a single decentralized futures trading platform that could reach even one-10th of Uniswap’s trading volume. What stops decentralized futures trading platforms from becoming 10 times bigger than Uniswap? Why are decentralized futures trading platforms performing worse than their centralized counterparts?

The main reason is that decentralized futures exchanges don’t currently provide an attractive futures product to compete with centralized futures exchanges. For instance, centralized futures exchanges, such as BitMEX, can provide 100 times leverage on Bitcoin futures trading. On the other hand, decentralized futures exchanges, such as dYdX, only offer 10 times leverage. None of the decentralized exchanges can keep up with the 100x leverage offering from centralized exchanges.

YFX Descartes V1 uses QIC-AMM and a system de-risk mechanism to migrate perpetual futures trading from CEXs to DEXs without reducing the trading leverage, which makes YFX the first DEX that could offer 100x leverage on a perpetual contract. You can do everything on YFX you normally do on BitMEX or OKEx. YFX is poised to compete directly against established centralized exchanges. YFX Descartes V1 runs on both Huobi Heco Chain and Tron for faster transaction times and cheaper gas fees compared to Ethereum. The YFX team is also working on Ethereum’s layer-two solution to provide pragmatic perpetual trading on DEXs. The YFX team plans to launch its DEX on the Ethereum testnet in Q1, 2021.

About YFX

YFX is the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts. YFX Descartes V1 launched on both Huobi Heco Chain and Tron, and all trades are held and processed by smart contracts. The main goal of the YFX team, which consists of engineers who have years of experience working on trading systems and blockchain technology, is to build a DEX that can compete with CEXs on derivative trading.

The latest changes to the platform consist of the full rollout of a gift card feature and the integration of MoonPay, which has improved users’ capability of purchasing crypto with fiat-based bank cards.

After a trial run starting late last year, Freewallet has now fully launched a gift card feature aimed at making its users’ lives easier from an e-commerce perspective. With the new feature, users can now buy gift cards for online and brick-and-mortar businesses with any cryptocurrency supported by the platform. The process is simple and can be completed in just a few minutes.

To make the feature possible, Freewallet has partnered with over 800+ brands from around the world, including Amazon, eBay, iTunes and many more. The feature comes with a search tool that allows users to organize their options according to popularity or alphabetical order and includes offerings from a wide variety of stores covering a whole spectrum of consumer needs — including beauty and lifestyle, booksellers, department stores, electronics, entertainment, food and drink, home and DIY, jewelers, leisure and sports, men’s fashion, supermarkets, toys and games, travel and women’s fashion.

These gift cards make the perfect gift option for crypto enthusiasts looking to do something special for their friends and loved ones, and it’s even a great way to treat themselves without having to use fiat. Each gift card can range in value from $1–$1,000, depending on the user’s preference.

The gift card feature is just one of the recent changes to be introduced to the platform. Another significant development has been the integration of MoonPay, one of the industry’s premier fiat-to-crypto transaction facilitators. By bringing in MoonPay, Freewallet has enhanced its purchase-with-card function. Now users can use any of the 42 major fiat currencies supported by MoonPay to purchase Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Chiliz (CHZ), Litecoin (LTC), Stellar (XLM), USD Coin (USDC), EOS, Tron (TRX), NEO, Dai, VeChain (VET), Zilliqa (ZIL), TrueUSD (TUSD), 0x (ZRX), Paxos Standard Token (PAX), Decentraland (MANA), Civic (CVC), EOSDT and USDT20.

These changes are the result of the continuous dialogue between the Freewallet development team and its community. As the platform continues to grow, it has made it a priority to become an all-inclusive crypto hub for its users. Freewallet prides itself on pairing groundbreaking technology with intuitive simplicity.

Solomon Brown, head of PR at Freewallet, had this to say about the changes: “We are really pleased that we can introduce more useful features for our users. We have been quite lucky in that we have been able to gather a large community around our platform and listen to the feedback they provide us with. It is amazing to see both the strides that we have taken as a service and the progress being made in the industry as a whole. We hope that our users will enjoy the new gift card feature as well as the retooled exchange.”

Founded in 2017, the company has built its services around a network of distributed resources that own and profit off unused hardware. Cudos clients can, therefore, harness cloud computing resources securely and at a much lower price as opposed to centralized alternatives. On the other hand, hardware owners are incentivized to share their computing resources in order to provide end-customers with low-latency and cost-effective resources.

The company has since launched the Cudos Network, an exciting endeavor into the blockchain technology market. Aware that high-performance blockchains must access off-chain computing resources, the Cudos Network bridges the gap between cloud computing and blockchain ledgers in a decentralized, secure and incentivizing manner. Over the long term, this will foster innovation across the blockchain space, as project developers will build more performant blockchains that rely on layer-two computations for innovative use cases. The process has already started as Cudos has partnered up with numerous companies in the tech space, including AMD, PlayStation Partners, Verne Global, Outlier Ventures, Sapphire, NexGen Cloud and others.

Cudos token listing on KuCoin

This cloud computing framework is unified under a common standard via Cudos, a utility token that provides access to worthwhile revenue streams within the Cudos Network. After being oversubscribed in the presale and raising over $10 million, the project is now listing Cudos on KuCoin.

Once the listing is live, KuCoin traders will have the opportunity to access a staking mechanism designed to reward users who choose to lock up their tokens for a limited timeframe. It’s imperative to keep in mind that the Cudos Network has its own staking system, which is a prerequisite to becoming an incentivized validator node, earning up to 30% of their stake per annum. Rewards are also available via the delegated staking program, which distributes rewards to users who fail to accumulate the 2-million staking minimum. Cudos ownership is necessary to access cloud compute jobs, representing an all-around access ticket to the Cudos ecosystem.

Cudos value potential grows

Cudos isn’t only listed on KuCoin, however. In fact, the token was first listed as part of a primary listing event on BitMax, only to be later listed on Poloniex as well. Trade analysis shows impressive price gains following the initial listing, thereby highlighting Cudos’ potential as a rewarding utility token. To put this into perspective, the Cudos strategic funding phase debuted at $0.006 per token and managed to attain a $0.12 appreciation as soon as the token was listed on the public market, highlighting a 2,000% rise.

Now trading at an average of $0.07, Cudos is certainly generating considerable hype for cloud computing enthusiasts. As expected, Cudos’ initial investors have been greatly rewarded following the recent price increases, consolidating the idea that people believe in the project’s utility and value proposition for the blockchain market.

Exploring the Cudos tokenomics

The Cudos token is hard-capped at 10 billion coins, with most of the funds raised via the token sales destined to fund the platform’s development, marketing strategy, validator nodes and customer acquisition efforts.

In the foreseeable future, the Cudos token will find itself listed on a growing number of cryptocurrency exchanges, facilitating profit-seeking trades between compatible crypto pairs. At this time, the token is available for purchase and sale via the CUDOS/USDT pair. More trading pairs will be added in the near future.

The CUDOS/USDT trading pair will debut trading at 10:00 on Feb. 2, 2021.

In an interview with Forbes, Mayor Francis Suarez said tangible paths to expand Bitcoin's adoption throughout the city included enabling city employee salaries to be paid in BTC.

Major figures in the cryptocurrency world have responded positively to the idea, with Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey calling it “smart” on Twitter.

Germini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss stated that the mayor is “leading the way for governments and Bitcoin.”

Mayor Suarez told Forbes that due to the rise in crypto’s popularity among citizens, he wants to do everything he can to make Miami a Bitcoin-friendly city. Other proposals include allowing local fees and taxes to be paid in Bitcoin and certain other cryptocurrencies, as well as investing some of the city’s treasury into Bitcoin, following Microstrategy’s example.

Although he isn’t sure of specific amounts, Suarez explained that the treasury investment would be structured as a public-private partnership, with the private partners receiving some of the rewards for alleviating some of the risks.

He also revealed that he’s also considering financing his reelection campaign in Bitcoin. He isn’t the first to turn to Bitcoin to help fund political campaigns with Democrat Andrew Yang, California U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell, Minnesota U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer, and Libertarian Lara Loomer among U.S. politicians who have already accepted cryptocurrencies in past campaigns.

The mayor believes Bitcoin will be the “biggest story for the next few years.”

Late last year the mayor called Bitcoin a “stable investment” during an “incredibly unstable year.” Last week, he uploaded Bitcoin’s whitepaper onto the government’s website saying:

“The City of Miami believes in Bitcoin and I’m working day and night to turn Miami into a hub for crypto innovation.”

The mayor told Forbes that he has reached out to other states and jurisdictions, including Caitlin Long in Wyoming and Florida CFO Jimmy Patronis to help drive Bitcoin-friendly changes in Florida’s legislature. These efforts are part of the city’s push to be the next major tech hub in the U.S. with plans to grow innovation and tech growth in the next few years.

Should these actions take effect, Miami’s 450,000 citizens may be encouraged to start transacting in Bitcoin on a regular basis, with the potential for this to spread to the rest of Florida’s 21.5 million residents. It would also make the city more attractive for blockchain-related tech companies and events.

Although Miami may be the first U.S. city to offer employees salaries in Bitcoin, other companies have also been exploring this. Last week, Cointelegraph reported that software development services provider Sequoia Holdings, based in Virginia, is offering employees the ability to sacrifice a portion of their salary to invest in either Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), or Ether (ETH).","['paid', 'forbes', 'salaries', 'mayor', 'tech', 'employees', 'suarez', 'city', 'bitcoin', 'miami', 'able']","Miami city employees could soon choose to get their salaries paid in Bitcoin rather than USD.

Multiple metrics like the increasing amount of Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) locked in DeFi, soaring transaction and on-chain activity and the plummeting BTC and Ether reserves of top exchanges show that investors are becoming increasingly interested in cryptocurrency.

Data from CryptoQuant, an on-chain analytics firm, shows that as Ether (ETH) established a new all-time high above $1,500 on Feb. 2, the amount of Ether held on all centralized exchange’s reserves continued to drop to new lows as token holders withdrew their coins.

Many analysts believe that the rapidly expanding DeFi sector, launch of Eth2 and increasing participation from institutional investors are the primary reasons for the drop in BTC and Ether held on centralized exchanges.

The rise of DeFi and yield farming

Each week the number of participants interacting with the DeFi sector seems to reach a new high and as of Feb. 2, the total value locked in DeFi platforms has reached $28.67 billion.

Total value locked in DeFi. Source: Defi Pulse

Data from Defi Pulse shows that the majority of DeFi platforms are built on the Ethereum network and require Ether to transact with the protocol.

In addition to offering attractive ways to earn a yield from simply lending Ether, an increasing amount of the available supply is being directed towards DeFi-related activities and not available for trading purposes.

A similar phenomenon is happening with BTC as holders looking to participate in the DeFi space without selling their Bitcoin have been wrapping them into ERC-20 synthetic versions of Ether.

Platforms like REN and BadgerDAO lead in this effort and a similar drain on the available Bitcoin supply could also be helping to push the price of BTC higher.

Eth2 and extended lock-up staking

Since the launch of the Beacon chain on Dec. 1, 2020, the Eth2 contract has enabled token holders to stake their Ether in the new PoS contract by becoming validators for the network.

Data from the Eth2 Launch Pad shows that there are currently 2,907,298 Ether worth a total of $4.39 billion staked on the network earning an estimated APR of 9.2%

The contract has a multi-year commitment but for holders who refuse to stomach the risk and volatility of DeFi yield farming, Eth2 staking offers a way to earn a yield over time rather than let tokens sit on exchanges or in cold wallets.

Institutional investors begin to see the value proposition of Ether

Since 2020, Bitcoin has received the lion’s share of attention from the institutional investment crowd as investors like MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor lead the way by buying up immense sums of Bitcoin and tweeting non-stop about its estimated future value.

Now that Bitcoin is more than a decade old and seen as more established, firms are increasingly open to looking for the next big opportunity that the cryptocurrency sector has to offer. With the explosion of DeFi and its current dependence on the Ethereum network, Ether is quickly becoming a recommended choice for the institutional investors.

Grayscale Investments temporarily closed their various crypto trusts to new investments in late December following the rise in the price of Bitcoin, but inflow resumed in early January and their total Ether holdings have increased by 242% over the past 3 months.

Coinbase also noted in its annual 2020 review that institutional investors are increasingly seeing Ether as a store of value with “a growing number” of its institutional clients taking a position in the token due to the strong returns offered.

The exchange also noted that while a majority of their clients bought BTC throughout 2020, Ether’s strong finish to the year saw it surpass BTC in terms of price growth and this is a trend which has continued into 2021.

Ark Invest’s latest report, ""Bitcoin: Preparing for Institutions,"" shows that even a paltry allocation of 1% by companies from the S&P 500 could boost Bitcoin’s price by $40,000. However, analysts at Ar believe that the allocation is likely to be in the range of 2.5% to 6.5%, which ""could impact bitcoin’s price by $200,000 to $500,000.""

Even as Bitcoin’s price consolidates and readies for the next leg up, several altcoins have been rising, backed by strong fundamentals and investors' high expectations of their upcoming products. Let’s look at three such tokens today.

BAND/USD

The decentralized finance space has boomed in the past few months, and the success of the protocols rely heavily upon data sources that are decentralized, fast and reliable. This is where Band Protocol steps in. The cross-chain data oracle has announced several partnerships in the past few days, which shows it is gradually building its market share.

The strong rally in stocks such as GameStop, AMC and others have captured traders' attention in the past few days. Band’s tie-up with Injective Protocol to deliver decentralized price oracles for various stocks to be supported on the decentralized derivatives platform could benefit the price of its native token, BAND, as a successful integration would be followed by an increase in demand.

Similarly, Linear Finance, a derivatives asset protocol, will also use Band’s real-time price feeds to offer its clients a seamless trading experience for several synthetic assets.

Band is not limited to only providing price feeds of cryptocurrencies, foreign exchange assets and commodities. Elrond and Band have expanded their partnership further to bridge the two networks to provide off-chain data to various applications being developed on the Elrond network. Other than the usual price feeds, Band will also cater to data requests for sports, gaming, esports and much more.

Along with these, Band has also entered into partnerships with the Moonbeam protocol, Nervos and Fantom in the past few days and broadened its existing partnership with CoinGecko.

BAND price rose from $7.1532 on Jan. 22 to $12.949 on Tuesday, an 81% rally within a short time. Previous to this move, the price had largely been stuck in the range of $7 to $11.50 for the past few days.

BAND/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls pushed the price above the range on Tuesday, but the long wick on the day’s candlestick shows the bears are aggressively selling at higher levels. This has dragged the price back into the aforementioned trading range.

If the bulls do not give up much ground, then one more attempt to break above the range is likely. The 20-day exponential moving average ($9.28) has started to turn up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive territory, which suggests that the path of least resistance is to the upside.

If the bulls can drive and sustain the price above $11.50, the BAND/USD pair could rally to $16 and then to $17.78. This zone may act as stiff resistance, but if the bulls can propel the price above it, the momentum could further pick up.

Contrary to this assumption, if the bears successfully defend the $11.50–$12.949 resistance zone, the pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.

LRC/USD

The GameStop saga and the trading limits imposed on retail traders by brokerages like Robinhood have exposed their significant flaws. This is likely to draw traders to decentralized exchanges where control does not lie with any central entity.

Transaction fees are an extremely important aspect during trading, especially for smaller-sized traders. So, when Ethereum gas fees increase, these retail traders are the most affected. Loopring attempts to solve this problem with it layer-two scaling.

Data from Dune Analytics shows that Loopring’s fee collection recently surged to its highest-ever level due to increasing volume. The protocol recently updated its LRC tokenomics model and announced a new fee distribution pattern to its various participants. This could further attract LRC investors who may want to benefit from the rising popularity of the protocol.

LRC rose from an intraday low at $0.33651 on Jan. 22 to an intraday high at $0.57618 on Jan. 31, a 71% rally within a few days. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls are in control.

LRC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The up-move is currently facing resistance near $0.55, and the LRC/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($0.43). This is an important level to watch out for because the pair has taken support at the 20-day EMA on three previous occasions.

If the pair again rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $0.62167. If they succeed, the pair could rally to $0.71773 and then to $0.78.

This bullish view will invalidate if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that the bulls are not buying the dips anymore, and that could result in a fall to $0.35 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($0.31).

CREAM/USD

Certain aspects of traditional finance could act as an inspiration to build projects in the decentralized space. Cream Finance recently announced the launch of Iron Bank, which is guided by the success of the $10-trillion U.S. corporate debt market.

While there are several peer-to-peer lending protocols existing in the crypto space, Cream has taken it a step further and created a protocol-to-protocol lending mechanism. The main attraction of the Iron Bank is that it will facilitate zero-collateral lending.

To keep the risk under check, Cream will set a credit limit after whitelisting the protocols. Initially, the Iron Bank is available only for Cream’s partners, but if this project succeeds, it is likely to be a huge positive for the entire DeFi space.

In other news, Cream recently widened its services by adding SushiSwap and Uniswap LP tokens as collateral options for lending and borrowing.

The platform's CREAM token rallied from $119.35 on Jan. 22 to an intraday high at $319.9 on Tuesday, a 168% rally within a short time. The long wick on the day’s candlestick shows that traders aggressively booked profits at higher levels.

CREAM/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the bulls do not allow the price to dip below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $251.65, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. The upsloping 20-day EMA ($181) and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest the advantage to the bulls.

If the bulls can push and sustain the price above $294.80, the CREAM/USD pair could rally to $362 and then to $430.

Conversely, if the bears sink the price below $251.65, the pair could dip to the 61.8% retracement level at $209.45.

“Buy crypto” searches on Google surged to all-time highs in January, far exceeding the previous peak of early 2018, according to cryptocurrency analytics company The Tie.

Relative search interest for the term ""Buy Crypto"" is at all-time high on Google Trends pic.twitter.com/4cFIkI0xbp — The TIE (@TheTIEIO) February 1, 2021

The keyword received a perfect Google Trends score of 100, which indicates maximum relative interest.

A similar spike was also observed for Ethereum, which achieved a perfect score of 100 before falling back down to a still-strong 65.

Bitcoin (BTC) searches also spiked, but remain well below the 2017 bull market high.

The Tie also shared the following chart with Cointelegraph, which highlights a sharp rise in searches for “best crypto app” and “best crypto exchange.”

“Relative search interest for popular crypto terms is at an all-time high on Google Trends,” Treyce Dahlem, research analyst at The Tie, to Cointelegraph.

He continued:

“Whether this is due to the recent price rallies that we’ve seen, speculative traders from Reddit looking to leave their mark on more assets, or even a macro shift in the way investors are searching for a hedge against inflation, one thing is clear: There is a rapidly growing interest in crypto and new investors are looking for the best way to get into the ecosystem.”

The explosive search trends seem to coincide with growing retail interest in both Ethereum and altcoins. Ether’s (ETH) price has doubled since the start of the year, having just reached a new all-time high above $1,500.

Meanwhile, the overall cryptocurrency market in January reached $1 trillion for the first time. While the initial spike was largely due to Bitcoin, altcoins have supported the trillion-dollar valuation with greater intensity over the past month. In the process, Bitcoin’s dominance rate has fallen to 62% from a high of 72% in early January.

Google search trends are sometimes correlated with movements in the overall cryptocurrency market. Higher relative searches signal growing retail awareness of digital assets, which is often a precursor to wider speculative adoption.

The Tie revealed to Cointelegraph that social media engagement surrounding crypto has also skyrocketed. On Twitter, aggregate tweet volumes devoted to cryptocurrency reached 3.3 million in January, up from 1.3 million in September 2020. January’s aggregate tweet volume was 181% higher than a year earlier.","['tie', 'cryptocurrency', 'crypto', 'interest', 'google', 'trends', 'search', 'hit', 'searches', 'record', 'high', 'alltime', 'buy']","If Google search trends are anything to go by, crypto euphoria appears to be on the rise again, according to new industry research.

According to an announcement from Cash App, its clearing broker, Axos, halted the app’s ability to complete purchases of stocks for GameStop, AMC Entertainment, Nokia and Koss Corporation — at least four of the stocks pushed by retail investors on the r/Wallstreetbets subreddit in their fight against hedge funds’ shorts. However, the app later tweeted that the broker has restored trading for AMC and Nokia.

Cash App initially said that it “wholeheartedly” disagreed with Axos’ actions and added that it would attempt to allow users to purchase all the affected stocks “as soon as possible.” The platform has not mentioned any change in the status of trading GameStop and Koss Corporation stocks, but the price of GME fell under $100 for the first time in a week, reaching $99.50 at the time of publication.

Though it appeared that Cash App was trying to distance itself from any possible allegations of market manipulation in the wake of the GameStop short sells, the restrictions on buys were similar to those imposed by other trading apps last week.

Robinhood announced on Thursday that it had suspended buying for GameStop stock and others after many of the stocks surged. The trading app has since lowered these restrictions, but its users are still limited to buying one GME share as of yesterday.

Many on social media seemed to place the blame for restricting trading on Axos rather than Cash App, but they still expressed their frustration after the parallels with Robinhood.

“Thank you for the transparency,” said Twitter user Phoenix Williams. “Robinhood was under the same situation but they chose to lie.”

The excitement surrounding this project has electrified several major Chinese cities, as well as onlookers throughout the world.

Most recently, Shenzhen launched its “iShenzhen” lottery, wherein the city government will distribute 20 million digital yuan among 100,000 central bank digital currency, or CBDC, wallet holders. This comes on the back of a similar lottery held in the city of Suzhou, one of China’s major “special economic zones.” Suzhou has already engaged with several blockchain projects in an effort to deepen the municipality’s understanding and use of decentralized technology, smart contracts and the general learning curve the local population may face.

Related: China turns up pace on CBDC release, tests infrastructure prior to adoption

As China continues to cement itself in the international economy, it is proving to be a leader in the race toward CBDC adoption, an initiative that would make Chinese goods and services more accessible within the global marketplace. Many experts in the fields of fiscal policy and financial technology have argued that the digitization of public money is an inevitable consequence of distributed ledger technology.

The particular political and economic ramifications of this switch to digital currency will depend on the specific decisions of governments regarding their approaches to these new technologies. China, for example, has adopted an approach that has seen repeated success throughout contemporary business culture.

A number of other nations, with economies of all sizes, are more or less waiting in the wings as the People’s Bank of China demonstrates its leadership. In the Suzhou and Shenzhen experiments, citizens are allotted digital yuan and encouraged to link their digital wallets to their existing PBoC accounts, and if they do not use the digital currency within a few weeks, it disappears.

Nations are especially eager to see how this program unfolds and how adoption looks at the grassroots level. Businesses and governments have a natural incentive to embrace this technology, as it reduces overhead and friction, which enhances their bottom line. However, for citizens whose motives might not be tied to financial gain, which other incentives will prompt them to start using an entirely different system of money and banking? These aforementioned adoption trends will be a key driver that determines how quickly other nations will begin developing their own CBDCs.

Related: Did CBDCs affect the crypto space in 2020, and what’s next in 2021? Experts answer

Smaller nations have a better chance for quicker launches

This experiment has excited economic participation within China and roused interest from public banks across the world. Which countries have positioned themselves to follow China into the digital future? Certainly, China’s influence, as well as a long-standing pro-technology culture throughout the continent, suggests that many East Asian countries may follow suit. The Bank of Thailand launched a CBDC pilot program back in June 2020. Moreover, just last fall, the Bank of Korea announced plans for a 2021 CBDC issuance, while Japanese banking officials have articulated a more cautious, passive course of interest following China’s CBDC.

Smaller nations, of course, have a different set of obstacles in their financial experimentation. Recently, the Bahamas introduced its “Sand Dollar” and Cambodia its “Bakong,” following China’s example. This is made possible, however, by the smaller size of these national banking systems that allow them to move with greater agility as well as a degree of autonomy. This becomes an advantage for smaller nations, as the global dependence on their currency is also smaller, so the interoperability issues are of a lesser priority than for global economies like the United States and China where it becomes a highly critical aspect.

However, larger nations are also showing greater interest. A year-long research report published recently by the central banks of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates shows that the early adoption of digital currencies is favorable — particularly for major economies that have operated with relatively higher degrees of autonomy, unlike those in the eurozone or a part of the North American Free Trade Association, for example. Like China, the Saudi and Emirati governments, given their manufacturing and natural resources, do not accrue as much debt as is standard in other major economies in the West.

This brings to light an interesting aspect of CBDC adoption, one that may influence the process of digitization across the world’s public banks. While a huge number of factors determine how and when a particular economy may adopt digital currency — such as its size, the preexisting economic landscape, its gross domestic product, etc. — an important aspect seems to be a strong national (as opposed to global) economic program. This is interesting not only because it flags particular nations as being predisposed to CBDCs but also because it highlights the importance of interoperability after a currency has been instituted. These digitization programs, in other words, will be brought about through strong national economic policy control, but in order to uphold the global systems that we live in, these technologies will need to interact through intermediary programs.

Interoperability is highly critical for major economies

With a push to all the global CBDC initiatives, the Bank of International Settlements’ Innovation Hub, or BISIH, announced that CBDC research is a top priority for it in 2021. It plans to gauge the feasibility of faster, cheaper cross-border payments. This initiative is going to be highly beneficial for global economies exploring the interoperability of their own CBDC projects using BISIH research and pilot tests to facilitate their own CBDC program and by working with them for all settlements and cross-border payment concerns.

While focusing on domestic use cases is understandable for individual countries, CBDCs will only ever operate in local sandboxes unless there is some type of interoperable protocol. It is critical to bridge the gaps between the various CBDC initiatives and existing payments systems as well as other digital currencies to ensure their success on a global scale.

While governments exploring the use of CBDCs is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, truly borderless, global commerce will be powered with the help of an interoperable protocol, as our economic system is too multifaceted to be replaced by a singular currency.

The move marks a major step for the fledgling DeFi sector and more fixed-rate lending protocols in DeFi may attract additional users seeking mostability in longer-term investments and loans, such as mortgages. Currently, the ecosystem is largely populated by yield farmers looking for quick gains on their crypto collateral.

The DeFi engineer attempted the process through TradFi by seeking an offset loan, which directs a savings account’s interest towards paying down a mortgage.

Speaking to The Defiant, however, the borrower stated that banks are very cautious about lending in times of economic uncertainty, especially to those that are self-employed. He added that he had been rejected for a basic credit card for four years.

Notional Finance provides fixed-rate loans for up to six months for users that deposit crypto collateral in wrapped BTC, ETH, wrapped ETH, or DAI.

The approach was far from simple and user-friendly for noobs, however. The engineer had to pay off his bank loan first in AUD. He then had to borrow the USD pegged stablecoin USDC from Notional at a fixed rate, providing his own liquidity to avoid the slippage and fees on the new low volume platform.

He then added around $1 million in wBTC and wETH as collateral to Notional against which he borrowed around $500,000 of USDC which was converted to AUD to pay off the bank. He said:

Leading DeFi protocol Aave has also started down the mortgage path with its latest partnership. In an announcement on Feb. 2, Aave stated that the scheme was in collaboration with RealT, a firm that tokenizes real estate in order to allow users to stake their property as collateral to take out loans. The ability to use these assets as collateral is the first step in making “mortgage” loans on Ethereum available to a wider audience.","['using', 'pioneering', 'single', 'aussie', 'loan', 'defi', 'notional', 'loans', 'usdc', 'collateral', 'added', 'refinances', 'bank', 'engineer', 'day', 'users', 'mortgage']","The move marks a major step for the fledgling DeFi sector and more fixed-rate lending protocols in DeFi may attract additional users seeking mostability in longer-term investments and loans, such as mortgages.

Nic Carter, a former Fidelity crypto asset analyst and Castle Island Ventures partner, slammed the Wall Street Journal article titled “Behind the Bitcoin Bubble” by Andy Kessler, alleging that it verged on “journalistic malpractice”.

“Normally, if you are a columnist writing in one of the most respected financial publications, you might try and evaluate the data behind that claim, instead of just uncritically accepting it. But Mr. Kessler did no such thing. He just blindly repeated a fanciful claim from an anonymous blogger in order to imply that Bitcoin’s price was somehow dependent on Tether.”

The award-winning WSJ writer based some of his fairly extensive criticism on the work of a blogger called “CryptoAnon” in a viral post called “The Bit Short: Inside Crypto’s Doomsday Machine”. Kessler wrote the blogger had ""found that as much as two-thirds of Bitcoin buys on any given day were purchased with Tether"" based on CoinLib data.

Raising questions over Tether and its lack of audits and the idea USDT was being employed to buy Bitcoin to ""jack up its price,"" Kessler added;

“Normally I wouldn’t care. Bitcoin is nothing, it’s vapor, a concept of an idea. Transactions using Bitcoin are few and far between. It’s not a store of value—anything that drops 30% in a week can’t play that role.”

Kessler said he must also note that ""wallet provider Coinbase, the largest holder of Bitcoin, says it 'does not support USDT.' Do they know something? (Coinbase offers its own stablecoin USDC, in partnership with Circle.)

Carter, who is now board chair at Coin Metrics, wrote that assessing trade between USDT and Bitcoin using data called CoinLib was “indefensible” as it included tens of billions of wash trading data from exchanges that reputable data sources ignore.

He said any serious trader knows that “many of the exchanges composing the CoinLib sample are not credible, and that the resultant data was thus completely unreliable.”

“As I will demonstrate, this data is not sufficient to make the case that Bitcoin liquidity is dominated by Tether, and relying on it is liable to mislead. Unfortunately, the mainstream financial press is now amplifying these erroneous claims.”

Carter stated that CoinLib is taking the data outputs from marginal and often non-fiat connected Tether based exchanges as face value, and “unsophisticated analysts like CryptoAnon” are using it to disseminate FUD about Bitcoin’s liquidity.

He argued that highly regulated exchanges and institutional fund providers do not rely on or even support Tether in some cases and they all facilitate an on-ramp to Bitcoin and support the price.

“Other entities like Cash App, Paxos, Paypal, BlockFi, Robinhood, Bitwise, and Grayscale all facilitate various forms of exposure to Bitcoin and are connected to the commercial bank system and in some cases publicly-traded companies. No Tether present.”

Carter concludes that Kessler needs more research and called for a retraction and a correction by the WSJ:

“Wild theories relying on data that everyone in the crypto industry knows to be erroneous do no one any good.”","['wsjs', 'coin', 'aim', 'bitcoin', 'using', 'kessler', 'support', 'usdt', 'fud', 'coinlib', 'exchanges', 'called', 'takes', 'data', 'metrics', 'tether', 'cofounder']","The co-founder of crypto data and insights firm Coin Metrics has fired back at yet another article in mainstream media claiming that the “Bitcoin bubble” has been driven by Tether.

According to Fox Business Network’s Charles Gasparino, sources inside Robinhood say the company’s only focus is surviving the fallout from the drama it currently finds itself engulfed in, and will pause its plans for an IPO launch for now.

Execs say they have access to even more capital than additional amounts raised today. More @TeamCavuto 1230pm — Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) February 1, 2021

As reported by Techcrunch, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev was quizzed by none other than Elon Musk on invite-only app Clubhouse, where Tenev revealed the extent of the firm’s losses.

According to Tenev, he woke up early on Jan. 28 to find a bill from the National Securities Clearing Corporation for the sum of $3 billion, payable immediately. Providing context for that number, Tenev said:

“Robinhood up until that point has raised around $2 billion in total venture capital. Up until now, so it’s a big number, like $3 billion is a large number, right.”

The Wall Street Journal reported on Feb. 1 that Robinhood had raised another $2.4 billion from investors, taking the total sum of money raised since last Thursday to $3.4 billion. Yet despite apparently having no problems with liquidity, the firm appears to have reasoned that its current public perception would not be conducive to a successful IPO.

Indeed, a vast majority of surveyed professionals believe that Robinhood has ruined its chances of launching an IPO due to its behavior during the recent GameStop saga.

An anonymous survey conducted via the Blind networking forum asked 8,750 verified professionals from major tech and financial services companies if they thought Robinhood had “screwed its IPO”. The results revealed that 83% thought the firm’s chances of a successful initial public offering had been irreparably damaged.

The response given by 37 Robinhood employees surveyed was markedly different. Just 13.5% believe the company has killed the possibility of ever seeing a successful IPO launch, while 86.5% believe it can still go ahead.

A self-effacing comment from a Facebook employee expressed the view that the IPO could still go ahead, but that Robinhood would forever suffer the same negative public opinion as the ubiquitous social media giant. They wrote:

“Robinhood is the next Facebook. Something tons of people will use but has a negative undertone and brand.”

Public opinion soured on Robinhood following the company’s decision to ban retail buy orders in the middle of the Reddit-inspired “short squeeze” on GameStop. Sharp-eyed observers were quick to point out the possible conflict of interest at play given 35% of Robinhood’s revenue came from the same firm which suffered heavy losses at the hands of r/Wallstreetbets organized band of collective traders.

Robinhood has since stated that the only reason it halted retail buy orders was because it couldn’t cover its commitments to the NSCC, which demands that each day’s trading liabilities are covered in full.

The company was contacted for comment, but had not replied by time of publication.","['pr', 'public', 'robinhood', 'shelves', 'reportedly', 'gamestop', 'billion', 'raised', 'plans', 'trading', 'opinion', 'disaster', 'wake', 'tenev', 'ipo', 'successful']","Trading app Robinhood may have put its plans for an initial public offering on hold after public opinion turned against the company in the wake of its response to the short squeeze on GameStop (GME).

XRP’s legal woes may place a damper on the rally

In the past few months, XRP price has been hard hit due to a lawsuit filed against Ripple by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC alleges that the company is conducting an ongoing illegal securities offering as Ripple still periodically sells XRP tokens out of the treasury.

Ripple recently filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the SEC seeking documents pertaining to Ethereum co-founders.

Doge doing what it does best, welcoming people into crypto with a huge slap in the face. https://t.co/0GpiKe4B8U — RyanJK (@RJ_Kunz) January 30, 2021

Just yesterday, Dogecoin made history for cracking the top 10 cryptoassets by marketcap for the first time since 2015. The currency named after a dog meme that was started as a joke was propelled to such lofty heights on the back of similarly record-breaking social media volume, according to analytics provided by The TIE.

While some tied the rapid price appreciation to Elon Musk memes and the inevitable groupthink of crypto’s often momentum-based markets, $DOGE’s success may also be rooted in anti-establishment sentiments running rife through the retail crowd following popular trading app Robinhood disabling ‘Buy’ orders for certain assets.

The move from Robinhood and other brokers prompted furious accusations of hypocrisy and speculation that hedge funds were being favored over smaller investors — and what's a better way to highlight a broken system than pumping a joke coin to a multi-billion dollar valuation?

However, after reports of withdrawal issues on multiple centralized exchanges, Dogecoin has undergone a violent overnight reversal, leading many buyers to take to social media to express their regret. Just a few hours after posting that she’d “finally caved and bought the dog stock,” podcast host and media personality Mia Khalifa indicated some buyer’s remorse:

Once the massive pump lost momentum and traders quickly took profits, it seemed that investors would move on past the meme-based cryptocurrency and find something else to invest in.

The pump initially started when exchanges prevented retail traders from buying more GameStop and AMC stock on Jan. 28. Fueled by the Reddit discussion group r/Wallstreetbets, the army of investors turned their attention to silver and a selection of ‘cheap’ cryptocurrenceis.

On Jan.28, Twitter user ""WSB Chairman"" asked, ""Has Doge ever been to a dollar?"" to his 750,000 followers. That was enough to trigger the monster rally, despite Dogecoin having no protocol upgrades or developments since 2015.

The 68% retracement that followed the peak at $0.087 resembled Bitcoin's (BTC) sharp drop after the December 2017 crash, except this time around, instead of 50 days, it took only 24 hours.

Multiple social media influencers and streamers expressed their discontent at buying the top, an indication that the momentary speculative frenzy had passed. After spending most of Jan. 30 and Jan. 31 hovering around $0.03, DOGE managed to produce another 80% pump in less than three hours.

It's almost impossible to find the exact trigger for those events, as there are multiple social networks, including private Telegram groups and trading signal apps.

Reddit's r/SatoshiStreetBets currently has 213,000 active users and following DOGE’s breakout a meme-post by user Woke_AF_Populist quickly climbed to its most upvoted list.

The most-traded Bitcoin product in centralized exchanges is Bitcoin futures, which is 10 times bigger than spot trading in terms of the trading volume. But on DEXs, spot trading platforms, such as Uniswap, occupy a large portion of the total trading volume, and there is not a single decentralized futures trading platform that could reach even one-10th of Uniswap’s trading volume. What stops decentralized futures trading platforms from becoming 10 times bigger than Uniswap? Why are decentralized futures trading platforms performing worse than their centralized counterparts?

The main reason is that decentralized futures exchanges don’t currently provide an attractive futures product to compete with centralized futures exchanges. For instance, centralized futures exchanges, such as BitMEX, can provide 100 times leverage on Bitcoin futures trading. On the other hand, decentralized futures exchanges, such as dYdX, only offer 10 times leverage. None of the decentralized exchanges can keep up with the 100x leverage offering from centralized exchanges.

YFX Descartes V1 uses QIC-AMM and a system de-risk mechanism to migrate perpetual futures trading from CEXs to DEXs without reducing the trading leverage, which makes YFX the first DEX that could offer 100x leverage on a perpetual contract. You can do everything on YFX you normally do on BitMEX or OKEx. YFX is poised to compete directly against established centralized exchanges. YFX Descartes V1 runs on both Huobi Heco Chain and Tron for faster transaction times and cheaper gas fees compared to Ethereum. The YFX team is also working on Ethereum’s layer-two solution to provide pragmatic perpetual trading on DEXs. The YFX team plans to launch its DEX on the Ethereum testnet in Q1, 2021.

About YFX

YFX is the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts. YFX Descartes V1 launched on both Huobi Heco Chain and Tron, and all trades are held and processed by smart contracts. The main goal of the YFX team, which consists of engineers who have years of experience working on trading systems and blockchain technology, is to build a DEX that can compete with CEXs on derivative trading.

The latest changes to the platform consist of the full rollout of a gift card feature and the integration of MoonPay, which has improved users’ capability of purchasing crypto with fiat-based bank cards.

After a trial run starting late last year, Freewallet has now fully launched a gift card feature aimed at making its users’ lives easier from an e-commerce perspective. With the new feature, users can now buy gift cards for online and brick-and-mortar businesses with any cryptocurrency supported by the platform. The process is simple and can be completed in just a few minutes.

To make the feature possible, Freewallet has partnered with over 800+ brands from around the world, including Amazon, eBay, iTunes and many more. The feature comes with a search tool that allows users to organize their options according to popularity or alphabetical order and includes offerings from a wide variety of stores covering a whole spectrum of consumer needs — including beauty and lifestyle, booksellers, department stores, electronics, entertainment, food and drink, home and DIY, jewelers, leisure and sports, men’s fashion, supermarkets, toys and games, travel and women’s fashion.

These gift cards make the perfect gift option for crypto enthusiasts looking to do something special for their friends and loved ones, and it’s even a great way to treat themselves without having to use fiat. Each gift card can range in value from $1–$1,000, depending on the user’s preference.

The gift card feature is just one of the recent changes to be introduced to the platform. Another significant development has been the integration of MoonPay, one of the industry’s premier fiat-to-crypto transaction facilitators. By bringing in MoonPay, Freewallet has enhanced its purchase-with-card function. Now users can use any of the 42 major fiat currencies supported by MoonPay to purchase Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Chiliz (CHZ), Litecoin (LTC), Stellar (XLM), USD Coin (USDC), EOS, Tron (TRX), NEO, Dai, VeChain (VET), Zilliqa (ZIL), TrueUSD (TUSD), 0x (ZRX), Paxos Standard Token (PAX), Decentraland (MANA), Civic (CVC), EOSDT and USDT20.

These changes are the result of the continuous dialogue between the Freewallet development team and its community. As the platform continues to grow, it has made it a priority to become an all-inclusive crypto hub for its users. Freewallet prides itself on pairing groundbreaking technology with intuitive simplicity.

Solomon Brown, head of PR at Freewallet, had this to say about the changes: “We are really pleased that we can introduce more useful features for our users. We have been quite lucky in that we have been able to gather a large community around our platform and listen to the feedback they provide us with. It is amazing to see both the strides that we have taken as a service and the progress being made in the industry as a whole. We hope that our users will enjoy the new gift card feature as well as the retooled exchange.”

Founded in 2017, the company has built its services around a network of distributed resources that own and profit off unused hardware. Cudos clients can, therefore, harness cloud computing resources securely and at a much lower price as opposed to centralized alternatives. On the other hand, hardware owners are incentivized to share their computing resources in order to provide end-customers with low-latency and cost-effective resources.

The company has since launched the Cudos Network, an exciting endeavor into the blockchain technology market. Aware that high-performance blockchains must access off-chain computing resources, the Cudos Network bridges the gap between cloud computing and blockchain ledgers in a decentralized, secure and incentivizing manner. Over the long term, this will foster innovation across the blockchain space, as project developers will build more performant blockchains that rely on layer-two computations for innovative use cases. The process has already started as Cudos has partnered up with numerous companies in the tech space, including AMD, PlayStation Partners, Verne Global, Outlier Ventures, Sapphire, NexGen Cloud and others.

Cudos token listing on KuCoin

This cloud computing framework is unified under a common standard via Cudos, a utility token that provides access to worthwhile revenue streams within the Cudos Network. After being oversubscribed in the presale and raising over $10 million, the project is now listing Cudos on KuCoin.

Once the listing is live, KuCoin traders will have the opportunity to access a staking mechanism designed to reward users who choose to lock up their tokens for a limited timeframe. It’s imperative to keep in mind that the Cudos Network has its own staking system, which is a prerequisite to becoming an incentivized validator node, earning up to 30% of their stake per annum. Rewards are also available via the delegated staking program, which distributes rewards to users who fail to accumulate the 2-million staking minimum. Cudos ownership is necessary to access cloud compute jobs, representing an all-around access ticket to the Cudos ecosystem.

Cudos value potential grows

Cudos isn’t only listed on KuCoin, however. In fact, the token was first listed as part of a primary listing event on BitMax, only to be later listed on Poloniex as well. Trade analysis shows impressive price gains following the initial listing, thereby highlighting Cudos’ potential as a rewarding utility token. To put this into perspective, the Cudos strategic funding phase debuted at $0.006 per token and managed to attain a $0.12 appreciation as soon as the token was listed on the public market, highlighting a 2,000% rise.

Now trading at an average of $0.07, Cudos is certainly generating considerable hype for cloud computing enthusiasts. As expected, Cudos’ initial investors have been greatly rewarded following the recent price increases, consolidating the idea that people believe in the project’s utility and value proposition for the blockchain market.

Exploring the Cudos tokenomics

The Cudos token is hard-capped at 10 billion coins, with most of the funds raised via the token sales destined to fund the platform’s development, marketing strategy, validator nodes and customer acquisition efforts.

In the foreseeable future, the Cudos token will find itself listed on a growing number of cryptocurrency exchanges, facilitating profit-seeking trades between compatible crypto pairs. At this time, the token is available for purchase and sale via the CUDOS/USDT pair. More trading pairs will be added in the near future.

The CUDOS/USDT trading pair will debut trading at 10:00 on Feb. 2, 2021.

Eleven of the 21 new entrants added to the annual tally are applying blockchain and DLT-based solutions to problems regarding supply chains, product tracking and shipping information.

According to Forbes, “hundreds of sizable companies are now using Bitcoin and its underlying technology to make their operations more efficient.”

“Most companies on the Blockchain 50, however, are not Bitcoin speculators but rather are looking to employ the technology underlying the cryptocurrency in innovative ways.”

Some of the bigger companies in this category include Boeing, which is using a blockchain-enabled air traffic control system for drones; Oracle, which operates a maritime shipping consortium with over 300 customers; and Coca Cola’s CONA Services, which tracks orders, shipments and invoices between bottlers using the blockchain.

French supermarket chain Carrefour is a new entrant and is currently tracking 30 product lines via its own food traceability blockchain. Another is Sappi, which is using the blockchain to increase the sustainability of global supply chains; specifically as they relate to natural materials and packaging.

The emergence of an enterprise-driven, global blockchain logistics market has inspired fierce competition among its vendors, and it is expected to be worth $765.5 million by 2025.

While previous iterations of blockchain tech may not have been quite ready to tackle business problems on a global level, commercially-geared blockchain and DLT platforms — such as Hyperledger, Azure and Corda — provide an exponentially higher amount of network throughput. This has resulted in their increasing employment by a number of large companies seeking blockchain-oriented solutions for logistical problems.

National governments have also started to apply the blockchain to areas of logistics. Last month, the United States military awarded a $1.5 million grant to SIMBA Chain, a smart contract platform to be used in making military supply chains more efficient. Also in January, the U.K. National Health Service took to the blockchain as a means of monitoring stores of COVID-19 vaccine.

Other major companies added to the list this year include Binance, for supporting over 100 blockchains on their exchange, MicroStrategy, for buying more than $1 billion in BTC during 2020, and Kakao, South Korea’s biggest messaging app, for developing its own cryptocurrency called “klay.”","['using', 'underlying', 'dominate', 'global', 'chains', 'logistics', 'tracking', '50', 'supply', 'blockchain', 'added', 'projects', 'additions', 'forbes', 'companies', 'technology', 'chain']","More than half of companies added to the Forbes Blockchain 50 list for the first time this year are using tblockchain to resolve logistical issues faced in their line of business.

A Feb. 3 tweet from MicroStrategy CEO, Michael Saylor, said that representatives of more than 1,400 firms have already signed up for the event — which is dubbed “Bitcoin for Corporations: Legal Considerations.”

There is still time for your legal team to attend. https://t.co/fid9nrZUfP — Michael Saylor (@michael_saylor) February 2, 2021

The seminar will take place on Feb. 3 and Feb. 4, with five one-hour sessions scheduled for the first day, and twice as many 30-minute sessions slated for the second.

The first day will feature presentations from Saylor, the firm’s president and CFO Phong Le, along with representatives of legal firms specializing in digital assets. The topics discussed will include strategies for incorporating Bitcoin into treasury reserves and related questions regarding the accounting, tax, legal, and auditing considerations for firms who pursue this strategy.

The second day will feature presentations from top crypto exchanges and fund managers, including Coinbase, Binance, Grayscale, and Galaxy Digital.

In August, MicroStrategy made headlines after revealing it had purchased 21,000 BTC for $250 million. The following month, Saylor announced the firm had purchased an additional 16,796 Bitcoin for $175 million, with the firm continuously purchasing roughly 0.19 BTC every three seconds over 74 hours to complete the transaction.

In December, MicroStrategy issued $650 million worth of bonds which were quickly mobilized to purchase 29,646 BTC. The firm purchased an additional 314 Bitcoin for $10 million in late January, and a further 295 BTC for $10 million this week, bringing its Bitcoin reserves up to 71,079 BTC, or 0.38% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply.

While MicroStrategy paid $1.095 billion to accumulate its BTC holdings, current prices value the stash at $2.57 billion — a gain of 135%.

In an interview with Forbes, Mayor Francis Suarez said tangible paths to expand Bitcoin's adoption throughout the city included enabling city employee salaries to be paid in BTC.

Major figures in the cryptocurrency world have responded positively to the idea, with Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey calling it “smart” on Twitter.

Germini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss stated that the mayor is “leading the way for governments and Bitcoin.”

Mayor Suarez told Forbes that due to the rise in crypto’s popularity among citizens, he wants to do everything he can to make Miami a Bitcoin-friendly city. Other proposals include allowing local fees and taxes to be paid in Bitcoin and certain other cryptocurrencies, as well as investing some of the city’s treasury into Bitcoin, following Microstrategy’s example.

Although he isn’t sure of specific amounts, Suarez explained that the treasury investment would be structured as a public-private partnership, with the private partners receiving some of the rewards for alleviating some of the risks.

He also revealed that he’s also considering financing his reelection campaign in Bitcoin. He isn’t the first to turn to Bitcoin to help fund political campaigns with Democrat Andrew Yang, California U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell, Minnesota U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer, and Libertarian Lara Loomer among U.S. politicians who have already accepted cryptocurrencies in past campaigns.

The mayor believes Bitcoin will be the “biggest story for the next few years.”

Late last year the mayor called Bitcoin a “stable investment” during an “incredibly unstable year.” Last week, he uploaded Bitcoin’s whitepaper onto the government’s website saying:

“The City of Miami believes in Bitcoin and I’m working day and night to turn Miami into a hub for crypto innovation.”

The mayor told Forbes that he has reached out to other states and jurisdictions, including Caitlin Long in Wyoming and Florida CFO Jimmy Patronis to help drive Bitcoin-friendly changes in Florida’s legislature. These efforts are part of the city’s push to be the next major tech hub in the U.S. with plans to grow innovation and tech growth in the next few years.

Should these actions take effect, Miami’s 450,000 citizens may be encouraged to start transacting in Bitcoin on a regular basis, with the potential for this to spread to the rest of Florida’s 21.5 million residents. It would also make the city more attractive for blockchain-related tech companies and events.

Although Miami may be the first U.S. city to offer employees salaries in Bitcoin, other companies have also been exploring this.

Multiple metrics like the increasing amount of Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) locked in DeFi, soaring transaction and on-chain activity and the plummeting BTC and Ether reserves of top exchanges show that investors are becoming increasingly interested in cryptocurrency.

Data from CryptoQuant, an on-chain analytics firm, shows that as Ether (ETH) established a new all-time high above $1,500 on Feb. 2, the amount of Ether held on all centralized exchange’s reserves continued to drop to new lows as token holders withdrew their coins.

Many analysts believe that the rapidly expanding DeFi sector, launch of Eth2 and increasing participation from institutional investors are the primary reasons for the drop in BTC and Ether held on centralized exchanges.

The rise of DeFi and yield farming

Each week the number of participants interacting with the DeFi sector seems to reach a new high and as of Feb. 2, the total value locked in DeFi platforms has reached $28.67 billion.

Total value locked in DeFi. Source: Defi Pulse

Data from Defi Pulse shows that the majority of DeFi platforms are built on the Ethereum network and require Ether to transact with the protocol.

In addition to offering attractive ways to earn a yield from simply lending Ether, an increasing amount of the available supply is being directed towards DeFi-related activities and not available for trading purposes.

A similar phenomenon is happening with BTC as holders looking to participate in the DeFi space without selling their Bitcoin have been wrapping them into ERC-20 synthetic versions of Ether.

Platforms like REN and BadgerDAO lead in this effort and a similar drain on the available Bitcoin supply could also be helping to push the price of BTC higher.

Eth2 and extended lock-up staking

Since the launch of the Beacon chain on Dec. 1, 2020, the Eth2 contract has enabled token holders to stake their Ether in the new PoS contract by becoming validators for the network.

Data from the Eth2 Launch Pad shows that there are currently 2,907,298 Ether worth a total of $4.39 billion staked on the network earning an estimated APR of 9.2%

The contract has a multi-year commitment but for holders who refuse to stomach the risk and volatility of DeFi yield farming, Eth2 staking offers a way to earn a yield over time rather than let tokens sit on exchanges or in cold wallets.

Institutional investors begin to see the value proposition of Ether

Since 2020, Bitcoin has received the lion’s share of attention from the institutional investment crowd as investors like MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor lead the way by buying up immense sums of Bitcoin and tweeting non-stop about its estimated future value.

Now that Bitcoin is more than a decade old and seen as more established, firms are increasingly open to looking for the next big opportunity that the cryptocurrency sector has to offer. With the explosion of DeFi and its current dependence on the Ethereum network, Ether is quickly becoming a recommended choice for the institutional investors.

Grayscale Investments temporarily closed their various crypto trusts to new investments in late December following the rise in the price of Bitcoin, but inflow resumed in early January and their total Ether holdings have increased by 242% over the past 3 months.

Coinbase also noted in its annual 2020 review that institutional investors are increasingly seeing Ether as a store of value with “a growing number” of its institutional clients taking a position in the token due to the strong returns offered.

The exchange also noted that while a majority of their clients bought BTC throughout 2020, Ether’s strong finish to the year saw it surpass BTC in terms of price growth and this is a trend which has continued into 2021.

As Bitcoin’s institutional adoption increases, United States companies may start to diversify their treasury with other stores of value, and Bitcoin (BTC) stands a good chance to garner a portion of it.

Ark Invest’s latest report, ""Bitcoin: Preparing for Institutions,"" shows that even a paltry allocation of 1% by companies from the S&P 500 could boost Bitcoin’s price by $40,000. However, analysts at Ar believe that the allocation is likely to be in the range of 2.5% to 6.5%, which ""could impact bitcoin’s price by $200,000 to $500,000.""

Even as Bitcoin’s price consolidates and readies for the next leg up, several altcoins have been rising, backed by strong fundamentals and investors' high expectations of their upcoming products. Let’s look at three such tokens today.

BAND/USD

The decentralized finance space has boomed in the past few months, and the success of the protocols rely heavily upon data sources that are decentralized, fast and reliable. This is where Band Protocol steps in. The cross-chain data oracle has announced several partnerships in the past few days, which shows it is gradually building its market share.

The strong rally in stocks such as GameStop, AMC and others have captured traders' attention in the past few days. Band’s tie-up with Injective Protocol to deliver decentralized price oracles for various stocks to be supported on the decentralized derivatives platform could benefit the price of its native token, BAND, as a successful integration would be followed by an increase in demand.

Similarly, Linear Finance, a derivatives asset protocol, will also use Band’s real-time price feeds to offer its clients a seamless trading experience for several synthetic assets.

Band is not limited to only providing price feeds of cryptocurrencies, foreign exchange assets and commodities. Elrond and Band have expanded their partnership further to bridge the two networks to provide off-chain data to various applications being developed on the Elrond network. Other than the usual price feeds, Band will also cater to data requests for sports, gaming, esports and much more.

Along with these, Band has also entered into partnerships with the Moonbeam protocol, Nervos and Fantom in the past few days and broadened its existing partnership with CoinGecko.

BAND price rose from $7.1532 on Jan. 22 to $12.949 on Tuesday, an 81% rally within a short time. Previous to this move, the price had largely been stuck in the range of $7 to $11.50 for the past few days.

BAND/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls pushed the price above the range on Tuesday, but the long wick on the day’s candlestick shows the bears are aggressively selling at higher levels. This has dragged the price back into the aforementioned trading range.

If the bulls do not give up much ground, then one more attempt to break above the range is likely. The 20-day exponential moving average ($9.28) has started to turn up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive territory, which suggests that the path of least resistance is to the upside.

If the bulls can drive and sustain the price above $11.50, the BAND/USD pair could rally to $16 and then to $17.78. This zone may act as stiff resistance, but if the bulls can propel the price above it, the momentum could further pick up.

Contrary to this assumption, if the bears successfully defend the $11.50–$12.949 resistance zone, the pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.

LRC/USD

The GameStop saga and the trading limits imposed on retail traders by brokerages like Robinhood have exposed their significant flaws. This is likely to draw traders to decentralized exchanges where control does not lie with any central entity.

Transaction fees are an extremely important aspect during trading, especially for smaller-sized traders. So, when Ethereum gas fees increase, these retail traders are the most affected. Loopring attempts to solve this problem with it layer-two scaling.

Data from Dune Analytics shows that Loopring’s fee collection recently surged to its highest-ever level due to increasing volume. The protocol recently updated its LRC tokenomics model and announced a new fee distribution pattern to its various participants. This could further attract LRC investors who may want to benefit from the rising popularity of the protocol.

LRC rose from an intraday low at $0.33651 on Jan. 22 to an intraday high at $0.57618 on Jan. 31, a 71% rally within a few days. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls are in control.

LRC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The up-move is currently facing resistance near $0.55, and the LRC/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($0.43). This is an important level to watch out for because the pair has taken support at the 20-day EMA on three previous occasions.

If the pair again rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $0.62167. If they succeed, the pair could rally to $0.71773 and then to $0.78.

This bullish view will invalidate if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that the bulls are not buying the dips anymore, and that could result in a fall to $0.35 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($0.31).

CREAM/USD

Certain aspects of traditional finance could act as an inspiration to build projects in the decentralized space. Cream Finance recently announced the launch of Iron Bank, which is guided by the success of the $10-trillion U.S. corporate debt market.

While there are several peer-to-peer lending protocols existing in the crypto space, Cream has taken it a step further and created a protocol-to-protocol lending mechanism. The main attraction of the Iron Bank is that it will facilitate zero-collateral lending.

To keep the risk under check, Cream will set a credit limit after whitelisting the protocols. Initially, the Iron Bank is available only for Cream’s partners, but if this project succeeds, it is likely to be a huge positive for the entire DeFi space.

In other news, Cream recently widened its services by adding SushiSwap and Uniswap LP tokens as collateral options for lending and borrowing.

The platform's CREAM token rallied from $119.35 on Jan. 22 to an intraday high at $319.9 on Tuesday, a 168% rally within a short time. The long wick on the day’s candlestick shows that traders aggressively booked profits at higher levels.

CREAM/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the bulls do not allow the price to dip below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $251.65, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. The upsloping 20-day EMA ($181) and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest the advantage to the bulls.

If the bulls can push and sustain the price above $294.80, the CREAM/USD pair could rally to $362 and then to $430.

Conversely, if the bears sink the price below $251.65, the pair could dip to the 61.8% retracement level at $209.45.

According to a report by the American political publication Politico, Tenev is expected to participate in a virtual hearing headed by Representative Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) on Feb. 18. Politico’s report cited anonymous people familiar with the matter.

Waters officially announced the Financial Services Committee’s plans to hold a GameStop-related hearing on Feb. 18. Entitled “Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide,” the hearing will focus on recent market volatility issues involving GameStop and other stocks.

“I am concerned about whether or not Robinhood restricted the trading because there was collusion between Robinhood and some of the hedge funds that were involved with this,” Waters reportedly said.

The announcement did not specify what witnesses will participate in the hearing. Robinhood has not officially announced Tenev’s participation so far. The firm did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.

As previously reported, some U.S. regulators have already drawn attention to Robinhood’s handling the GameStop short squeeze. On Jan. 29, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission hinted that it was looking at Robinhood’s issues with GameStop, expressing concern over “extreme price volatility of certain stocks’ trading prices.”

Robinhood’s GameStop saga started on Jan. 28 when the company suspended buying for GameStop stock and other shares that were allegedly pumped through the r/Wallstreetbets Reddit community. Robinhood subsequently restricted trading for as many as 50 stocks on Friday before narrowing the restrictions to eight stocks on Feb. 8. Still, Robinhood users are limited to just one GameStop share.

On Feb. 1, Robinhood’s Tenev discussed the firm’s move to restrict trading with Elon Musk on the audio chat app Clubhouse. Tenev reportedly said that the decision about restrictions was made by a clearinghouse and was based on the capital requirements. He also denied allegations that trading firm Citadel Securities — the largest market maker in options in the U.S. — had pushed the firm to impose the limits.","['ceo', 'hearing', 'stocks', 'robinhood', 'house', 'testify', 'reportedly', 'gamestop', 'committee', 'trading', 'feb', 'robinhoods', 'firm', 'tenev']","Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev will reportedly testify before the United States House Financial Services Committee over the firm’s role in the volatile trading of GameStop and other volatile stocks.

According to its website, Robinhood has lowered its list of restrictions to eight different stocks including GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, Express, Genius Brands International, Koss, Naked Brand Group and Nokia. Robinhood previously limited trading for as many as 50 stocks on Friday, CNBC reported.

As per the new restrictions, Robinhood users can still only buy one share of GameStop alongside five options contracts. AMC trading is capped at 10 shares and 10 options contracts.

Robinhood users who already hold a greater number of shares or contracts will have to sell their holdings in order to open more positions, the firm said:

“If you already hold a greater number of shares or contracts than the limits listed above, your positions will not be sold or closed. However, you will not be able to open more positions of each of these securities unless you sell enough of your holdings such that you are below the respective limit.”

Robinhood has been struggling to maintain its trading services while the r/Wallstreetbets Reddit community pumps stocks like GME to new all-time highs. On Thursday, Robinhood suspended GME purchases after the stock skyrocketed 1,400% from about $20 on Jan. 12. On Friday, the firm also temporarily disabled instant deposits for cryptocurrency purchases, citing “extraordinary market conditions.”

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission subsequently hinted that it was looking into the Robinhood platform, citing concerns over “extreme price volatility of certain stocks’ trading prices.”

Robinhood’s decision to halt GME trading was widely criticized in the trading community, with at least 100,000 negative reviews appearing on Robinhood’s page on the Google Play Store. Despite Google’s subsequent move to scrap thousands of negative reviews with its “fake review” tracking system, Robinhood app’s rating is still down to one star, with 294,954 reviews posted at publishing time.

Amid the ongoing issues, Robinhood users launched the “#robinhoodboycott” tag on Twitter, calling on traders to move their holdings off the platform. However, Robinhood is not the only company experiencing issues due to the GameStop short squeeze. On Saturday, online trading platform IG Group Holdings said that it will restrict any new positions on GME and AMC due to “extreme volatility” in the market.","['platform', 'share', 'stocks', 'positions', 'holdings', 'robinhood', 'gamestop', 'trading', 'gme', 'shares', 'users', 'limited']","Troubled trading app Robinhood has been narrowing the list of restricted stocks on its platform but is still keeping major restrictions on GameStop shares.

In his letter to employees, Bezos said that he would be transitioning to the role of executive chair of the Amazon board, where he would “focus my energies and attention on new products and early initiatives.” The transition is scheduled for later in the year.

Bezos also noted that Jassy “will be an outstanding leader, and has my full confidence.”

The crypto world’s attention now turns to Jassy’s history when it comes to embracing blockchain technology, as it could be an indication of the long-term crypto strategy of the world’s third-most valuable company by market capitalization.

Jassy offered a mixed review of blockchain technology and its applicability to Amazon's business in 2017. In a statement at the Amazon ""re:Invent"" conference, he expressed doubt that blockchain could be used for more than a “distributed ledger” but also said he and his team were personally interested. However, company policy dictated that they don't “build technology [just] because we think it is cool.”

He did leave the door open for future exploration, however, saying, “We are very intrigued by what customers are ultimately going to do there.”

In 2018, Jassy did move forward with a “quasi-blockchain” offering, as he oversaw the launch of two blockchain products: Amazon Quantum Ledger Database and Amazon Managed Blockchain. As Cointelegraph reported, the products maintained centralized databases but included cryptographic qualities.

Aside from these forays, Amazon has largely only made crypto headlines as a scapegoat: In November 2020, Coinbase blamed an AWS outage for one of its frequent service interruptions.

“Buy crypto” searches on Google surged to all-time highs in January, far exceeding the previous peak of early 2018, according to cryptocurrency analytics company The Tie.

Relative search interest for the term ""Buy Crypto"" is at all-time high on Google Trends pic.twitter.com/4cFIkI0xbp — The TIE (@TheTIEIO) February 1, 2021

The keyword received a perfect Google Trends score of 100, which indicates maximum relative interest.

A similar spike was also observed for Ethereum, which achieved a perfect score of 100 before falling back down to a still-strong 65.

Bitcoin (BTC) searches also spiked, but remain well below the 2017 bull market high.

The Tie also shared the following chart with Cointelegraph, which highlights a sharp rise in searches for “best crypto app” and “best crypto exchange.”

“Relative search interest for popular crypto terms is at an all-time high on Google Trends,” Treyce Dahlem, research analyst at The Tie, to Cointelegraph.

He continued:

“Whether this is due to the recent price rallies that we’ve seen, speculative traders from Reddit looking to leave their mark on more assets, or even a macro shift in the way investors are searching for a hedge against inflation, one thing is clear: There is a rapidly growing interest in crypto and new investors are looking for the best way to get into the ecosystem.”

The explosive search trends seem to coincide with growing retail interest in both Ethereum and altcoins. Ether’s (ETH) price has doubled since the start of the year, having just reached a new all-time high above $1,500.

Meanwhile, the overall cryptocurrency market in January reached $1 trillion for the first time. While the initial spike was largely due to Bitcoin, altcoins have supported the trillion-dollar valuation with greater intensity over the past month. In the process, Bitcoin’s dominance rate has fallen to 62% from a high of 72% in early January.

Google search trends are sometimes correlated with movements in the overall cryptocurrency market. Higher relative searches signal growing retail awareness of digital assets, which is often a precursor to wider speculative adoption.

The Tie revealed to Cointelegraph that social media engagement surrounding crypto has also skyrocketed. On Twitter, aggregate tweet volumes devoted to cryptocurrency reached 3.3 million in January, up from 1.3 million in September 2020. January’s aggregate tweet volume was 181% higher than a year earlier.","['record', 'interest', 'search', 'trends', 'alltime', 'searches', 'crypto', 'buy', 'cryptocurrency', 'high', 'hit', 'google', 'tie']","If Google search trends are anything to go by, crypto euphoria appears to be on the rise again, according to new industry research.

According to an announcement from Cash App, its clearing broker, Axos, halted the app’s ability to complete purchases of stocks for GameStop, AMC Entertainment, Nokia and Koss Corporation — at least four of the stocks pushed by retail investors on the r/Wallstreetbets subreddit in their fight against hedge funds’ shorts. However, the app later tweeted that the broker has restored trading for AMC and Nokia.

Cash App initially said that it “wholeheartedly” disagreed with Axos’ actions and added that it would attempt to allow users to purchase all the affected stocks “as soon as possible.” The platform has not mentioned any change in the status of trading GameStop and Koss Corporation stocks, but the price of GME fell under $100 for the first time in a week, reaching $99.50 at the time of publication.

Though it appeared that Cash App was trying to distance itself from any possible allegations of market manipulation in the wake of the GameStop short sells, the restrictions on buys were similar to those imposed by other trading apps last week.

Robinhood announced on Thursday that it had suspended buying for GameStop stock and others after many of the stocks surged. The trading app has since lowered these restrictions, but its users are still limited to buying one GME share as of yesterday.

The excitement surrounding this project has electrified several major Chinese cities, as well as onlookers throughout the world.

Most recently, Shenzhen launched its “iShenzhen” lottery, wherein the city government will distribute 20 million digital yuan among 100,000 central bank digital currency, or CBDC, wallet holders. This comes on the back of a similar lottery held in the city of Suzhou, one of China’s major “special economic zones.” Suzhou has already engaged with several blockchain projects in an effort to deepen the municipality’s understanding and use of decentralized technology, smart contracts and the general learning curve the local population may face.

Related: China turns up pace on CBDC release, tests infrastructure prior to adoption

As China continues to cement itself in the international economy, it is proving to be a leader in the race toward CBDC adoption, an initiative that would make Chinese goods and services more accessible within the global marketplace. Many experts in the fields of fiscal policy and financial technology have argued that the digitization of public money is an inevitable consequence of distributed ledger technology.

The particular political and economic ramifications of this switch to digital currency will depend on the specific decisions of governments regarding their approaches to these new technologies. China, for example, has adopted an approach that has seen repeated success throughout contemporary business culture.

A number of other nations, with economies of all sizes, are more or less waiting in the wings as the People’s Bank of China demonstrates its leadership. In the Suzhou and Shenzhen experiments, citizens are allotted digital yuan and encouraged to link their digital wallets to their existing PBoC accounts, and if they do not use the digital currency within a few weeks, it disappears.

Nations are especially eager to see how this program unfolds and how adoption looks at the grassroots level. Businesses and governments have a natural incentive to embrace this technology, as it reduces overhead and friction, which enhances their bottom line. However, for citizens whose motives might not be tied to financial gain, which other incentives will prompt them to start using an entirely different system of money and banking? These aforementioned adoption trends will be a key driver that determines how quickly other nations will begin developing their own CBDCs.

Related: Did CBDCs affect the crypto space in 2020, and what’s next in 2021? Experts answer

Smaller nations have a better chance for quicker launches

This experiment has excited economic participation within China and roused interest from public banks across the world. Which countries have positioned themselves to follow China into the digital future? Certainly, China’s influence, as well as a long-standing pro-technology culture throughout the continent, suggests that many East Asian countries may follow suit. The Bank of Thailand launched a CBDC pilot program back in June 2020. Moreover, just last fall, the Bank of Korea announced plans for a 2021 CBDC issuance, while Japanese banking officials have articulated a more cautious, passive course of interest following China’s CBDC.

Smaller nations, of course, have a different set of obstacles in their financial experimentation. Recently, the Bahamas introduced its “Sand Dollar” and Cambodia its “Bakong,” following China’s example. This is made possible, however, by the smaller size of these national banking systems that allow them to move with greater agility as well as a degree of autonomy. This becomes an advantage for smaller nations, as the global dependence on their currency is also smaller, so the interoperability issues are of a lesser priority than for global economies like the United States and China where it becomes a highly critical aspect.

However, larger nations are also showing greater interest. A year-long research report published recently by the central banks of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates shows that the early adoption of digital currencies is favorable — particularly for major economies that have operated with relatively higher degrees of autonomy, unlike those in the eurozone or a part of the North American Free Trade Association, for example. Like China, the Saudi and Emirati governments, given their manufacturing and natural resources, do not accrue as much debt as is standard in other major economies in the West.

This brings to light an interesting aspect of CBDC adoption, one that may influence the process of digitization across the world’s public banks. While a huge number of factors determine how and when a particular economy may adopt digital currency — such as its size, the preexisting economic landscape, its gross domestic product, etc. — an important aspect seems to be a strong national (as opposed to global) economic program. This is interesting not only because it flags particular nations as being predisposed to CBDCs but also because it highlights the importance of interoperability after a currency has been instituted. These digitization programs, in other words, will be brought about through strong national economic policy control, but in order to uphold the global systems that we live in, these technologies will need to interact through intermediary programs.

Interoperability is highly critical for major economies

With a push to all the global CBDC initiatives, the Bank of International Settlements’ Innovation Hub, or BISIH, announced that CBDC research is a top priority for it in 2021. It plans to gauge the feasibility of faster, cheaper cross-border payments. This initiative is going to be highly beneficial for global economies exploring the interoperability of their own CBDC projects using BISIH research and pilot tests to facilitate their own CBDC program and by working with them for all settlements and cross-border payment concerns.

While focusing on domestic use cases is understandable for individual countries, CBDCs will only ever operate in local sandboxes unless there is some type of interoperable protocol. It is critical to bridge the gaps between the various CBDC initiatives and existing payments systems as well as other digital currencies to ensure their success on a global scale.

While governments exploring the use of CBDCs is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, truly borderless, global commerce will be powered with the help of an interoperable protocol, as our economic system is too multifaceted to be replaced by a singular currency.

The particular political and economic ramifications of this switch to digital currency will depend on the specific decisions of governments regarding their approaches to these new technologies.
While a huge number of factors determine how and when a particular economy may adopt digital currency — such as its size, the preexisting economic landscape, its gross domestic product, etc.
— an important aspect seems to be a strong national (as opposed to global) economic program.

The move marks a major step for the fledgling DeFi sector and more fixed-rate lending protocols in DeFi may attract additional users seeking mostability in longer-term investments and loans, such as mortgages. Currently, the ecosystem is largely populated by yield farmers looking for quick gains on their crypto collateral.

The DeFi engineer attempted the process through TradFi by seeking an offset loan, which directs a savings account’s interest towards paying down a mortgage.

Speaking to The Defiant, however, the borrower stated that banks are very cautious about lending in times of economic uncertainty, especially to those that are self-employed. He added that he had been rejected for a basic credit card for four years.

Notional Finance provides fixed-rate loans for up to six months for users that deposit crypto collateral in wrapped BTC, ETH, wrapped ETH, or DAI.

The approach was far from simple and user-friendly for noobs, however. The engineer had to pay off his bank loan first in AUD. He then had to borrow the USD pegged stablecoin USDC from Notional at a fixed rate, providing his own liquidity to avoid the slippage and fees on the new low volume platform.

He then added around $1 million in wBTC and wETH as collateral to Notional against which he borrowed around $500,000 of USDC which was converted to AUD to pay off the bank. He said:

“I feel like I’m in full control of my situation. People should be all over this stuff.”

Borrowing rates on Notional Finance for USDC are approximately 6% but some of that can be recouped by earnings from liquidity provision. There is the added bonus of maintaining a position in a bull market without having to sell crypto assets and incur a capital gains event upon which there would have been taxes to pay.

He added that the process was fast compared to traditional finance;

“It felt like it would’ve taken months of applications, finding tax returns and bank statements for the bank to refinance me, but I was able to do it all in one day, under my own agency,”

Leading DeFi protocol Aave has also started down the mortgage path with its latest partnership. In an announcement on Feb. 2, Aave stated that the scheme was in collaboration with RealT, a firm that tokenizes real estate in order to allow users to stake their property as collateral to take out loans. The ability to use these assets as collateral is the first step in making “mortgage” loans on Ethereum available to a wider audience.","['refinances', 'mortgage', 'notional', 'bank', 'defi', 'single', 'aussie', 'engineer', 'added', 'loan', 'using', 'collateral', 'pioneering', 'usdc', 'users', 'day', 'loans']","The move marks a major step for the fledgling DeFi sector and more fixed-rate lending protocols in DeFi may attract additional users seeking mostability in longer-term investments and loans, such as mortgages.

“What’s great about Terra is they are one of the first sandbox experiments that’s getting outside the sandbox […] We are always looking at those projects because they are the canaries in the coal mines of what else is going to happen.”

Terra is also home to fast-rising DeFi projects like Mirror Protocol, which allows for the trading of stocks, indexes and commodities. The value of liquidity locked in the protocol has almost doubled in the space of two weeks to reach an all-time high of $171.3 million on Feb. 1.

Nic Carter, a former Fidelity crypto asset analyst and Castle Island Ventures partner, slammed the Wall Street Journal article titled “Behind the Bitcoin Bubble” by Andy Kessler, alleging that it verged on “journalistic malpractice”.

“Normally, if you are a columnist writing in one of the most respected financial publications, you might try and evaluate the data behind that claim, instead of just uncritically accepting it. But Mr. Kessler did no such thing. He just blindly repeated a fanciful claim from an anonymous blogger in order to imply that Bitcoin’s price was somehow dependent on Tether.”

The award-winning WSJ writer based some of his fairly extensive criticism on the work of a blogger called “CryptoAnon” in a viral post called “The Bit Short: Inside Crypto’s Doomsday Machine”. Kessler wrote the blogger had ""found that as much as two-thirds of Bitcoin buys on any given day were purchased with Tether"" based on CoinLib data.

Raising questions over Tether and its lack of audits and the idea USDT was being employed to buy Bitcoin to ""jack up its price,"" Kessler added;

“Normally I wouldn’t care. Bitcoin is nothing, it’s vapor, a concept of an idea. Transactions using Bitcoin are few and far between. It’s not a store of value—anything that drops 30% in a week can’t play that role.”

Kessler said he must also note that ""wallet provider Coinbase, the largest holder of Bitcoin, says it 'does not support USDT.' Do they know something? (Coinbase offers its own stablecoin USDC, in partnership with Circle.)

Carter, who is now board chair at Coin Metrics, wrote that assessing trade between USDT and Bitcoin using data called CoinLib was “indefensible” as it included tens of billions of wash trading data from exchanges that reputable data sources ignore.

He said any serious trader knows that “many of the exchanges composing the CoinLib sample are not credible, and that the resultant data was thus completely unreliable.”

“As I will demonstrate, this data is not sufficient to make the case that Bitcoin liquidity is dominated by Tether, and relying on it is liable to mislead. Unfortunately, the mainstream financial press is now amplifying these erroneous claims.”

Carter stated that CoinLib is taking the data outputs from marginal and often non-fiat connected Tether based exchanges as face value, and “unsophisticated analysts like CryptoAnon” are using it to disseminate FUD about Bitcoin’s liquidity.

He argued that highly regulated exchanges and institutional fund providers do not rely on or even support Tether in some cases and they all facilitate an on-ramp to Bitcoin and support the price.

“Other entities like Cash App, Paxos, Paypal, BlockFi, Robinhood, Bitwise, and Grayscale all facilitate various forms of exposure to Bitcoin and are connected to the commercial bank system and in some cases publicly-traded companies. No Tether present.”

Carter concludes that Kessler needs more research and called for a retraction and a correction by the WSJ:

“Wild theories relying on data that everyone in the crypto industry knows to be erroneous do no one any good.”","['coinlib', 'kessler', 'metrics', 'bitcoin', 'coin', 'tether', 'called', 'usdt', 'data', 'using', 'aim', 'exchanges', 'wsjs', 'cofounder', 'takes', 'support', 'fud']","The co-founder of crypto data and insights firm Coin Metrics has fired back at yet another article in mainstream media claiming that the “Bitcoin bubble” has been driven by Tether.

According to Fox Business Network’s Charles Gasparino, sources inside Robinhood say the company’s only focus is surviving the fallout from the drama it currently finds itself engulfed in, and will pause its plans for an IPO launch for now.

Execs say they have access to even more capital than additional amounts raised today. More @TeamCavuto 1230pm — Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) February 1, 2021

As reported by Techcrunch, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev was quizzed by none other than Elon Musk on invite-only app Clubhouse, where Tenev revealed the extent of the firm’s losses.

According to Tenev, he woke up early on Jan. 28 to find a bill from the National Securities Clearing Corporation for the sum of $3 billion, payable immediately. Providing context for that number, Tenev said:

“Robinhood up until that point has raised around $2 billion in total venture capital. Up until now, so it’s a big number, like $3 billion is a large number, right.”

The Wall Street Journal reported on Feb. 1 that Robinhood had raised another $2.4 billion from investors, taking the total sum of money raised since last Thursday to $3.4 billion. Yet despite apparently having no problems with liquidity, the firm appears to have reasoned that its current public perception would not be conducive to a successful IPO.

Indeed, a vast majority of surveyed professionals believe that Robinhood has ruined its chances of launching an IPO due to its behavior during the recent GameStop saga.

An anonymous survey conducted via the Blind networking forum asked 8,750 verified professionals from major tech and financial services companies if they thought Robinhood had “screwed its IPO”. The results revealed that 83% thought the firm’s chances of a successful initial public offering had been irreparably damaged.

The response given by 37 Robinhood employees surveyed was markedly different. Just 13.5% believe the company has killed the possibility of ever seeing a successful IPO launch, while 86.5% believe it can still go ahead.

A self-effacing comment from a Facebook employee expressed the view that the IPO could still go ahead, but that Robinhood would forever suffer the same negative public opinion as the ubiquitous social media giant. They wrote:

“Robinhood is the next Facebook. Something tons of people will use but has a negative undertone and brand.”

Public opinion soured on Robinhood following the company’s decision to ban retail buy orders in the middle of the Reddit-inspired “short squeeze” on GameStop. Sharp-eyed observers were quick to point out the possible conflict of interest at play given 35% of Robinhood’s revenue came from the same firm which suffered heavy losses at the hands of r/Wallstreetbets organized band of collective traders.

Robinhood has since stated that the only reason it halted retail buy orders was because it couldn’t cover its commitments to the NSCC, which demands that each day’s trading liabilities are covered in full.

The company was contacted for comment, but had not replied by time of publication.","['pr', 'raised', 'ipo', 'disaster', 'public', 'successful', 'gamestop', 'reportedly', 'wake', 'billion', 'tenev', 'opinion', 'shelves', 'trading', 'robinhood', 'plans']","Trading app Robinhood may have put its plans for an initial public offering on hold after public opinion turned against the company in the wake of its response to the short squeeze on GameStop (GME).

Doge doing what it does best, welcoming people into crypto with a huge slap in the face. https://t.co/0GpiKe4B8U — RyanJK (@RJ_Kunz) January 30, 2021

Just yesterday, Dogecoin made history for cracking the top 10 cryptoassets by marketcap for the first time since 2015. The currency named after a dog meme that was started as a joke was propelled to such lofty heights on the back of similarly record-breaking social media volume, according to analytics provided by The TIE.

While some tied the rapid price appreciation to Elon Musk memes and the inevitable groupthink of crypto’s often momentum-based markets, $DOGE’s success may also be rooted in anti-establishment sentiments running rife through the retail crowd following popular trading app Robinhood disabling ‘Buy’ orders for certain assets.

The move from Robinhood and other brokers prompted furious accusations of hypocrisy and speculation that hedge funds were being favored over smaller investors — and what's a better way to highlight a broken system than pumping a joke coin to a multi-billion dollar valuation?

However, after reports of withdrawal issues on multiple centralized exchanges, Dogecoin has undergone a violent overnight reversal, leading many buyers to take to social media to express their regret. Just a few hours after posting that she’d “finally caved and bought the dog stock,” podcast host and media personality Mia Khalifa indicated some buyer’s remorse:

The coin’s CMC page offers up a brief timeline of the GameStop saga, describing the short-squeeze tactic and the subsequent effect it had on the Robinhood trading app, which suspended retail trading for GameStop and several other stocks, including AMC, Nokia and Blackberry.

Once the massive pump lost momentum and traders quickly took profits, it seemed that investors would move on past the meme-based cryptocurrency and find something else to invest in.

The pump initially started when exchanges prevented retail traders from buying more GameStop and AMC stock on Jan. 28. Fueled by the Reddit discussion group r/Wallstreetbets, the army of investors turned their attention to silver and a selection of ‘cheap’ cryptocurrenceis.

On Jan.28, Twitter user ""WSB Chairman"" asked, ""Has Doge ever been to a dollar?"" to his 750,000 followers. That was enough to trigger the monster rally, despite Dogecoin having no protocol upgrades or developments since 2015.

The 68% retracement that followed the peak at $0.087 resembled Bitcoin's (BTC) sharp drop after the December 2017 crash, except this time around, instead of 50 days, it took only 24 hours.

Multiple social media influencers and streamers expressed their discontent at buying the top, an indication that the momentary speculative frenzy had passed. After spending most of Jan. 30 and Jan. 31 hovering around $0.03, DOGE managed to produce another 80% pump in less than three hours.

It's almost impossible to find the exact trigger for those events, as there are multiple social networks, including private Telegram groups and trading signal apps.

Reddit's r/SatoshiStreetBets currently has 213,000 active users and following DOGE’s breakout a meme-post by user Woke_AF_Populist quickly climbed to its most upvoted list.

There seems to be endless support from the Dogecoin fanbase, including Tesla's CEO and founder Elon Musk. The lack of a concrete use case for the meme-coin certainly raises the question of whether members of r/WallStreetBets will jump ship from traditional markets and embrace the generally unregulated ethos of the cryptocurrency sector.

DOGE to $1?

Data from Cointelegraph Markets, CoinMarketCap and Tradingview showed a transformation taking place in the DOGE ecosystem overnight on Jan. 27, with DOGE/USD hitting $0.0138.

In a matter of hours on Thursday, the pair added over 80% to its spot price before correcting, still holding 1 cent support at the time of writing.

The gains accompanied a similar surge in interest on social media, with Twitter activity up by more than 300%. The source, it appears, is the same Reddit group that sparked a dramatic but highly controversial bull run in the stock price of U.S. consumer electronics firm GameStop.

Dogecoin already has something in common with $GME, both assets having seen publicity tweets from Tesla CEO and world's richest man, Elon Musk in recent weeks. As Cointelegraph reported, Musk's tongue-in-cheek endorsement of DOGE was enough to induce serious price action.

The most-traded Bitcoin product in centralized exchanges is Bitcoin futures, which is 10 times bigger than spot trading in terms of the trading volume. But on DEXs, spot trading platforms, such as Uniswap, occupy a large portion of the total trading volume, and there is not a single decentralized futures trading platform that could reach even one-10th of Uniswap’s trading volume. What stops decentralized futures trading platforms from becoming 10 times bigger than Uniswap? Why are decentralized futures trading platforms performing worse than their centralized counterparts?

The main reason is that decentralized futures exchanges don’t currently provide an attractive futures product to compete with centralized futures exchanges. For instance, centralized futures exchanges, such as BitMEX, can provide 100 times leverage on Bitcoin futures trading. On the other hand, decentralized futures exchanges, such as dYdX, only offer 10 times leverage. None of the decentralized exchanges can keep up with the 100x leverage offering from centralized exchanges.

YFX Descartes V1 uses QIC-AMM and a system de-risk mechanism to migrate perpetual futures trading from CEXs to DEXs without reducing the trading leverage, which makes YFX the first DEX that could offer 100x leverage on a perpetual contract. You can do everything on YFX you normally do on BitMEX or OKEx. YFX is poised to compete directly against established centralized exchanges. YFX Descartes V1 runs on both Huobi Heco Chain and Tron for faster transaction times and cheaper gas fees compared to Ethereum. The YFX team is also working on Ethereum’s layer-two solution to provide pragmatic perpetual trading on DEXs. The YFX team plans to launch its DEX on the Ethereum testnet in Q1, 2021.

About YFX

YFX is the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts. YFX Descartes V1 launched on both Huobi Heco Chain and Tron, and all trades are held and processed by smart contracts. The main goal of the YFX team, which consists of engineers who have years of experience working on trading systems and blockchain technology, is to build a DEX that can compete with CEXs on derivative trading.

The latest changes to the platform consist of the full rollout of a gift card feature and the integration of MoonPay, which has improved users’ capability of purchasing crypto with fiat-based bank cards.

After a trial run starting late last year, Freewallet has now fully launched a gift card feature aimed at making its users’ lives easier from an e-commerce perspective. With the new feature, users can now buy gift cards for online and brick-and-mortar businesses with any cryptocurrency supported by the platform. The process is simple and can be completed in just a few minutes.

To make the feature possible, Freewallet has partnered with over 800+ brands from around the world, including Amazon, eBay, iTunes and many more. The feature comes with a search tool that allows users to organize their options according to popularity or alphabetical order and includes offerings from a wide variety of stores covering a whole spectrum of consumer needs — including beauty and lifestyle, booksellers, department stores, electronics, entertainment, food and drink, home and DIY, jewelers, leisure and sports, men’s fashion, supermarkets, toys and games, travel and women’s fashion.

These gift cards make the perfect gift option for crypto enthusiasts looking to do something special for their friends and loved ones, and it’s even a great way to treat themselves without having to use fiat. Each gift card can range in value from $1–$1,000, depending on the user’s preference.

The gift card feature is just one of the recent changes to be introduced to the platform. Another significant development has been the integration of MoonPay, one of the industry’s premier fiat-to-crypto transaction facilitators. By bringing in MoonPay, Freewallet has enhanced its purchase-with-card function. Now users can use any of the 42 major fiat currencies supported by MoonPay to purchase Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Chiliz (CHZ), Litecoin (LTC), Stellar (XLM), USD Coin (USDC), EOS, Tron (TRX), NEO, Dai, VeChain (VET), Zilliqa (ZIL), TrueUSD (TUSD), 0x (ZRX), Paxos Standard Token (PAX), Decentraland (MANA), Civic (CVC), EOSDT and USDT20.

These changes are the result of the continuous dialogue between the Freewallet development team and its community. As the platform continues to grow, it has made it a priority to become an all-inclusive crypto hub for its users. Freewallet prides itself on pairing groundbreaking technology with intuitive simplicity.

Solomon Brown, head of PR at Freewallet, had this to say about the changes: “We are really pleased that we can introduce more useful features for our users. We have been quite lucky in that we have been able to gather a large community around our platform and listen to the feedback they provide us with. It is amazing to see both the strides that we have taken as a service and the progress being made in the industry as a whole. We hope that our users will enjoy the new gift card feature as well as the retooled exchange.”

Founded in 2017, the company has built its services around a network of distributed resources that own and profit off unused hardware. Cudos clients can, therefore, harness cloud computing resources securely and at a much lower price as opposed to centralized alternatives. On the other hand, hardware owners are incentivized to share their computing resources in order to provide end-customers with low-latency and cost-effective resources.

The company has since launched the Cudos Network, an exciting endeavor into the blockchain technology market. Aware that high-performance blockchains must access off-chain computing resources, the Cudos Network bridges the gap between cloud computing and blockchain ledgers in a decentralized, secure and incentivizing manner. Over the long term, this will foster innovation across the blockchain space, as project developers will build more performant blockchains that rely on layer-two computations for innovative use cases. The process has already started as Cudos has partnered up with numerous companies in the tech space, including AMD, PlayStation Partners, Verne Global, Outlier Ventures, Sapphire, NexGen Cloud and others.

Cudos token listing on KuCoin

This cloud computing framework is unified under a common standard via Cudos, a utility token that provides access to worthwhile revenue streams within the Cudos Network. After being oversubscribed in the presale and raising over $10 million, the project is now listing Cudos on KuCoin.

Once the listing is live, KuCoin traders will have the opportunity to access a staking mechanism designed to reward users who choose to lock up their tokens for a limited timeframe. It’s imperative to keep in mind that the Cudos Network has its own staking system, which is a prerequisite to becoming an incentivized validator node, earning up to 30% of their stake per annum. Rewards are also available via the delegated staking program, which distributes rewards to users who fail to accumulate the 2-million staking minimum. Cudos ownership is necessary to access cloud compute jobs, representing an all-around access ticket to the Cudos ecosystem.

Cudos value potential grows

Cudos isn’t only listed on KuCoin, however. In fact, the token was first listed as part of a primary listing event on BitMax, only to be later listed on Poloniex as well. Trade analysis shows impressive price gains following the initial listing, thereby highlighting Cudos’ potential as a rewarding utility token. To put this into perspective, the Cudos strategic funding phase debuted at $0.006 per token and managed to attain a $0.12 appreciation as soon as the token was listed on the public market, highlighting a 2,000% rise.

Now trading at an average of $0.07, Cudos is certainly generating considerable hype for cloud computing enthusiasts. As expected, Cudos’ initial investors have been greatly rewarded following the recent price increases, consolidating the idea that people believe in the project’s utility and value proposition for the blockchain market.

Exploring the Cudos tokenomics

The Cudos token is hard-capped at 10 billion coins, with most of the funds raised via the token sales destined to fund the platform’s development, marketing strategy, validator nodes and customer acquisition efforts.

In the foreseeable future, the Cudos token will find itself listed on a growing number of cryptocurrency exchanges, facilitating profit-seeking trades between compatible crypto pairs. At this time, the token is available for purchase and sale via the CUDOS/USDT pair. More trading pairs will be added in the near future.

The CUDOS/USDT trading pair will debut trading at 10:00 on Feb. 2, 2021.

Eleven of the 21 new entrants added to the annual tally are applying blockchain and DLT-based solutions to problems regarding supply chains, product tracking and shipping information.

According to Forbes, “hundreds of sizable companies are now using Bitcoin and its underlying technology to make their operations more efficient.”

“Most companies on the Blockchain 50, however, are not Bitcoin speculators but rather are looking to employ the technology underlying the cryptocurrency in innovative ways.”

Some of the bigger companies in this category include Boeing, which is using a blockchain-enabled air traffic control system for drones; Oracle, which operates a maritime shipping consortium with over 300 customers; and Coca Cola’s CONA Services, which tracks orders, shipments and invoices between bottlers using the blockchain.

French supermarket chain Carrefour is a new entrant and is currently tracking 30 product lines via its own food traceability blockchain. Another is Sappi, which is using the blockchain to increase the sustainability of global supply chains; specifically as they relate to natural materials and packaging.

The emergence of an enterprise-driven, global blockchain logistics market has inspired fierce competition among its vendors, and it is expected to be worth $765.5 million by 2025.

While previous iterations of blockchain tech may not have been quite ready to tackle business problems on a global level, commercially-geared blockchain and DLT platforms — such as Hyperledger, Azure and Corda — provide an exponentially higher amount of network throughput. This has resulted in their increasing employment by a number of large companies seeking blockchain-oriented solutions for logistical problems.

National governments have also started to apply the blockchain to areas of logistics. Last month, the United States military awarded a $1.5 million grant to SIMBA Chain, a smart contract platform to be used in making military supply chains more efficient. Also in January, the U.K. National Health Service took to the blockchain as a means of monitoring stores of COVID-19 vaccine.

Other major companies added to the list this year include Binance, for supporting over 100 blockchains on their exchange, MicroStrategy, for buying more than $1 billion in BTC during 2020, and Kakao, South Korea’s biggest messaging app, for developing its own cryptocurrency called “klay.”","['forbes', 'underlying', 'global', 'additions', 'chain', 'projects', 'tracking', 'added', 'companies', 'supply', 'blockchain', 'using', 'dominate', 'chains', '50', 'technology', 'logistics']","More than half of companies added to the Forbes Blockchain 50 list for the first time this year are using tblockchain to resolve logistical issues faced in their line of business.

A Feb. 3 tweet from MicroStrategy CEO, Michael Saylor, said that representatives of more than 1,400 firms have already signed up for the event — which is dubbed “Bitcoin for Corporations: Legal Considerations.”

If you are interested in the legal considerations firms face while integrating #Bitcoin into their corporate strategy, you are not alone. We have professionals from more than 1400 firms joining us tomorrow for this discussion. There is still time for your legal team to attend. https://t.co/fid9nrZUfP — Michael Saylor (@michael_saylor) February 2, 2021

The seminar will take place on Feb. 3 and Feb. 4, with five one-hour sessions scheduled for the first day, and twice as many 30-minute sessions slated for the second.

The first day will feature presentations from Saylor, the firm’s president and CFO Phong Le, along with representatives of legal firms specializing in digital assets. The topics discussed will include strategies for incorporating Bitcoin into treasury reserves and related questions regarding the accounting, tax, legal, and auditing considerations for firms who pursue this strategy.

The second day will feature presentations from top crypto exchanges and fund managers, including Coinbase, Binance, Grayscale, and Galaxy Digital.

In August, MicroStrategy made headlines after revealing it had purchased 21,000 BTC for $250 million. The following month, Saylor announced the firm had purchased an additional 16,796 Bitcoin for $175 million, with the firm continuously purchasing roughly 0.19 BTC every three seconds over 74 hours to complete the transaction.

In December, MicroStrategy issued $650 million worth of bonds which were quickly mobilized to purchase 29,646 BTC. The firm purchased an additional 314 Bitcoin for $10 million in late January, and a further 295 BTC for $10 million this week, bringing its Bitcoin reserves up to 71,079 BTC, or 0.38% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply.

While MicroStrategy paid $1.095 billion to accumulate its BTC holdings, current prices value the stash at $2.57 billion — a gain of 135%.

In an interview with Forbes, Mayor Francis Suarez said tangible paths to expand Bitcoin's adoption throughout the city included enabling city employee salaries to be paid in BTC.

Major figures in the cryptocurrency world have responded positively to the idea, with Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey calling it “smart” on Twitter.

Germini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss stated that the mayor is “leading the way for governments and Bitcoin.”

Mayor Suarez told Forbes that due to the rise in crypto’s popularity among citizens, he wants to do everything he can to make Miami a Bitcoin-friendly city. Other proposals include allowing local fees and taxes to be paid in Bitcoin and certain other cryptocurrencies, as well as investing some of the city’s treasury into Bitcoin, following Microstrategy’s example.

Although he isn’t sure of specific amounts, Suarez explained that the treasury investment would be structured as a public-private partnership, with the private partners receiving some of the rewards for alleviating some of the risks.

He also revealed that he’s also considering financing his reelection campaign in Bitcoin. He isn’t the first to turn to Bitcoin to help fund political campaigns with Democrat Andrew Yang, California U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell, Minnesota U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer, and Libertarian Lara Loomer among U.S. politicians who have already accepted cryptocurrencies in past campaigns.

The mayor believes Bitcoin will be the “biggest story for the next few years.”

Late last year the mayor called Bitcoin a “stable investment” during an “incredibly unstable year.” Last week, he uploaded Bitcoin’s whitepaper onto the government’s website saying:

“The City of Miami believes in Bitcoin and I’m working day and night to turn Miami into a hub for crypto innovation.”

The mayor told Forbes that he has reached out to other states and jurisdictions, including Caitlin Long in Wyoming and Florida CFO Jimmy Patronis to help drive Bitcoin-friendly changes in Florida’s legislature. These efforts are part of the city’s push to be the next major tech hub in the U.S. with plans to grow innovation and tech growth in the next few years.

Should these actions take effect, Miami’s 450,000 citizens may be encouraged to start transacting in Bitcoin on a regular basis, with the potential for this to spread to the rest of Florida’s 21.5 million residents. It would also make the city more attractive for blockchain-related tech companies and events.

Although Miami may be the first U.S. city to offer employees salaries in Bitcoin, other companies have also been exploring this. Last week, Cointelegraph reported that software development services provider Sequoia Holdings, based in Virginia, is offering employees the ability to sacrifice a portion of their salary to invest in either Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), or Ether (ETH).","['salaries', 'able', 'forbes', 'miami', 'employees', 'suarez', 'bitcoin', 'mayor', 'city', 'tech', 'paid']","Miami city employees could soon choose to get their salaries paid in Bitcoin rather than USD.

Multiple metrics like the increasing amount of Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) locked in DeFi, soaring transaction and on-chain activity and the plummeting BTC and Ether reserves of top exchanges show that investors are becoming increasingly interested in cryptocurrency.

Data from CryptoQuant, an on-chain analytics firm, shows that as Ether (ETH) established a new all-time high above $1,500 on Feb. 2, the amount of Ether held on all centralized exchange’s reserves continued to drop to new lows as token holders withdrew their coins.

Many analysts believe that the rapidly expanding DeFi sector, launch of Eth2 and increasing participation from institutional investors are the primary reasons for the drop in BTC and Ether held on centralized exchanges.

The rise of DeFi and yield farming

Each week the number of participants interacting with the DeFi sector seems to reach a new high and as of Feb. 2, the total value locked in DeFi platforms has reached $28.67 billion.

Data from Defi Pulse shows that the majority of DeFi platforms are built on the Ethereum network and require Ether to transact with the protocol.

In addition to offering attractive ways to earn a yield from simply lending Ether, an increasing amount of the available supply is being directed towards DeFi-related activities and not available for trading purposes.

A similar phenomenon is happening with BTC as holders looking to participate in the DeFi space without selling their Bitcoin have been wrapping them into ERC-20 synthetic versions of Ether.

Platforms like REN and BadgerDAO lead in this effort and a similar drain on the available Bitcoin supply could also be helping to push the price of BTC higher.

Eth2 and extended lock-up staking

Since the launch of the Beacon chain on Dec. 1, 2020, the Eth2 contract has enabled token holders to stake their Ether in the new PoS contract by becoming validators for the network.

Data from the Eth2 Launch Pad shows that there are currently 2,907,298 Ether worth a total of $4.39 billion staked on the network earning an estimated APR of 9.2%

The contract has a multi-year commitment but for holders who refuse to stomach the risk and volatility of DeFi yield farming, Eth2 staking offers a way to earn a yield over time rather than let tokens sit on exchanges or in cold wallets.

Institutional investors begin to see the value proposition of Ether

Since 2020, Bitcoin has received the lion’s share of attention from the institutional investment crowd as investors like MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor lead the way by buying up immense sums of Bitcoin and tweeting non-stop about its estimated future value.

Now that Bitcoin is more than a decade old and seen as more established, firms are increasingly open to looking for the next big opportunity that the cryptocurrency sector has to offer. With the explosion of DeFi and its current dependence on the Ethereum network, Ether is quickly becoming a recommended choice for the institutional investors.

Grayscale Investments temporarily closed their various crypto trusts to new investments in late December following the rise in the price of Bitcoin, but inflow resumed in early January and their total Ether holdings have increased by 242% over the past 3 months.

Coinbase also noted in its annual 2020 review that institutional investors are increasingly seeing Ether as a store of value with “a growing number” of its institutional clients taking a position in the token due to the strong returns offered.

The exchange also noted that while a majority of their clients bought BTC throughout 2020, Ether’s strong finish to the year saw it surpass BTC in terms of price growth and this is a trend which has continued into 2021.

As Bitcoin’s institutional adoption increases, United States companies may start to diversify their treasury with other stores of value, and Bitcoin (BTC) stands a good chance to garner a portion of it.

Ark Invest’s latest report, ""Bitcoin: Preparing for Institutions,"" shows that even a paltry allocation of 1% by companies from the S&P 500 could boost Bitcoin’s price by $40,000. However, analysts at Ar believe that the allocation is likely to be in the range of 2.5% to 6.5%, which ""could impact bitcoin’s price by $200,000 to $500,000.""

Even as Bitcoin’s price consolidates and readies for the next leg up, several altcoins have been rising, backed by strong fundamentals and investors' high expectations of their upcoming products. Let’s look at three such tokens today.

BAND/USD

The decentralized finance space has boomed in the past few months, and the success of the protocols rely heavily upon data sources that are decentralized, fast and reliable. This is where Band Protocol steps in. The cross-chain data oracle has announced several partnerships in the past few days, which shows it is gradually building its market share.

The strong rally in stocks such as GameStop, AMC and others have captured traders' attention in the past few days. Band’s tie-up with Injective Protocol to deliver decentralized price oracles for various stocks to be supported on the decentralized derivatives platform could benefit the price of its native token, BAND, as a successful integration would be followed by an increase in demand.

Similarly, Linear Finance, a derivatives asset protocol, will also use Band’s real-time price feeds to offer its clients a seamless trading experience for several synthetic assets.

Band is not limited to only providing price feeds of cryptocurrencies, foreign exchange assets and commodities. Elrond and Band have expanded their partnership further to bridge the two networks to provide off-chain data to various applications being developed on the Elrond network. Other than the usual price feeds, Band will also cater to data requests for sports, gaming, esports and much more.

Along with these, Band has also entered into partnerships with the Moonbeam protocol, Nervos and Fantom in the past few days and broadened its existing partnership with CoinGecko.

BAND price rose from $7.1532 on Jan. 22 to $12.949 on Tuesday, an 81% rally within a short time. Previous to this move, the price had largely been stuck in the range of $7 to $11.50 for the past few days.

BAND/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls pushed the price above the range on Tuesday, but the long wick on the day’s candlestick shows the bears are aggressively selling at higher levels. This has dragged the price back into the aforementioned trading range.

If the bulls do not give up much ground, then one more attempt to break above the range is likely. The 20-day exponential moving average ($9.28) has started to turn up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive territory, which suggests that the path of least resistance is to the upside.

If the bulls can drive and sustain the price above $11.50, the BAND/USD pair could rally to $16 and then to $17.78. This zone may act as stiff resistance, but if the bulls can propel the price above it, the momentum could further pick up.

Contrary to this assumption, if the bears successfully defend the $11.50–$12.949 resistance zone, the pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.

LRC/USD

The GameStop saga and the trading limits imposed on retail traders by brokerages like Robinhood have exposed their significant flaws. This is likely to draw traders to decentralized exchanges where control does not lie with any central entity.

Transaction fees are an extremely important aspect during trading, especially for smaller-sized traders. So, when Ethereum gas fees increase, these retail traders are the most affected. Loopring attempts to solve this problem with it layer-two scaling.

Data from Dune Analytics shows that Loopring’s fee collection recently surged to its highest-ever level due to increasing volume. The protocol recently updated its LRC tokenomics model and announced a new fee distribution pattern to its various participants. This could further attract LRC investors who may want to benefit from the rising popularity of the protocol.

LRC rose from an intraday low at $0.33651 on Jan. 22 to an intraday high at $0.57618 on Jan. 31, a 71% rally within a few days. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls are in control.

LRC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The up-move is currently facing resistance near $0.55, and the LRC/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($0.43). This is an important level to watch out for because the pair has taken support at the 20-day EMA on three previous occasions.

If the pair again rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $0.62167. If they succeed, the pair could rally to $0.71773 and then to $0.78.

This bullish view will invalidate if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that the bulls are not buying the dips anymore, and that could result in a fall to $0.35 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($0.31).

CREAM/USD

Certain aspects of traditional finance could act as an inspiration to build projects in the decentralized space. Cream Finance recently announced the launch of Iron Bank, which is guided by the success of the $10-trillion U.S. corporate debt market.

While there are several peer-to-peer lending protocols existing in the crypto space, Cream has taken it a step further and created a protocol-to-protocol lending mechanism. The main attraction of the Iron Bank is that it will facilitate zero-collateral lending.

To keep the risk under check, Cream will set a credit limit after whitelisting the protocols. Initially, the Iron Bank is available only for Cream’s partners, but if this project succeeds, it is likely to be a huge positive for the entire DeFi space.

In other news, Cream recently widened its services by adding SushiSwap and Uniswap LP tokens as collateral options for lending and borrowing.

The platform's CREAM token rallied from $119.35 on Jan. 22 to an intraday high at $319.9 on Tuesday, a 168% rally within a short time. The long wick on the day’s candlestick shows that traders aggressively booked profits at higher levels.

CREAM/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the bulls do not allow the price to dip below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $251.65, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. The upsloping 20-day EMA ($181) and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest the advantage to the bulls.

If the bulls can push and sustain the price above $294.80, the CREAM/USD pair could rally to $362 and then to $430.

Conversely, if the bears sink the price below $251.65, the pair could dip to the 61.8% retracement level at $209.45.

According to a report by the American political publication Politico, Tenev is expected to participate in a virtual hearing headed by Representative Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) on Feb. 18. Politico’s report cited anonymous people familiar with the matter.

Waters officially announced the Financial Services Committee’s plans to hold a GameStop-related hearing on Feb. 18. Entitled “Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide,” the hearing will focus on recent market volatility issues involving GameStop and other stocks.

“I am concerned about whether or not Robinhood restricted the trading because there was collusion between Robinhood and some of the hedge funds that were involved with this,” Waters reportedly said.

The announcement did not specify what witnesses will participate in the hearing. Robinhood has not officially announced Tenev’s participation so far. The firm did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.

As previously reported, some U.S. regulators have already drawn attention to Robinhood’s handling the GameStop short squeeze. On Jan. 29, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission hinted that it was looking at Robinhood’s issues with GameStop, expressing concern over “extreme price volatility of certain stocks’ trading prices.”

Robinhood’s GameStop saga started on Jan. 28 when the company suspended buying for GameStop stock and other shares that were allegedly pumped through the r/Wallstreetbets Reddit community. Robinhood subsequently restricted trading for as many as 50 stocks on Friday before narrowing the restrictions to eight stocks on Feb. 8. Still, Robinhood users are limited to just one GameStop share.

On Feb. 1, Robinhood’s Tenev discussed the firm’s move to restrict trading with Elon Musk on the audio chat app Clubhouse. Tenev reportedly said that the decision about restrictions was made by a clearinghouse and was based on the capital requirements. He also denied allegations that trading firm Citadel Securities — the largest market maker in options in the U.S. — had pushed the firm to impose the limits.","['stocks', 'robinhoods', 'feb', 'gamestop', 'reportedly', 'committee', 'hearing', 'tenev', 'testify', 'ceo', 'house', 'trading', 'robinhood', 'firm']","Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev will reportedly testify before the United States House Financial Services Committee over the firm’s role in the volatile trading of GameStop and other volatile stocks.

According to its website, Robinhood has lowered its list of restrictions to eight different stocks including GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, Express, Genius Brands International, Koss, Naked Brand Group and Nokia. Robinhood previously limited trading for as many as 50 stocks on Friday, CNBC reported.

As per the new restrictions, Robinhood users can still only buy one share of GameStop alongside five options contracts. AMC trading is capped at 10 shares and 10 options contracts.

Robinhood users who already hold a greater number of shares or contracts will have to sell their holdings in order to open more positions, the firm said:

“If you already hold a greater number of shares or contracts than the limits listed above, your positions will not be sold or closed. However, you will not be able to open more positions of each of these securities unless you sell enough of your holdings such that you are below the respective limit.”

Robinhood has been struggling to maintain its trading services while the r/Wallstreetbets Reddit community pumps stocks like GME to new all-time highs. On Thursday, Robinhood suspended GME purchases after the stock skyrocketed 1,400% from about $20 on Jan. 12. On Friday, the firm also temporarily disabled instant deposits for cryptocurrency purchases, citing “extraordinary market conditions.”

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission subsequently hinted that it was looking into the Robinhood platform, citing concerns over “extreme price volatility of certain stocks’ trading prices.”

Robinhood’s decision to halt GME trading was widely criticized in the trading community, with at least 100,000 negative reviews appearing on Robinhood’s page on the Google Play Store. Despite Google’s subsequent move to scrap thousands of negative reviews with its “fake review” tracking system, Robinhood app’s rating is still down to one star, with 294,954 reviews posted at publishing time.

Amid the ongoing issues, Robinhood users launched the “#robinhoodboycott” tag on Twitter, calling on traders to move their holdings off the platform. However, Robinhood is not the only company experiencing issues due to the GameStop short squeeze. On Saturday, online trading platform IG Group Holdings said that it will restrict any new positions on GME and AMC due to “extreme volatility” in the market.","['platform', 'holdings', 'stocks', 'gme', 'gamestop', 'limited', 'shares', 'trading', 'robinhood', 'users', 'positions', 'share']","Troubled trading app Robinhood has been narrowing the list of restricted stocks on its platform but is still keeping major restrictions on GameStop shares.

In his letter to employees, Bezos said that he would be transitioning to the role of executive chair of the Amazon board, where he would “focus my energies and attention on new products and early initiatives.” The transition is scheduled for later in the year.

Bezos also noted that Jassy “will be an outstanding leader, and has my full confidence.”

The crypto world’s attention now turns to Jassy’s history when it comes to embracing blockchain technology, as it could be an indication of the long-term crypto strategy of the world’s third-most valuable company by market capitalization.

Jassy offered a mixed review of blockchain technology and its applicability to Amazon's business in 2017. In a statement at the Amazon ""re:Invent"" conference, he expressed doubt that blockchain could be used for more than a “distributed ledger” but also said he and his team were personally interested. However, company policy dictated that they don't “build technology [just] because we think it is cool.”

He did leave the door open for future exploration, however, saying, “We are very intrigued by what customers are ultimately going to do there.”

In 2018, Jassy did move forward with a “quasi-blockchain” offering, as he oversaw the launch of two blockchain products: Amazon Quantum Ledger Database and Amazon Managed Blockchain. As Cointelegraph reported, the products maintained centralized databases but included cryptographic qualities.

Aside from these forays, Amazon has largely only made crypto headlines as a scapegoat: In November 2020, Coinbase blamed an AWS outage for one of its frequent service interruptions.

“Buy crypto” searches on Google surged to all-time highs in January, far exceeding the previous peak of early 2018, according to cryptocurrency analytics company The Tie.

Relative search interest for the term ""Buy Crypto"" is at all-time high on Google Trends pic.twitter.com/4cFIkI0xbp — The TIE (@TheTIEIO) February 1, 2021

The keyword received a perfect Google Trends score of 100, which indicates maximum relative interest.

A similar spike was also observed for Ethereum, which achieved a perfect score of 100 before falling back down to a still-strong 65.

Bitcoin (BTC) searches also spiked, but remain well below the 2017 bull market high.

The Tie also shared the following chart with Cointelegraph, which highlights a sharp rise in searches for “best crypto app” and “best crypto exchange.”

“Relative search interest for popular crypto terms is at an all-time high on Google Trends,” Treyce Dahlem, research analyst at The Tie, to Cointelegraph.

He continued:

“Whether this is due to the recent price rallies that we’ve seen, speculative traders from Reddit looking to leave their mark on more assets, or even a macro shift in the way investors are searching for a hedge against inflation, one thing is clear: There is a rapidly growing interest in crypto and new investors are looking for the best way to get into the ecosystem.”

The explosive search trends seem to coincide with growing retail interest in both Ethereum and altcoins. Ether’s (ETH) price has doubled since the start of the year, having just reached a new all-time high above $1,500.

Meanwhile, the overall cryptocurrency market in January reached $1 trillion for the first time. While the initial spike was largely due to Bitcoin, altcoins have supported the trillion-dollar valuation with greater intensity over the past month. In the process, Bitcoin’s dominance rate has fallen to 62% from a high of 72% in early January.

Google search trends are sometimes correlated with movements in the overall cryptocurrency market. Higher relative searches signal growing retail awareness of digital assets, which is often a precursor to wider speculative adoption.

The Tie revealed to Cointelegraph that social media engagement surrounding crypto has also skyrocketed. On Twitter, aggregate tweet volumes devoted to cryptocurrency reached 3.3 million in January, up from 1.3 million in September 2020.

According to an announcement from Cash App, its clearing broker, Axos, halted the app’s ability to complete purchases of stocks for GameStop, AMC Entertainment, Nokia and Koss Corporation — at least four of the stocks pushed by retail investors on the r/Wallstreetbets subreddit in their fight against hedge funds’ shorts. However, the app later tweeted that the broker has restored trading for AMC and Nokia.

Cash App initially said that it “wholeheartedly” disagreed with Axos’ actions and added that it would attempt to allow users to purchase all the affected stocks “as soon as possible.” The platform has not mentioned any change in the status of trading GameStop and Koss Corporation stocks, but the price of GME fell under $100 for the first time in a week, reaching $99.50 at the time of publication.

Though it appeared that Cash App was trying to distance itself from any possible allegations of market manipulation in the wake of the GameStop short sells, the restrictions on buys were similar to those imposed by other trading apps last week.

Robinhood announced on Thursday that it had suspended buying for GameStop stock and others after many of the stocks surged. The trading app has since lowered these restrictions, but its users are still limited to buying one GME share as of yesterday.

Many on social media seemed to place the blame for restricting trading on Axos rather than Cash App, but they still expressed their frustration after the parallels with Robinhood.

The excitement surrounding this project has electrified several major Chinese cities, as well as onlookers throughout the world.

Most recently, Shenzhen launched its “iShenzhen” lottery, wherein the city government will distribute 20 million digital yuan among 100,000 central bank digital currency, or CBDC, wallet holders. This comes on the back of a similar lottery held in the city of Suzhou, one of China’s major “special economic zones.” Suzhou has already engaged with several blockchain projects in an effort to deepen the municipality’s understanding and use of decentralized technology, smart contracts and the general learning curve the local population may face.

As China continues to cement itself in the international economy, it is proving to be a leader in the race toward CBDC adoption, an initiative that would make Chinese goods and services more accessible within the global marketplace. Many experts in the fields of fiscal policy and financial technology have argued that the digitization of public money is an inevitable consequence of distributed ledger technology.

The particular political and economic ramifications of this switch to digital currency will depend on the specific decisions of governments regarding their approaches to these new technologies. China, for example, has adopted an approach that has seen repeated success throughout contemporary business culture.

A number of other nations, with economies of all sizes, are more or less waiting in the wings as the People’s Bank of China demonstrates its leadership. In the Suzhou and Shenzhen experiments, citizens are allotted digital yuan and encouraged to link their digital wallets to their existing PBoC accounts, and if they do not use the digital currency within a few weeks, it disappears.

Nations are especially eager to see how this program unfolds and how adoption looks at the grassroots level. Businesses and governments have a natural incentive to embrace this technology, as it reduces overhead and friction, which enhances their bottom line. However, for citizens whose motives might not be tied to financial gain, which other incentives will prompt them to start using an entirely different system of money and banking? These aforementioned adoption trends will be a key driver that determines how quickly other nations will begin developing their own CBDCs.

Related: Did CBDCs affect the crypto space in 2020, and what’s next in 2021? Experts answer

Smaller nations have a better chance for quicker launches

This experiment has excited economic participation within China and roused interest from public banks across the world. Which countries have positioned themselves to follow China into the digital future? Certainly, China’s influence, as well as a long-standing pro-technology culture throughout the continent, suggests that many East Asian countries may follow suit. The Bank of Thailand launched a CBDC pilot program back in June 2020. Moreover, just last fall, the Bank of Korea announced plans for a 2021 CBDC issuance, while Japanese banking officials have articulated a more cautious, passive course of interest following China’s CBDC.

Smaller nations, of course, have a different set of obstacles in their financial experimentation. Recently, the Bahamas introduced its “Sand Dollar” and Cambodia its “Bakong,” following China’s example. This is made possible, however, by the smaller size of these national banking systems that allow them to move with greater agility as well as a degree of autonomy. This becomes an advantage for smaller nations, as the global dependence on their currency is also smaller, so the interoperability issues are of a lesser priority than for global economies like the United States and China where it becomes a highly critical aspect.

However, larger nations are also showing greater interest. A year-long research report published recently by the central banks of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates shows that the early adoption of digital currencies is favorable — particularly for major economies that have operated with relatively higher degrees of autonomy, unlike those in the eurozone or a part of the North American Free Trade Association, for example. Like China, the Saudi and Emirati governments, given their manufacturing and natural resources, do not accrue as much debt as is standard in other major economies in the West.

This brings to light an interesting aspect of CBDC adoption, one that may influence the process of digitization across the world’s public banks. While a huge number of factors determine how and when a particular economy may adopt digital currency — such as its size, the preexisting economic landscape, its gross domestic product, etc. — an important aspect seems to be a strong national (as opposed to global) economic program. This is interesting not only because it flags particular nations as being predisposed to CBDCs but also because it highlights the importance of interoperability after a currency has been instituted. These digitization programs, in other words, will be brought about through strong national economic policy control, but in order to uphold the global systems that we live in, these technologies will need to interact through intermediary programs.

Interoperability is highly critical for major economies

With a push to all the global CBDC initiatives, the Bank of International Settlements’ Innovation Hub, or BISIH, announced that CBDC research is a top priority for it in 2021. It plans to gauge the feasibility of faster, cheaper cross-border payments. This initiative is going to be highly beneficial for global economies exploring the interoperability of their own CBDC projects using BISIH research and pilot tests to facilitate their own CBDC program and by working with them for all settlements and cross-border payment concerns.

While focusing on domestic use cases is understandable for individual countries, CBDCs will only ever operate in local sandboxes unless there is some type of interoperable protocol. It is critical to bridge the gaps between the various CBDC initiatives and existing payments systems as well as other digital currencies to ensure their success on a global scale.

While governments exploring the use of CBDCs is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, truly borderless, global commerce will be powered with the help of an interoperable protocol, as our economic system is too multifaceted to be replaced by a singular currency.

The move marks a major step for the fledgling DeFi sector and more fixed-rate lending protocols in DeFi may attract additional users seeking mostability in longer-term investments and loans, such as mortgages. Currently, the ecosystem is largely populated by yield farmers looking for quick gains on their crypto collateral.

The DeFi engineer attempted the process through TradFi by seeking an offset loan, which directs a savings account’s interest towards paying down a mortgage.

Speaking to The Defiant, however, the borrower stated that banks are very cautious about lending in times of economic uncertainty, especially to those that are self-employed. He added that he had been rejected for a basic credit card for four years.

Notional Finance provides fixed-rate loans for up to six months for users that deposit crypto collateral in wrapped BTC, ETH, wrapped ETH, or DAI.

The approach was far from simple and user-friendly for noobs, however. The engineer had to pay off his bank loan first in AUD. He then had to borrow the USD pegged stablecoin USDC from Notional at a fixed rate, providing his own liquidity to avoid the slippage and fees on the new low volume platform.

He then added around $1 million in wBTC and wETH as collateral to Notional against which he borrowed around $500,000 of USDC which was converted to AUD to pay off the bank. He said:

“I feel like I’m in full control of my situation. People should be all over this stuff.”

Borrowing rates on Notional Finance for USDC are approximately 6% but some of that can be recouped by earnings from liquidity provision. There is the added bonus of maintaining a position in a bull market without having to sell crypto assets and incur a capital gains event upon which there would have been taxes to pay.

He added that the process was fast compared to traditional finance;

“It felt like it would’ve taken months of applications, finding tax returns and bank statements for the bank to refinance me, but I was able to do it all in one day, under my own agency,”

Leading DeFi protocol Aave has also started down the mortgage path with its latest partnership. In an announcement on Feb. 2, Aave stated that the scheme was in collaboration with RealT, a firm that tokenizes real estate in order to allow users to stake their property as collateral to take out loans. The ability to use these assets as collateral is the first step in making “mortgage” loans on Ethereum available to a wider audience.","['bank', 'usdc', 'single', 'defi', 'mortgage', 'day', 'loans', 'collateral', 'added', 'notional', 'users', 'pioneering', 'aussie', 'using', 'engineer', 'loan', 'refinances']","The move marks a major step for the fledgling DeFi sector and more fixed-rate lending protocols in DeFi may attract additional users seeking mostability in longer-term investments and loans, such as mortgages.

Nic Carter, a former Fidelity crypto asset analyst and Castle Island Ventures partner, slammed the Wall Street Journal article titled “Behind the Bitcoin Bubble” by Andy Kessler, alleging that it verged on “journalistic malpractice”.

“Normally, if you are a columnist writing in one of the most respected financial publications, you might try and evaluate the data behind that claim, instead of just uncritically accepting it. But Mr. Kessler did no such thing. He just blindly repeated a fanciful claim from an anonymous blogger in order to imply that Bitcoin’s price was somehow dependent on Tether.”

The award-winning WSJ writer based some of his fairly extensive criticism on the work of a blogger called “CryptoAnon” in a viral post called “The Bit Short: Inside Crypto’s Doomsday Machine”. Kessler wrote the blogger had ""found that as much as two-thirds of Bitcoin buys on any given day were purchased with Tether"" based on CoinLib data.

Raising questions over Tether and its lack of audits and the idea USDT was being employed to buy Bitcoin to ""jack up its price,"" Kessler added;

“Normally I wouldn’t care. Bitcoin is nothing, it’s vapor, a concept of an idea. Transactions using Bitcoin are few and far between. It’s not a store of value—anything that drops 30% in a week can’t play that role.”

Kessler said he must also note that ""wallet provider Coinbase, the largest holder of Bitcoin, says it 'does not support USDT.' Do they know something? (Coinbase offers its own stablecoin USDC, in partnership with Circle.)

Carter, who is now board chair at Coin Metrics, wrote that assessing trade between USDT and Bitcoin using data called CoinLib was “indefensible” as it included tens of billions of wash trading data from exchanges that reputable data sources ignore.

He said any serious trader knows that “many of the exchanges composing the CoinLib sample are not credible, and that the resultant data was thus completely unreliable.”

“As I will demonstrate, this data is not sufficient to make the case that Bitcoin liquidity is dominated by Tether, and relying on it is liable to mislead. Unfortunately, the mainstream financial press is now amplifying these erroneous claims.”

Carter stated that CoinLib is taking the data outputs from marginal and often non-fiat connected Tether based exchanges as face value, and “unsophisticated analysts like CryptoAnon” are using it to disseminate FUD about Bitcoin’s liquidity.

He argued that highly regulated exchanges and institutional fund providers do not rely on or even support Tether in some cases and they all facilitate an on-ramp to Bitcoin and support the price.

“Other entities like Cash App, Paxos, Paypal, BlockFi, Robinhood, Bitwise, and Grayscale all facilitate various forms of exposure to Bitcoin and are connected to the commercial bank system and in some cases publicly-traded companies. No Tether present.”

Carter concludes that Kessler needs more research and called for a retraction and a correction by the WSJ:

According to Fox Business Network’s Charles Gasparino, sources inside Robinhood say the company’s only focus is surviving the fallout from the drama it currently finds itself engulfed in, and will pause its plans for an IPO launch for now.

As reported by Techcrunch, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev was quizzed by none other than Elon Musk on invite-only app Clubhouse, where Tenev revealed the extent of the firm’s losses.

According to Tenev, he woke up early on Jan. 28 to find a bill from the National Securities Clearing Corporation for the sum of $3 billion, payable immediately. Providing context for that number, Tenev said:

“Robinhood up until that point has raised around $2 billion in total venture capital. Up until now, so it’s a big number, like $3 billion is a large number, right.”

The Wall Street Journal reported on Feb. 1 that Robinhood had raised another $2.4 billion from investors, taking the total sum of money raised since last Thursday to $3.4 billion. Yet despite apparently having no problems with liquidity, the firm appears to have reasoned that its current public perception would not be conducive to a successful IPO.

Indeed, a vast majority of surveyed professionals believe that Robinhood has ruined its chances of launching an IPO due to its behavior during the recent GameStop saga.

An anonymous survey conducted via the Blind networking forum asked 8,750 verified professionals from major tech and financial services companies if they thought Robinhood had “screwed its IPO”. The results revealed that 83% thought the firm’s chances of a successful initial public offering had been irreparably damaged.

The response given by 37 Robinhood employees surveyed was markedly different. Just 13.5% believe the company has killed the possibility of ever seeing a successful IPO launch, while 86.5% believe it can still go ahead.

A self-effacing comment from a Facebook employee expressed the view that the IPO could still go ahead, but that Robinhood would forever suffer the same negative public opinion as the ubiquitous social media giant. They wrote:

“Robinhood is the next Facebook. Something tons of people will use but has a negative undertone and brand.”

Public opinion soured on Robinhood following the company’s decision to ban retail buy orders in the middle of the Reddit-inspired “short squeeze” on GameStop. Sharp-eyed observers were quick to point out the possible conflict of interest at play given 35% of Robinhood’s revenue came from the same firm which suffered heavy losses at the hands of r/Wallstreetbets organized band of collective traders.

Robinhood has since stated that the only reason it halted retail buy orders was because it couldn’t cover its commitments to the NSCC, which demands that each day’s trading liabilities are covered in full.

The company was contacted for comment, but had not replied by time of publication.","['opinion', 'tenev', 'shelves', 'reportedly', 'gamestop', 'pr', 'billion', 'public', 'disaster', 'plans', 'robinhood', 'ipo', 'raised', 'trading', 'successful', 'wake']","Trading app Robinhood may have put its plans for an initial public offering on hold after public opinion turned against the company in the wake of its response to the short squeeze on GameStop (GME).

XRP’s legal woes may place a damper on the rally

In the past few months, XRP price has been hard hit due to a lawsuit filed against Ripple by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC alleges that the company is conducting an ongoing illegal securities offering as Ripple still periodically sells XRP tokens out of the treasury.

Ripple recently filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the SEC seeking documents pertaining to Ethereum co-founders.

For the influencers and Wall Street Bets refugees who joined in on the rise — many of whom were taking their first ride on what’s known to be a notoriously volatile chart — the price action reversal has been especially harrowing.

Doge doing what it does best, welcoming people into crypto with a huge slap in the face. https://t.co/0GpiKe4B8U — RyanJK (@RJ_Kunz) January 30, 2021

Just yesterday, Dogecoin made history for cracking the top 10 cryptoassets by marketcap for the first time since 2015. The currency named after a dog meme that was started as a joke was propelled to such lofty heights on the back of similarly record-breaking social media volume, according to analytics provided by The TIE.

While some tied the rapid price appreciation to Elon Musk memes and the inevitable groupthink of crypto’s often momentum-based markets, $DOGE’s success may also be rooted in anti-establishment sentiments running rife through the retail crowd following popular trading app Robinhood disabling ‘Buy’ orders for certain assets.

The move from Robinhood and other brokers prompted furious accusations of hypocrisy and speculation that hedge funds were being favored over smaller investors — and what's a better way to highlight a broken system than pumping a joke coin to a multi-billion dollar valuation?

However, after reports of withdrawal issues on multiple centralized exchanges, Dogecoin has undergone a violent overnight reversal, leading many buyers to take to social media to express their regret. Just a few hours after posting that she’d “finally caved and bought the dog stock,” podcast host and media personality Mia Khalifa indicated some buyer’s remorse:

Khalifa wasn’t alone in feeling the pain. Multiple streamers and social media influencers had been along for the ride, and stream viewers last night witnessed some wondering if a “nuke” had gone off:

However, the new coin appears to be the latest in a series of jokes played by the CoinMarketCap team. The coin’s page on CMC features the following message:

“All UR MeMes R belong to us and Charmander-marth!!11. We seek alpha and master beta. Please note that this is a joke and no such asset exists. If you see similarly-named projects, please perform the requisite due diligence and do not ape in.”

The reference to Charmander-marth links to a YouTube video featuring Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya being interviewed by CNBC regarding his successful trading of GameStop stocks during the short-squeeze initiated by the r/Wallstreetbets subreddit.

The coin’s CMC page offers up a brief timeline of the GameStop saga, describing the short-squeeze tactic and the subsequent effect it had on the Robinhood trading app, which suspended retail trading for GameStop and several other stocks, including AMC, Nokia and Blackberry.

Once the massive pump lost momentum and traders quickly took profits, it seemed that investors would move on past the meme-based cryptocurrency and find something else to invest in.

The pump initially started when exchanges prevented retail traders from buying more GameStop and AMC stock on Jan. 28. Fueled by the Reddit discussion group r/Wallstreetbets, the army of investors turned their attention to silver and a selection of ‘cheap’ cryptocurrenceis.

On Jan.28, Twitter user ""WSB Chairman"" asked, ""Has Doge ever been to a dollar?"" to his 750,000 followers. That was enough to trigger the monster rally, despite Dogecoin having no protocol upgrades or developments since 2015.

The 68% retracement that followed the peak at $0.087 resembled Bitcoin's (BTC) sharp drop after the December 2017 crash, except this time around, instead of 50 days, it took only 24 hours.

Multiple social media influencers and streamers expressed their discontent at buying the top, an indication that the momentary speculative frenzy had passed. After spending most of Jan. 30 and Jan. 31 hovering around $0.03, DOGE managed to produce another 80% pump in less than three hours.

It's almost impossible to find the exact trigger for those events, as there are multiple social networks, including private Telegram groups and trading signal apps.

Reddit's r/SatoshiStreetBets currently has 213,000 active users and following DOGE’s breakout a meme-post by user Woke_AF_Populist quickly climbed to its most upvoted list.

There seems to be endless support from the Dogecoin fanbase, including Tesla's CEO and founder Elon Musk. The lack of a concrete use case for the meme-coin certainly raises the question of whether members of r/WallStreetBets will jump ship from traditional markets and embrace the generally unregulated ethos of the cryptocurrency sector.

Dogecoin already has something in common with $GME, both assets having seen publicity tweets from Tesla CEO and world's richest man, Elon Musk in recent weeks. As Cointelegraph reported, Musk's tongue-in-cheek endorsement of DOGE was enough to induce serious price action.

The most-traded Bitcoin product in centralized exchanges is Bitcoin futures, which is 10 times bigger than spot trading in terms of the trading volume. But on DEXs, spot trading platforms, such as Uniswap, occupy a large portion of the total trading volume, and there is not a single decentralized futures trading platform that could reach even one-10th of Uniswap’s trading volume. What stops decentralized futures trading platforms from becoming 10 times bigger than Uniswap? Why are decentralized futures trading platforms performing worse than their centralized counterparts?

The main reason is that decentralized futures exchanges don’t currently provide an attractive futures product to compete with centralized futures exchanges. For instance, centralized futures exchanges, such as BitMEX, can provide 100 times leverage on Bitcoin futures trading. On the other hand, decentralized futures exchanges, such as dYdX, only offer 10 times leverage. None of the decentralized exchanges can keep up with the 100x leverage offering from centralized exchanges.

YFX Descartes V1 uses QIC-AMM and a system de-risk mechanism to migrate perpetual futures trading from CEXs to DEXs without reducing the trading leverage, which makes YFX the first DEX that could offer 100x leverage on a perpetual contract. You can do everything on YFX you normally do on BitMEX or OKEx. YFX is poised to compete directly against established centralized exchanges. YFX Descartes V1 runs on both Huobi Heco Chain and Tron for faster transaction times and cheaper gas fees compared to Ethereum. The YFX team is also working on Ethereum’s layer-two solution to provide pragmatic perpetual trading on DEXs. The YFX team plans to launch its DEX on the Ethereum testnet in Q1, 2021.

About YFX

YFX is the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts. YFX Descartes V1 launched on both Huobi Heco Chain and Tron, and all trades are held and processed by smart contracts. The main goal of the YFX team, which consists of engineers who have years of experience working on trading systems and blockchain technology, is to build a DEX that can compete with CEXs on derivative trading.

The latest changes to the platform consist of the full rollout of a gift card feature and the integration of MoonPay, which has improved users’ capability of purchasing crypto with fiat-based bank cards.

After a trial run starting late last year, Freewallet has now fully launched a gift card feature aimed at making its users’ lives easier from an e-commerce perspective. With the new feature, users can now buy gift cards for online and brick-and-mortar businesses with any cryptocurrency supported by the platform. The process is simple and can be completed in just a few minutes.

To make the feature possible, Freewallet has partnered with over 800+ brands from around the world, including Amazon, eBay, iTunes and many more. The feature comes with a search tool that allows users to organize their options according to popularity or alphabetical order and includes offerings from a wide variety of stores covering a whole spectrum of consumer needs — including beauty and lifestyle, booksellers, department stores, electronics, entertainment, food and drink, home and DIY, jewelers, leisure and sports, men’s fashion, supermarkets, toys and games, travel and women’s fashion.

These gift cards make the perfect gift option for crypto enthusiasts looking to do something special for their friends and loved ones, and it’s even a great way to treat themselves without having to use fiat. Each gift card can range in value from $1–$1,000, depending on the user’s preference.

The gift card feature is just one of the recent changes to be introduced to the platform. Another significant development has been the integration of MoonPay, one of the industry’s premier fiat-to-crypto transaction facilitators. By bringing in MoonPay, Freewallet has enhanced its purchase-with-card function. Now users can use any of the 42 major fiat currencies supported by MoonPay to purchase Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Chiliz (CHZ), Litecoin (LTC), Stellar (XLM), USD Coin (USDC), EOS, Tron (TRX), NEO, Dai, VeChain (VET), Zilliqa (ZIL), TrueUSD (TUSD), 0x (ZRX), Paxos Standard Token (PAX), Decentraland (MANA), Civic (CVC), EOSDT and USDT20.

These changes are the result of the continuous dialogue between the Freewallet development team and its community. As the platform continues to grow, it has made it a priority to become an all-inclusive crypto hub for its users. Freewallet prides itself on pairing groundbreaking technology with intuitive simplicity.

Solomon Brown, head of PR at Freewallet, had this to say about the changes: “We are really pleased that we can introduce more useful features for our users. We have been quite lucky in that we have been able to gather a large community around our platform and listen to the feedback they provide us with. It is amazing to see both the strides that we have taken as a service and the progress being made in the industry as a whole. We hope that our users will enjoy the new gift card feature as well as the retooled exchange.”

Founded in 2017, the company has built its services around a network of distributed resources that own and profit off unused hardware. Cudos clients can, therefore, harness cloud computing resources securely and at a much lower price as opposed to centralized alternatives. On the other hand, hardware owners are incentivized to share their computing resources in order to provide end-customers with low-latency and cost-effective resources.

The company has since launched the Cudos Network, an exciting endeavor into the blockchain technology market. Aware that high-performance blockchains must access off-chain computing resources, the Cudos Network bridges the gap between cloud computing and blockchain ledgers in a decentralized, secure and incentivizing manner. Over the long term, this will foster innovation across the blockchain space, as project developers will build more performant blockchains that rely on layer-two computations for innovative use cases. The process has already started as Cudos has partnered up with numerous companies in the tech space, including AMD, PlayStation Partners, Verne Global, Outlier Ventures, Sapphire, NexGen Cloud and others.

Cudos token listing on KuCoin

This cloud computing framework is unified under a common standard via Cudos, a utility token that provides access to worthwhile revenue streams within the Cudos Network. After being oversubscribed in the presale and raising over $10 million, the project is now listing Cudos on KuCoin.

Once the listing is live, KuCoin traders will have the opportunity to access a staking mechanism designed to reward users who choose to lock up their tokens for a limited timeframe. It’s imperative to keep in mind that the Cudos Network has its own staking system, which is a prerequisite to becoming an incentivized validator node, earning up to 30% of their stake per annum. Rewards are also available via the delegated staking program, which distributes rewards to users who fail to accumulate the 2-million staking minimum. Cudos ownership is necessary to access cloud compute jobs, representing an all-around access ticket to the Cudos ecosystem.

Cudos value potential grows

Cudos isn’t only listed on KuCoin, however. In fact, the token was first listed as part of a primary listing event on BitMax, only to be later listed on Poloniex as well. Trade analysis shows impressive price gains following the initial listing, thereby highlighting Cudos’ potential as a rewarding utility token. To put this into perspective, the Cudos strategic funding phase debuted at $0.006 per token and managed to attain a $0.12 appreciation as soon as the token was listed on the public market, highlighting a 2,000% rise.

Now trading at an average of $0.07, Cudos is certainly generating considerable hype for cloud computing enthusiasts. As expected, Cudos’ initial investors have been greatly rewarded following the recent price increases, consolidating the idea that people believe in the project’s utility and value proposition for the blockchain market.

Exploring the Cudos tokenomics

The Cudos token is hard-capped at 10 billion coins, with most of the funds raised via the token sales destined to fund the platform’s development, marketing strategy, validator nodes and customer acquisition efforts.

In the foreseeable future, the Cudos token will find itself listed on a growing number of cryptocurrency exchanges, facilitating profit-seeking trades between compatible crypto pairs. At this time, the token is available for purchase and sale via the CUDOS/USDT pair. More trading pairs will be added in the near future.

The CUDOS/USDT trading pair will debut trading at 10:00 on Feb. 2, 2021.

Eleven of the 21 new entrants added to the annual tally are applying blockchain and DLT-based solutions to problems regarding supply chains, product tracking and shipping information.

According to Forbes, “hundreds of sizable companies are now using Bitcoin and its underlying technology to make their operations more efficient.”

“Most companies on the Blockchain 50, however, are not Bitcoin speculators but rather are looking to employ the technology underlying the cryptocurrency in innovative ways.”

Some of the bigger companies in this category include Boeing, which is using a blockchain-enabled air traffic control system for drones; Oracle, which operates a maritime shipping consortium with over 300 customers; and Coca Cola’s CONA Services, which tracks orders, shipments and invoices between bottlers using the blockchain.

French supermarket chain Carrefour is a new entrant and is currently tracking 30 product lines via its own food traceability blockchain. Another is Sappi, which is using the blockchain to increase the sustainability of global supply chains; specifically as they relate to natural materials and packaging.

The emergence of an enterprise-driven, global blockchain logistics market has inspired fierce competition among its vendors, and it is expected to be worth $765.5 million by 2025.

While previous iterations of blockchain tech may not have been quite ready to tackle business problems on a global level, commercially-geared blockchain and DLT platforms — such as Hyperledger, Azure and Corda — provide an exponentially higher amount of network throughput. This has resulted in their increasing employment by a number of large companies seeking blockchain-oriented solutions for logistical problems.

National governments have also started to apply the blockchain to areas of logistics. Last month, the United States military awarded a $1.5 million grant to SIMBA Chain, a smart contract platform to be used in making military supply chains more efficient. Also in January, the U.K. National Health Service took to the blockchain as a means of monitoring stores of COVID-19 vaccine.

Other major companies added to the list this year include Binance, for supporting over 100 blockchains on their exchange, MicroStrategy, for buying more than $1 billion in BTC during 2020, and Kakao, South Korea’s biggest messaging app, for developing its own cryptocurrency called “klay.”","['projects', 'additions', 'technology', 'underlying', 'supply', 'forbes', 'chain', 'companies', 'blockchain', '50', 'global', 'dominate', 'tracking', 'using', 'chains', 'added', 'logistics']","More than half of companies added to the Forbes Blockchain 50 list for the first time this year are using tblockchain to resolve logistical issues faced in their line of business.

A Feb. 3 tweet from MicroStrategy CEO, Michael Saylor, said that representatives of more than 1,400 firms have already signed up for the event — which is dubbed “Bitcoin for Corporations: Legal Considerations.”

If you are interested in the legal considerations firms face while integrating #Bitcoin into their corporate strategy, you are not alone. We have professionals from more than 1400 firms joining us tomorrow for this discussion. There is still time for your legal team to attend. https://t.co/fid9nrZUfP — Michael Saylor (@michael_saylor) February 2, 2021

The seminar will take place on Feb. 3 and Feb. 4, with five one-hour sessions scheduled for the first day, and twice as many 30-minute sessions slated for the second.

The first day will feature presentations from Saylor, the firm’s president and CFO Phong Le, along with representatives of legal firms specializing in digital assets. The topics discussed will include strategies for incorporating Bitcoin into treasury reserves and related questions regarding the accounting, tax, legal, and auditing considerations for firms who pursue this strategy.

The second day will feature presentations from top crypto exchanges and fund managers, including Coinbase, Binance, Grayscale, and Galaxy Digital.

In August, MicroStrategy made headlines after revealing it had purchased 21,000 BTC for $250 million. The following month, Saylor announced the firm had purchased an additional 16,796 Bitcoin for $175 million, with the firm continuously purchasing roughly 0.19 BTC every three seconds over 74 hours to complete the transaction.

In December, MicroStrategy issued $650 million worth of bonds which were quickly mobilized to purchase 29,646 BTC. The firm purchased an additional 314 Bitcoin for $10 million in late January, and a further 295 BTC for $10 million this week, bringing its Bitcoin reserves up to 71,079 BTC, or 0.38% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply.

While MicroStrategy paid $1.095 billion to accumulate its BTC holdings, current prices value the stash at $2.57 billion — a gain of 135%.

In an interview with Forbes, Mayor Francis Suarez said tangible paths to expand Bitcoin's adoption throughout the city included enabling city employee salaries to be paid in BTC.

Major figures in the cryptocurrency world have responded positively to the idea, with Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey calling it “smart” on Twitter.

Germini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss stated that the mayor is “leading the way for governments and Bitcoin.”

Mayor Suarez told Forbes that due to the rise in crypto’s popularity among citizens, he wants to do everything he can to make Miami a Bitcoin-friendly city. Other proposals include allowing local fees and taxes to be paid in Bitcoin and certain other cryptocurrencies, as well as investing some of the city’s treasury into Bitcoin, following Microstrategy’s example.

Although he isn’t sure of specific amounts, Suarez explained that the treasury investment would be structured as a public-private partnership, with the private partners receiving some of the rewards for alleviating some of the risks.

He also revealed that he’s also considering financing his reelection campaign in Bitcoin. He isn’t the first to turn to Bitcoin to help fund political campaigns with Democrat Andrew Yang, California U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell, Minnesota U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer, and Libertarian Lara Loomer among U.S. politicians who have already accepted cryptocurrencies in past campaigns.

The mayor believes Bitcoin will be the “biggest story for the next few years.”

Late last year the mayor called Bitcoin a “stable investment” during an “incredibly unstable year.” Last week, he uploaded Bitcoin’s whitepaper onto the government’s website saying:

“The City of Miami believes in Bitcoin and I’m working day and night to turn Miami into a hub for crypto innovation.”

The mayor told Forbes that he has reached out to other states and jurisdictions, including Caitlin Long in Wyoming and Florida CFO Jimmy Patronis to help drive Bitcoin-friendly changes in Florida’s legislature. These efforts are part of the city’s push to be the next major tech hub in the U.S. with plans to grow innovation and tech growth in the next few years.

Should these actions take effect, Miami’s 450,000 citizens may be encouraged to start transacting in Bitcoin on a regular basis, with the potential for this to spread to the rest of Florida’s 21.5 million residents. It would also make the city more attractive for blockchain-related tech companies and events.

Major crypto conference Bitcoin 2021 announced earlier today it was moving from Los Angeles to Miami in June this year.

Although Miami may be the first U.S. city to offer employees salaries in Bitcoin, other companies have also been exploring this. Last week, Cointelegraph reported that software development services provider Sequoia Holdings, based in Virginia, is offering employees the ability to sacrifice a portion of their salary to invest in either Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), or Ether (ETH).","['employees', 'bitcoin', 'forbes', 'miami', 'city', 'salaries', 'tech', 'paid', 'able', 'mayor', 'suarez']","Miami city employees could soon choose to get their salaries paid in Bitcoin rather than USD.

Multiple metrics like the increasing amount of Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) locked in DeFi, soaring transaction and on-chain activity and the plummeting BTC and Ether reserves of top exchanges show that investors are becoming increasingly interested in cryptocurrency.

Data from CryptoQuant, an on-chain analytics firm, shows that as Ether (ETH) established a new all-time high above $1,500 on Feb. 2, the amount of Ether held on all centralized exchange’s reserves continued to drop to new lows as token holders withdrew their coins.

Many analysts believe that the rapidly expanding DeFi sector, launch of Eth2 and increasing participation from institutional investors are the primary reasons for the drop in BTC and Ether held on centralized exchanges.

The rise of DeFi and yield farming

Each week the number of participants interacting with the DeFi sector seems to reach a new high and as of Feb. 2, the total value locked in DeFi platforms has reached $28.67 billion.

Data from Defi Pulse shows that the majority of DeFi platforms are built on the Ethereum network and require Ether to transact with the protocol.

In addition to offering attractive ways to earn a yield from simply lending Ether, an increasing amount of the available supply is being directed towards DeFi-related activities and not available for trading purposes.

A similar phenomenon is happening with BTC as holders looking to participate in the DeFi space without selling their Bitcoin have been wrapping them into ERC-20 synthetic versions of Ether.

Platforms like REN and BadgerDAO lead in this effort and a similar drain on the available Bitcoin supply could also be helping to push the price of BTC higher.

Eth2 and extended lock-up staking

Since the launch of the Beacon chain on Dec. 1, 2020, the Eth2 contract has enabled token holders to stake their Ether in the new PoS contract by becoming validators for the network.

Data from the Eth2 Launch Pad shows that there are currently 2,907,298 Ether worth a total of $4.39 billion staked on the network earning an estimated APR of 9.2%

The contract has a multi-year commitment but for holders who refuse to stomach the risk and volatility of DeFi yield farming, Eth2 staking offers a way to earn a yield over time rather than let tokens sit on exchanges or in cold wallets.

Institutional investors begin to see the value proposition of Ether

Since 2020, Bitcoin has received the lion’s share of attention from the institutional investment crowd as investors like MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor lead the way by buying up immense sums of Bitcoin and tweeting non-stop about its estimated future value.

Now that Bitcoin is more than a decade old and seen as more established, firms are increasingly open to looking for the next big opportunity that the cryptocurrency sector has to offer. With the explosion of DeFi and its current dependence on the Ethereum network, Ether is quickly becoming a recommended choice for the institutional investors.

Grayscale Investments temporarily closed their various crypto trusts to new investments in late December following the rise in the price of Bitcoin, but inflow resumed in early January and their total Ether holdings have increased by 242% over the past 3 months.

Coinbase also noted in its annual 2020 review that institutional investors are increasingly seeing Ether as a store of value with “a growing number” of its institutional clients taking a position in the token due to the strong returns offered.

The exchange also noted that while a majority of their clients bought BTC throughout 2020, Ether’s strong finish to the year saw it surpass BTC in terms of price growth and this is a trend which has continued into 2021.

Ark Invest’s latest report, ""Bitcoin: Preparing for Institutions,"" shows that even a paltry allocation of 1% by companies from the S&P 500 could boost Bitcoin’s price by $40,000. However, analysts at Ar believe that the allocation is likely to be in the range of 2.5% to 6.5%, which ""could impact bitcoin’s price by $200,000 to $500,000.""

Even as Bitcoin’s price consolidates and readies for the next leg up, several altcoins have been rising, backed by strong fundamentals and investors' high expectations of their upcoming products. Let’s look at three such tokens today.

BAND/USD

The decentralized finance space has boomed in the past few months, and the success of the protocols rely heavily upon data sources that are decentralized, fast and reliable. This is where Band Protocol steps in. The cross-chain data oracle has announced several partnerships in the past few days, which shows it is gradually building its market share.

The strong rally in stocks such as GameStop, AMC and others have captured traders' attention in the past few days. Band’s tie-up with Injective Protocol to deliver decentralized price oracles for various stocks to be supported on the decentralized derivatives platform could benefit the price of its native token, BAND, as a successful integration would be followed by an increase in demand.

Similarly, Linear Finance, a derivatives asset protocol, will also use Band’s real-time price feeds to offer its clients a seamless trading experience for several synthetic assets.

Band is not limited to only providing price feeds of cryptocurrencies, foreign exchange assets and commodities. Elrond and Band have expanded their partnership further to bridge the two networks to provide off-chain data to various applications being developed on the Elrond network. Other than the usual price feeds, Band will also cater to data requests for sports, gaming, esports and much more.

Along with these, Band has also entered into partnerships with the Moonbeam protocol, Nervos and Fantom in the past few days and broadened its existing partnership with CoinGecko.

BAND price rose from $7.1532 on Jan. 22 to $12.949 on Tuesday, an 81% rally within a short time. Previous to this move, the price had largely been stuck in the range of $7 to $11.50 for the past few days.

BAND/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The bulls pushed the price above the range on Tuesday, but the long wick on the day’s candlestick shows the bears are aggressively selling at higher levels. This has dragged the price back into the aforementioned trading range.

If the bulls do not give up much ground, then one more attempt to break above the range is likely. The 20-day exponential moving average ($9.28) has started to turn up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive territory, which suggests that the path of least resistance is to the upside.

If the bulls can drive and sustain the price above $11.50, the BAND/USD pair could rally to $16 and then to $17.78. This zone may act as stiff resistance, but if the bulls can propel the price above it, the momentum could further pick up.

Contrary to this assumption, if the bears successfully defend the $11.50–$12.949 resistance zone, the pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.

LRC/USD

The GameStop saga and the trading limits imposed on retail traders by brokerages like Robinhood have exposed their significant flaws. This is likely to draw traders to decentralized exchanges where control does not lie with any central entity.

Transaction fees are an extremely important aspect during trading, especially for smaller-sized traders. So, when Ethereum gas fees increase, these retail traders are the most affected. Loopring attempts to solve this problem with it layer-two scaling.

Data from Dune Analytics shows that Loopring’s fee collection recently surged to its highest-ever level due to increasing volume. The protocol recently updated its LRC tokenomics model and announced a new fee distribution pattern to its various participants. This could further attract LRC investors who may want to benefit from the rising popularity of the protocol.

LRC rose from an intraday low at $0.33651 on Jan. 22 to an intraday high at $0.57618 on Jan. 31, a 71% rally within a few days. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls are in control.

LRC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The up-move is currently facing resistance near $0.55, and the LRC/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($0.43). This is an important level to watch out for because the pair has taken support at the 20-day EMA on three previous occasions.

If the pair again rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $0.62167. If they succeed, the pair could rally to $0.71773 and then to $0.78.

This bullish view will invalidate if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that the bulls are not buying the dips anymore, and that could result in a fall to $0.35 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($0.31).

CREAM/USD

Certain aspects of traditional finance could act as an inspiration to build projects in the decentralized space. Cream Finance recently announced the launch of Iron Bank, which is guided by the success of the $10-trillion U.S. corporate debt market.

While there are several peer-to-peer lending protocols existing in the crypto space, Cream has taken it a step further and created a protocol-to-protocol lending mechanism. The main attraction of the Iron Bank is that it will facilitate zero-collateral lending.

To keep the risk under check, Cream will set a credit limit after whitelisting the protocols. Initially, the Iron Bank is available only for Cream’s partners, but if this project succeeds, it is likely to be a huge positive for the entire DeFi space.

In other news, Cream recently widened its services by adding SushiSwap and Uniswap LP tokens as collateral options for lending and borrowing.

The platform's CREAM token rallied from $119.35 on Jan. 22 to an intraday high at $319.9 on Tuesday, a 168% rally within a short time. The long wick on the day’s candlestick shows that traders aggressively booked profits at higher levels.

CREAM/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the bulls do not allow the price to dip below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $251.65, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. The upsloping 20-day EMA ($181) and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest the advantage to the bulls.

If the bulls can push and sustain the price above $294.80, the CREAM/USD pair could rally to $362 and then to $430.

Conversely, if the bears sink the price below $251.65, the pair could dip to the 61.8% retracement level at $209.45.

According to a report by the American political publication Politico, Tenev is expected to participate in a virtual hearing headed by Representative Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) on Feb. 18. Politico’s report cited anonymous people familiar with the matter.

Waters officially announced the Financial Services Committee’s plans to hold a GameStop-related hearing on Feb. 18. Entitled “Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide,” the hearing will focus on recent market volatility issues involving GameStop and other stocks.

“I am concerned about whether or not Robinhood restricted the trading because there was collusion between Robinhood and some of the hedge funds that were involved with this,” Waters reportedly said.

The announcement did not specify what witnesses will participate in the hearing. Robinhood has not officially announced Tenev’s participation so far. The firm did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.

As previously reported, some U.S. regulators have already drawn attention to Robinhood’s handling the GameStop short squeeze. On Jan. 29, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission hinted that it was looking at Robinhood’s issues with GameStop, expressing concern over “extreme price volatility of certain stocks’ trading prices.”

Robinhood’s GameStop saga started on Jan. 28 when the company suspended buying for GameStop stock and other shares that were allegedly pumped through the r/Wallstreetbets Reddit community. Robinhood subsequently restricted trading for as many as 50 stocks on Friday before narrowing the restrictions to eight stocks on Feb. 8. Still, Robinhood users are limited to just one GameStop share.

On Feb. 1, Robinhood’s Tenev discussed the firm’s move to restrict trading with Elon Musk on the audio chat app Clubhouse. Tenev reportedly said that the decision about restrictions was made by a clearinghouse and was based on the capital requirements. He also denied allegations that trading firm Citadel Securities — the largest market maker in options in the U.S. — had pushed the firm to impose the limits.","['feb', 'house', 'committee', 'tenev', 'gamestop', 'reportedly', 'robinhoods', 'firm', 'robinhood', 'trading', 'ceo', 'hearing', 'stocks', 'testify']","Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev will reportedly testify before the United States House Financial Services Committee over the firm’s role in the volatile trading of GameStop and other volatile stocks.

According to its website, Robinhood has lowered its list of restrictions to eight different stocks including GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, Express, Genius Brands International, Koss, Naked Brand Group and Nokia. Robinhood previously limited trading for as many as 50 stocks on Friday, CNBC reported.

As per the new restrictions, Robinhood users can still only buy one share of GameStop alongside five options contracts. AMC trading is capped at 10 shares and 10 options contracts.

Robinhood users who already hold a greater number of shares or contracts will have to sell their holdings in order to open more positions, the firm said:

“If you already hold a greater number of shares or contracts than the limits listed above, your positions will not be sold or closed. However, you will not be able to open more positions of each of these securities unless you sell enough of your holdings such that you are below the respective limit.”

Robinhood has been struggling to maintain its trading services while the r/Wallstreetbets Reddit community pumps stocks like GME to new all-time highs. On Thursday, Robinhood suspended GME purchases after the stock skyrocketed 1,400% from about $20 on Jan. 12. On Friday, the firm also temporarily disabled instant deposits for cryptocurrency purchases, citing “extraordinary market conditions.”

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission subsequently hinted that it was looking into the Robinhood platform, citing concerns over “extreme price volatility of certain stocks’ trading prices.”

Robinhood’s decision to halt GME trading was widely criticized in the trading community, with at least 100,000 negative reviews appearing on Robinhood’s page on the Google Play Store. Despite Google’s subsequent move to scrap thousands of negative reviews with its “fake review” tracking system, Robinhood app’s rating is still down to one star, with 294,954 reviews posted at publishing time.

Amid the ongoing issues, Robinhood users launched the “#robinhoodboycott” tag on Twitter, calling on traders to move their holdings off the platform. However, Robinhood is not the only company experiencing issues due to the GameStop short squeeze. On Saturday, online trading platform IG Group Holdings said that it will restrict any new positions on GME and AMC due to “extreme volatility” in the market.","['gme', 'holdings', 'positions', 'gamestop', 'platform', 'robinhood', 'users', 'limited', 'trading', 'shares', 'share', 'stocks']","Troubled trading app Robinhood has been narrowing the list of restricted stocks on its platform but is still keeping major restrictions on GameStop shares.

In his letter to employees, Bezos said that he would be transitioning to the role of executive chair of the Amazon board, where he would “focus my energies and attention on new products and early initiatives.” The transition is scheduled for later in the year.

Bezos also noted that Jassy “will be an outstanding leader, and has my full confidence.”

The crypto world’s attention now turns to Jassy’s history when it comes to embracing blockchain technology, as it could be an indication of the long-term crypto strategy of the world’s third-most valuable company by market capitalization.

Jassy offered a mixed review of blockchain technology and its applicability to Amazon's business in 2017. In a statement at the Amazon ""re:Invent"" conference, he expressed doubt that blockchain could be used for more than a “distributed ledger” but also said he and his team were personally interested. However, company policy dictated that they don't “build technology [just] because we think it is cool.”

He did leave the door open for future exploration, however, saying, “We are very intrigued by what customers are ultimately going to do there.”

In 2018, Jassy did move forward with a “quasi-blockchain” offering, as he oversaw the launch of two blockchain products: Amazon Quantum Ledger Database and Amazon Managed Blockchain. As Cointelegraph reported, the products maintained centralized databases but included cryptographic qualities.

Aside from these forays, Amazon has largely only made crypto headlines as a scapegoat: In November 2020, Coinbase blamed an AWS outage for one of its frequent service interruptions.

“Buy crypto” searches on Google surged to all-time highs in January, far exceeding the previous peak of early 2018, according to cryptocurrency analytics company The Tie.

Relative search interest for the term ""Buy Crypto"" is at all-time high on Google Trends pic.twitter.com/4cFIkI0xbp — The TIE (@TheTIEIO) February 1, 2021

The keyword received a perfect Google Trends score of 100, which indicates maximum relative interest.

A similar spike was also observed for Ethereum, which achieved a perfect score of 100 before falling back down to a still-strong 65.

Bitcoin (BTC) searches also spiked, but remain well below the 2017 bull market high.

The Tie also shared the following chart with Cointelegraph, which highlights a sharp rise in searches for “best crypto app” and “best crypto exchange.”

“Relative search interest for popular crypto terms is at an all-time high on Google Trends,” Treyce Dahlem, research analyst at The Tie, to Cointelegraph.

He continued:

“Whether this is due to the recent price rallies that we’ve seen, speculative traders from Reddit looking to leave their mark on more assets, or even a macro shift in the way investors are searching for a hedge against inflation, one thing is clear: There is a rapidly growing interest in crypto and new investors are looking for the best way to get into the ecosystem.”

The explosive search trends seem to coincide with growing retail interest in both Ethereum and altcoins. Ether’s (ETH) price has doubled since the start of the year, having just reached a new all-time high above $1,500.

Meanwhile, the overall cryptocurrency market in January reached $1 trillion for the first time. While the initial spike was largely due to Bitcoin, altcoins have supported the trillion-dollar valuation with greater intensity over the past month. In the process, Bitcoin’s dominance rate has fallen to 62% from a high of 72% in early January.

Google search trends are sometimes correlated with movements in the overall cryptocurrency market. Higher relative searches signal growing retail awareness of digital assets, which is often a precursor to wider speculative adoption.

The Tie revealed to Cointelegraph that social media engagement surrounding crypto has also skyrocketed. On Twitter, aggregate tweet volumes devoted to cryptocurrency reached 3.3 million in January, up from 1.3 million in September 2020. January’s aggregate tweet volume was 181% higher than a year earlier.","['alltime', 'buy', 'hit', 'high', 'interest', 'search', 'record', 'tie', 'crypto', 'trends', 'searches', 'cryptocurrency', 'google']","If Google search trends are anything to go by, crypto euphoria appears to be on the rise again, according to new industry research.

According to an announcement from Cash App, its clearing broker, Axos, halted the app’s ability to complete purchases of stocks for GameStop, AMC Entertainment, Nokia and Koss Corporation — at least four of the stocks pushed by retail investors on the r/Wallstreetbets subreddit in their fight against hedge funds’ shorts. However, the app later tweeted that the broker has restored trading for AMC and Nokia.

Cash App initially said that it “wholeheartedly” disagreed with Axos’ actions and added that it would attempt to allow users to purchase all the affected stocks “as soon as possible.” The platform has not mentioned any change in the status of trading GameStop and Koss Corporation stocks, but the price of GME fell under $100 for the first time in a week, reaching $99.50 at the time of publication.

Though it appeared that Cash App was trying to distance itself from any possible allegations of market manipulation in the wake of the GameStop short sells, the restrictions on buys were similar to those imposed by other trading apps last week.

Robinhood announced on Thursday that it had suspended buying for GameStop stock and others after many of the stocks surged. The trading app has since lowered these restrictions, but its users are still limited to buying one GME share as of yesterday.

The excitement surrounding this project has electrified several major Chinese cities, as well as onlookers throughout the world.

Most recently, Shenzhen launched its “iShenzhen” lottery, wherein the city government will distribute 20 million digital yuan among 100,000 central bank digital currency, or CBDC, wallet holders. This comes on the back of a similar lottery held in the city of Suzhou, one of China’s major “special economic zones.” Suzhou has already engaged with several blockchain projects in an effort to deepen the municipality’s understanding and use of decentralized technology, smart contracts and the general learning curve the local population may face.

Related: China turns up pace on CBDC release, tests infrastructure prior to adoption

As China continues to cement itself in the international economy, it is proving to be a leader in the race toward CBDC adoption, an initiative that would make Chinese goods and services more accessible within the global marketplace. Many experts in the fields of fiscal policy and financial technology have argued that the digitization of public money is an inevitable consequence of distributed ledger technology.

The particular political and economic ramifications of this switch to digital currency will depend on the specific decisions of governments regarding their approaches to these new technologies. China, for example, has adopted an approach that has seen repeated success throughout contemporary business culture.

A number of other nations, with economies of all sizes, are more or less waiting in the wings as the People’s Bank of China demonstrates its leadership. In the Suzhou and Shenzhen experiments, citizens are allotted digital yuan and encouraged to link their digital wallets to their existing PBoC accounts, and if they do not use the digital currency within a few weeks, it disappears.

Nations are especially eager to see how this program unfolds and how adoption looks at the grassroots level. Businesses and governments have a natural incentive to embrace this technology, as it reduces overhead and friction, which enhances their bottom line. However, for citizens whose motives might not be tied to financial gain, which other incentives will prompt them to start using an entirely different system of money and banking? These aforementioned adoption trends will be a key driver that determines how quickly other nations will begin developing their own CBDCs.

Related: Did CBDCs affect the crypto space in 2020, and what’s next in 2021? Experts answer

Smaller nations have a better chance for quicker launches

This experiment has excited economic participation within China and roused interest from public banks across the world. Which countries have positioned themselves to follow China into the digital future? Certainly, China’s influence, as well as a long-standing pro-technology culture throughout the continent, suggests that many East Asian countries may follow suit. The Bank of Thailand launched a CBDC pilot program back in June 2020. Moreover, just last fall, the Bank of Korea announced plans for a 2021 CBDC issuance, while Japanese banking officials have articulated a more cautious, passive course of interest following China’s CBDC.

Smaller nations, of course, have a different set of obstacles in their financial experimentation. Recently, the Bahamas introduced its “Sand Dollar” and Cambodia its “Bakong,” following China’s example. This is made possible, however, by the smaller size of these national banking systems that allow them to move with greater agility as well as a degree of autonomy. This becomes an advantage for smaller nations, as the global dependence on their currency is also smaller, so the interoperability issues are of a lesser priority than for global economies like the United States and China where it becomes a highly critical aspect.

However, larger nations are also showing greater interest. A year-long research report published recently by the central banks of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates shows that the early adoption of digital currencies is favorable — particularly for major economies that have operated with relatively higher degrees of autonomy, unlike those in the eurozone or a part of the North American Free Trade Association, for example. Like China, the Saudi and Emirati governments, given their manufacturing and natural resources, do not accrue as much debt as is standard in other major economies in the West.

This brings to light an interesting aspect of CBDC adoption, one that may influence the process of digitization across the world’s public banks. While a huge number of factors determine how and when a particular economy may adopt digital currency — such as its size, the preexisting economic landscape, its gross domestic product, etc. — an important aspect seems to be a strong national (as opposed to global) economic program. This is interesting not only because it flags particular nations as being predisposed to CBDCs but also because it highlights the importance of interoperability after a currency has been instituted. These digitization programs, in other words, will be brought about through strong national economic policy control, but in order to uphold the global systems that we live in, these technologies will need to interact through intermediary programs.

Interoperability is highly critical for major economies

With a push to all the global CBDC initiatives, the Bank of International Settlements’ Innovation Hub, or BISIH, announced that CBDC research is a top priority for it in 2021. It plans to gauge the feasibility of faster, cheaper cross-border payments. This initiative is going to be highly beneficial for global economies exploring the interoperability of their own CBDC projects using BISIH research and pilot tests to facilitate their own CBDC program and by working with them for all settlements and cross-border payment concerns.

While focusing on domestic use cases is understandable for individual countries, CBDCs will only ever operate in local sandboxes unless there is some type of interoperable protocol. It is critical to bridge the gaps between the various CBDC initiatives and existing payments systems as well as other digital currencies to ensure their success on a global scale.

While governments exploring the use of CBDCs is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, truly borderless, global commerce will be powered with the help of an interoperable protocol, as our economic system is too multifaceted to be replaced by a singular currency.

The move marks a major step for the fledgling DeFi sector and more fixed-rate lending protocols in DeFi may attract additional users seeking mostability in longer-term investments and loans, such as mortgages. Currently, the ecosystem is largely populated by yield farmers looking for quick gains on their crypto collateral.

The DeFi engineer attempted the process through TradFi by seeking an offset loan, which directs a savings account’s interest towards paying down a mortgage.

Speaking to The Defiant, however, the borrower stated that banks are very cautious about lending in times of economic uncertainty, especially to those that are self-employed. He added that he had been rejected for a basic credit card for four years.

Notional Finance provides fixed-rate loans for up to six months for users that deposit crypto collateral in wrapped BTC, ETH, wrapped ETH, or DAI.

The approach was far from simple and user-friendly for noobs, however. The engineer had to pay off his bank loan first in AUD. He then had to borrow the USD pegged stablecoin USDC from Notional at a fixed rate, providing his own liquidity to avoid the slippage and fees on the new low volume platform.

He then added around $1 million in wBTC and wETH as collateral to Notional against which he borrowed around $500,000 of USDC which was converted to AUD to pay off the bank. He said:

“I feel like I’m in full control of my situation. People should be all over this stuff.”

Borrowing rates on Notional Finance for USDC are approximately 6% but some of that can be recouped by earnings from liquidity provision. There is the added bonus of maintaining a position in a bull market without having to sell crypto assets and incur a capital gains event upon which there would have been taxes to pay.

He added that the process was fast compared to traditional finance;

“It felt like it would’ve taken months of applications, finding tax returns and bank statements for the bank to refinance me, but I was able to do it all in one day, under my own agency,”

Leading DeFi protocol Aave has also started down the mortgage path with its latest partnership. In an announcement on Feb. 2, Aave stated that the scheme was in collaboration with RealT, a firm that tokenizes real estate in order to allow users to stake their property as collateral to take out loans. The ability to use these assets as collateral is the first step in making “mortgage” loans on Ethereum available to a wider audience.","['bank', 'users', 'defi', 'notional', 'aussie', 'refinances', 'day', 'collateral', 'added', 'loans', 'usdc', 'single', 'mortgage', 'loan', 'engineer', 'pioneering', 'using']","The move marks a major step for the fledgling DeFi sector and more fixed-rate lending protocols in DeFi may attract additional users seeking mostability in longer-term investments and loans, such as mortgages.

“What’s great about Terra is they are one of the first sandbox experiments that’s getting outside the sandbox […] We are always looking at those projects because they are the canaries in the coal mines of what else is going to happen.”

Nic Carter, a former Fidelity crypto asset analyst and Castle Island Ventures partner, slammed the Wall Street Journal article titled “Behind the Bitcoin Bubble” by Andy Kessler, alleging that it verged on “journalistic malpractice”.

“Normally, if you are a columnist writing in one of the most respected financial publications, you might try and evaluate the data behind that claim, instead of just uncritically accepting it. But Mr. Kessler did no such thing. He just blindly repeated a fanciful claim from an anonymous blogger in order to imply that Bitcoin’s price was somehow dependent on Tether.”

The award-winning WSJ writer based some of his fairly extensive criticism on the work of a blogger called “CryptoAnon” in a viral post called “The Bit Short: Inside Crypto’s Doomsday Machine”. Kessler wrote the blogger had ""found that as much as two-thirds of Bitcoin buys on any given day were purchased with Tether"" based on CoinLib data.

Raising questions over Tether and its lack of audits and the idea USDT was being employed to buy Bitcoin to ""jack up its price,"" Kessler added;

“Normally I wouldn’t care. Bitcoin is nothing, it’s vapor, a concept of an idea. Transactions using Bitcoin are few and far between. It’s not a store of value—anything that drops 30% in a week can’t play that role.”

Kessler said he must also note that ""wallet provider Coinbase, the largest holder of Bitcoin, says it 'does not support USDT.' Do they know something? (Coinbase offers its own stablecoin USDC, in partnership with Circle.)

Carter, who is now board chair at Coin Metrics, wrote that assessing trade between USDT and Bitcoin using data called CoinLib was “indefensible” as it included tens of billions of wash trading data from exchanges that reputable data sources ignore.

He said any serious trader knows that “many of the exchanges composing the CoinLib sample are not credible, and that the resultant data was thus completely unreliable.”

“As I will demonstrate, this data is not sufficient to make the case that Bitcoin liquidity is dominated by Tether, and relying on it is liable to mislead. Unfortunately, the mainstream financial press is now amplifying these erroneous claims.”

Carter stated that CoinLib is taking the data outputs from marginal and often non-fiat connected Tether based exchanges as face value, and “unsophisticated analysts like CryptoAnon” are using it to disseminate FUD about Bitcoin’s liquidity.

He argued that highly regulated exchanges and institutional fund providers do not rely on or even support Tether in some cases and they all facilitate an on-ramp to Bitcoin and support the price.

“Other entities like Cash App, Paxos, Paypal, BlockFi, Robinhood, Bitwise, and Grayscale all facilitate various forms of exposure to Bitcoin and are connected to the commercial bank system and in some cases publicly-traded companies. No Tether present.”

Carter concludes that Kessler needs more research and called for a retraction and a correction by the WSJ:

“Wild theories relying on data that everyone in the crypto industry knows to be erroneous do no one any good.”","['support', 'metrics', 'fud', 'aim', 'called', 'kessler', 'usdt', 'coinlib', 'cofounder', 'bitcoin', 'takes', 'data', 'coin', 'wsjs', 'exchanges', 'tether', 'using']","The co-founder of crypto data and insights firm Coin Metrics has fired back at yet another article in mainstream media claiming that the “Bitcoin bubble” has been driven by Tether.

According to Fox Business Network’s Charles Gasparino, sources inside Robinhood say the company’s only focus is surviving the fallout from the drama it currently finds itself engulfed in, and will pause its plans for an IPO launch for now.

Execs say they have access to even more capital than additional amounts raised today. More @TeamCavuto 1230pm — Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) February 1, 2021

As reported by Techcrunch, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev was quizzed by none other than Elon Musk on invite-only app Clubhouse, where Tenev revealed the extent of the firm’s losses.

According to Tenev, he woke up early on Jan. 28 to find a bill from the National Securities Clearing Corporation for the sum of $3 billion, payable immediately. Providing context for that number, Tenev said:

“Robinhood up until that point has raised around $2 billion in total venture capital. Up until now, so it’s a big number, like $3 billion is a large number, right.”

The Wall Street Journal reported on Feb. 1 that Robinhood had raised another $2.4 billion from investors, taking the total sum of money raised since last Thursday to $3.4 billion. Yet despite apparently having no problems with liquidity, the firm appears to have reasoned that its current public perception would not be conducive to a successful IPO.

Indeed, a vast majority of surveyed professionals believe that Robinhood has ruined its chances of launching an IPO due to its behavior during the recent GameStop saga.

An anonymous survey conducted via the Blind networking forum asked 8,750 verified professionals from major tech and financial services companies if they thought Robinhood had “screwed its IPO”. The results revealed that 83% thought the firm’s chances of a successful initial public offering had been irreparably damaged.

The response given by 37 Robinhood employees surveyed was markedly different. Just 13.5% believe the company has killed the possibility of ever seeing a successful IPO launch, while 86.5% believe it can still go ahead.

A self-effacing comment from a Facebook employee expressed the view that the IPO could still go ahead, but that Robinhood would forever suffer the same negative public opinion as the ubiquitous social media giant. They wrote:

“Robinhood is the next Facebook. Something tons of people will use but has a negative undertone and brand.”

Public opinion soured on Robinhood following the company’s decision to ban retail buy orders in the middle of the Reddit-inspired “short squeeze” on GameStop. Sharp-eyed observers were quick to point out the possible conflict of interest at play given 35% of Robinhood’s revenue came from the same firm which suffered heavy losses at the hands of r/Wallstreetbets organized band of collective traders.

Robinhood has since stated that the only reason it halted retail buy orders was because it couldn’t cover its commitments to the NSCC, which demands that each day’s trading liabilities are covered in full.

The company was contacted for comment, but had not replied by time of publication.","['ipo', 'billion', 'gamestop', 'wake', 'shelves', 'pr', 'raised', 'trading', 'disaster', 'reportedly', 'public', 'robinhood', 'opinion', 'tenev', 'successful', 'plans']","Trading app Robinhood may have put its plans for an initial public offering on hold after public opinion turned against the company in the wake of its response to the short squeeze on GameStop (GME).

XRP’s legal woes may place a damper on the rally

In the past few months, XRP price has been hard hit due to a lawsuit filed against Ripple by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC alleges that the company is conducting an ongoing illegal securities offering as Ripple still periodically sells XRP tokens out of the treasury.

Ripple recently filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the SEC seeking documents pertaining to Ethereum co-founders.

For the influencers and Wall Street Bets refugees who joined in on the rise — many of whom were taking their first ride on what’s known to be a notoriously volatile chart — the price action reversal has been especially harrowing.

Doge doing what it does best, welcoming people into crypto with a huge slap in the face. https://t.co/0GpiKe4B8U — RyanJK (@RJ_Kunz) January 30, 2021

Just yesterday, Dogecoin made history for cracking the top 10 cryptoassets by marketcap for the first time since 2015. The currency named after a dog meme that was started as a joke was propelled to such lofty heights on the back of similarly record-breaking social media volume, according to analytics provided by The TIE.

While some tied the rapid price appreciation to Elon Musk memes and the inevitable groupthink of crypto’s often momentum-based markets, $DOGE’s success may also be rooted in anti-establishment sentiments running rife through the retail crowd following popular trading app Robinhood disabling ‘Buy’ orders for certain assets.

The move from Robinhood and other brokers prompted furious accusations of hypocrisy and speculation that hedge funds were being favored over smaller investors — and what's a better way to highlight a broken system than pumping a joke coin to a multi-billion dollar valuation?

However, after reports of withdrawal issues on multiple centralized exchanges, Dogecoin has undergone a violent overnight reversal, leading many buyers to take to social media to express their regret. Just a few hours after posting that she’d “finally caved and bought the dog stock,” podcast host and media personality Mia Khalifa indicated some buyer’s remorse:

However, the new coin appears to be the latest in a series of jokes played by the CoinMarketCap team. The coin’s page on CMC features the following message:

The reference to Charmander-marth links to a YouTube video featuring Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya being interviewed by CNBC regarding his successful trading of GameStop stocks during the short-squeeze initiated by the r/Wallstreetbets subreddit.

The coin’s CMC page offers up a brief timeline of the GameStop saga, describing the short-squeeze tactic and the subsequent effect it had on the Robinhood trading app, which suspended retail trading for GameStop and several other stocks, including AMC, Nokia and Blackberry.

Once the massive pump lost momentum and traders quickly took profits, it seemed that investors would move on past the meme-based cryptocurrency and find something else to invest in.

The pump initially started when exchanges prevented retail traders from buying more GameStop and AMC stock on Jan. 28. Fueled by the Reddit discussion group r/Wallstreetbets, the army of investors turned their attention to silver and a selection of ‘cheap’ cryptocurrenceis.

On Jan.28, Twitter user ""WSB Chairman"" asked, ""Has Doge ever been to a dollar?"" to his 750,000 followers. That was enough to trigger the monster rally, despite Dogecoin having no protocol upgrades or developments since 2015.

The 68% retracement that followed the peak at $0.087 resembled Bitcoin's (BTC) sharp drop after the December 2017 crash, except this time around, instead of 50 days, it took only 24 hours.

Multiple social media influencers and streamers expressed their discontent at buying the top, an indication that the momentary speculative frenzy had passed. After spending most of Jan. 30 and Jan. 31 hovering around $0.03, DOGE managed to produce another 80% pump in less than three hours.

It's almost impossible to find the exact trigger for those events, as there are multiple social networks, including private Telegram groups and trading signal apps.

Reddit's r/SatoshiStreetBets currently has 213,000 active users and following DOGE’s breakout a meme-post by user Woke_AF_Populist quickly climbed to its most upvoted list.

There seems to be endless support from the Dogecoin fanbase, including Tesla's CEO and founder Elon Musk.

The most-traded Bitcoin product in centralized exchanges is Bitcoin futures, which is 10 times bigger than spot trading in terms of the trading volume. But on DEXs, spot trading platforms, such as Uniswap, occupy a large portion of the total trading volume, and there is not a single decentralized futures trading platform that could reach even one-10th of Uniswap’s trading volume. What stops decentralized futures trading platforms from becoming 10 times bigger than Uniswap? Why are decentralized futures trading platforms performing worse than their centralized counterparts?

The main reason is that decentralized futures exchanges don’t currently provide an attractive futures product to compete with centralized futures exchanges. For instance, centralized futures exchanges, such as BitMEX, can provide 100 times leverage on Bitcoin futures trading. On the other hand, decentralized futures exchanges, such as dYdX, only offer 10 times leverage. None of the decentralized exchanges can keep up with the 100x leverage offering from centralized exchanges.

YFX Descartes V1 uses QIC-AMM and a system de-risk mechanism to migrate perpetual futures trading from CEXs to DEXs without reducing the trading leverage, which makes YFX the first DEX that could offer 100x leverage on a perpetual contract. You can do everything on YFX you normally do on BitMEX or OKEx. YFX is poised to compete directly against established centralized exchanges. YFX Descartes V1 runs on both Huobi Heco Chain and Tron for faster transaction times and cheaper gas fees compared to Ethereum. The YFX team is also working on Ethereum’s layer-two solution to provide pragmatic perpetual trading on DEXs. The YFX team plans to launch its DEX on the Ethereum testnet in Q1, 2021.

About YFX

YFX is the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts. YFX Descartes V1 launched on both Huobi Heco Chain and Tron, and all trades are held and processed by smart contracts. The main goal of the YFX team, which consists of engineers who have years of experience working on trading systems and blockchain technology, is to build a DEX that can compete with CEXs on derivative trading.

The latest changes to the platform consist of the full rollout of a gift card feature and the integration of MoonPay, which has improved users’ capability of purchasing crypto with fiat-based bank cards.

After a trial run starting late last year, Freewallet has now fully launched a gift card feature aimed at making its users’ lives easier from an e-commerce perspective. With the new feature, users can now buy gift cards for online and brick-and-mortar businesses with any cryptocurrency supported by the platform. The process is simple and can be completed in just a few minutes.

To make the feature possible, Freewallet has partnered with over 800+ brands from around the world, including Amazon, eBay, iTunes and many more. The feature comes with a search tool that allows users to organize their options according to popularity or alphabetical order and includes offerings from a wide variety of stores covering a whole spectrum of consumer needs — including beauty and lifestyle, booksellers, department stores, electronics, entertainment, food and drink, home and DIY, jewelers, leisure and sports, men’s fashion, supermarkets, toys and games, travel and women’s fashion.

These gift cards make the perfect gift option for crypto enthusiasts looking to do something special for their friends and loved ones, and it’s even a great way to treat themselves without having to use fiat. Each gift card can range in value from $1–$1,000, depending on the user’s preference.

The gift card feature is just one of the recent changes to be introduced to the platform. Another significant development has been the integration of MoonPay, one of the industry’s premier fiat-to-crypto transaction facilitators. By bringing in MoonPay, Freewallet has enhanced its purchase-with-card function. Now users can use any of the 42 major fiat currencies supported by MoonPay to purchase Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Chiliz (CHZ), Litecoin (LTC), Stellar (XLM), USD Coin (USDC), EOS, Tron (TRX), NEO, Dai, VeChain (VET), Zilliqa (ZIL), TrueUSD (TUSD), 0x (ZRX), Paxos Standard Token (PAX), Decentraland (MANA), Civic (CVC), EOSDT and USDT20.

These changes are the result of the continuous dialogue between the Freewallet development team and its community. As the platform continues to grow, it has made it a priority to become an all-inclusive crypto hub for its users. Freewallet prides itself on pairing groundbreaking technology with intuitive simplicity.

Solomon Brown, head of PR at Freewallet, had this to say about the changes: “We are really pleased that we can introduce more useful features for our users. We have been quite lucky in that we have been able to gather a large community around our platform and listen to the feedback they provide us with. It is amazing to see both the strides that we have taken as a service and the progress being made in the industry as a whole. We hope that our users will enjoy the new gift card feature as well as the retooled exchange.”

Founded in 2017, the company has built its services around a network of distributed resources that own and profit off unused hardware. Cudos clients can, therefore, harness cloud computing resources securely and at a much lower price as opposed to centralized alternatives. On the other hand, hardware owners are incentivized to share their computing resources in order to provide end-customers with low-latency and cost-effective resources.

The company has since launched the Cudos Network, an exciting endeavor into the blockchain technology market. Aware that high-performance blockchains must access off-chain computing resources, the Cudos Network bridges the gap between cloud computing and blockchain ledgers in a decentralized, secure and incentivizing manner. Over the long term, this will foster innovation across the blockchain space, as project developers will build more performant blockchains that rely on layer-two computations for innovative use cases. The process has already started as Cudos has partnered up with numerous companies in the tech space, including AMD, PlayStation Partners, Verne Global, Outlier Ventures, Sapphire, NexGen Cloud and others.

Cudos token listing on KuCoin

This cloud computing framework is unified under a common standard via Cudos, a utility token that provides access to worthwhile revenue streams within the Cudos Network. After being oversubscribed in the presale and raising over $10 million, the project is now listing Cudos on KuCoin.

Once the listing is live, KuCoin traders will have the opportunity to access a staking mechanism designed to reward users who choose to lock up their tokens for a limited timeframe. It’s imperative to keep in mind that the Cudos Network has its own staking system, which is a prerequisite to becoming an incentivized validator node, earning up to 30% of their stake per annum. Rewards are also available via the delegated staking program, which distributes rewards to users who fail to accumulate the 2-million staking minimum. Cudos ownership is necessary to access cloud compute jobs, representing an all-around access ticket to the Cudos ecosystem.

Cudos value potential grows

Cudos isn’t only listed on KuCoin, however. In fact, the token was first listed as part of a primary listing event on BitMax, only to be later listed on Poloniex as well. Trade analysis shows impressive price gains following the initial listing, thereby highlighting Cudos’ potential as a rewarding utility token. To put this into perspective, the Cudos strategic funding phase debuted at $0.006 per token and managed to attain a $0.12 appreciation as soon as the token was listed on the public market, highlighting a 2,000% rise.

Now trading at an average of $0.07, Cudos is certainly generating considerable hype for cloud computing enthusiasts. As expected, Cudos’ initial investors have been greatly rewarded following the recent price increases, consolidating the idea that people believe in the project’s utility and value proposition for the blockchain market.

Exploring the Cudos tokenomics

The Cudos token is hard-capped at 10 billion coins, with most of the funds raised via the token sales destined to fund the platform’s development, marketing strategy, validator nodes and customer acquisition efforts.

In the foreseeable future, the Cudos token will find itself listed on a growing number of cryptocurrency exchanges, facilitating profit-seeking trades between compatible crypto pairs. At this time, the token is available for purchase and sale via the CUDOS/USDT pair. More trading pairs will be added in the near future.

The CUDOS/USDT trading pair will debut trading at 10:00 on Feb. 2, 2021.

Eleven of the 21 new entrants added to the annual tally are applying blockchain and DLT-based solutions to problems regarding supply chains, product tracking and shipping information.

According to Forbes, “hundreds of sizable companies are now using Bitcoin and its underlying technology to make their operations more efficient.”

“Most companies on the Blockchain 50, however, are not Bitcoin speculators but rather are looking to employ the technology underlying the cryptocurrency in innovative ways.”

Some of the bigger companies in this category include Boeing, which is using a blockchain-enabled air traffic control system for drones; Oracle, which operates a maritime shipping consortium with over 300 customers; and Coca Cola’s CONA Services, which tracks orders, shipments and invoices between bottlers using the blockchain.

French supermarket chain Carrefour is a new entrant and is currently tracking 30 product lines via its own food traceability blockchain. Another is Sappi, which is using the blockchain to increase the sustainability of global supply chains; specifically as they relate to natural materials and packaging.

The emergence of an enterprise-driven, global blockchain logistics market has inspired fierce competition among its vendors, and it is expected to be worth $765.5 million by 2025.

While previous iterations of blockchain tech may not have been quite ready to tackle business problems on a global level, commercially-geared blockchain and DLT platforms — such as Hyperledger, Azure and Corda — provide an exponentially higher amount of network throughput. This has resulted in their increasing employment by a number of large companies seeking blockchain-oriented solutions for logistical problems.

National governments have also started to apply the blockchain to areas of logistics. Last month, the United States military awarded a $1.5 million grant to SIMBA Chain, a smart contract platform to be used in making military supply chains more efficient. Also in January, the U.K. National Health Service took to the blockchain as a means of monitoring stores of COVID-19 vaccine.

Other major companies added to the list this year include Binance, for supporting over 100 blockchains on their exchange, MicroStrategy, for buying more than $1 billion in BTC during 2020, and Kakao, South Korea’s biggest messaging app, for developing its own cryptocurrency called “klay.”","['chains', '50', 'technology', 'additions', 'forbes', 'underlying', 'global', 'projects', 'added', 'dominate', 'logistics', 'supply', 'companies', 'tracking', 'using', 'chain', 'blockchain']","More than half of companies added to the Forbes Blockchain 50 list for the first time this year are using tblockchain to resolve logistical issues faced in their line of business.

A Feb. 3 tweet from MicroStrategy CEO, Michael Saylor, said that representatives of more than 1,400 firms have already signed up for the event — which is dubbed “Bitcoin for Corporations: Legal Considerations.”

If you are interested in the legal considerations firms face while integrating #Bitcoin into their corporate strategy, you are not alone. We have professionals from more than 1400 firms joining us tomorrow for this discussion. There is still time for your legal team to attend. https://t.co/fid9nrZUfP — Michael Saylor (@michael_saylor) February 2, 2021

The seminar will take place on Feb. 3 and Feb. 4, with five one-hour sessions scheduled for the first day, and twice as many 30-minute sessions slated for the second.

The first day will feature presentations from Saylor, the firm’s president and CFO Phong Le, along with representatives of legal firms specializing in digital assets. The topics discussed will include strategies for incorporating Bitcoin into treasury reserves and related questions regarding the accounting, tax, legal, and auditing considerations for firms who pursue this strategy.

The second day will feature presentations from top crypto exchanges and fund managers, including Coinbase, Binance, Grayscale, and Galaxy Digital.

In August, MicroStrategy made headlines after revealing it had purchased 21,000 BTC for $250 million. The following month, Saylor announced the firm had purchased an additional 16,796 Bitcoin for $175 million, with the firm continuously purchasing roughly 0.19 BTC every three seconds over 74 hours to complete the transaction.

In December, MicroStrategy issued $650 million worth of bonds which were quickly mobilized to purchase 29,646 BTC. The firm purchased an additional 314 Bitcoin for $10 million in late January, and a further 295 BTC for $10 million this week, bringing its Bitcoin reserves up to 71,079 BTC, or 0.38% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply.

While MicroStrategy paid $1.095 billion to accumulate its BTC holdings, current prices value the stash at $2.57 billion — a gain of 135%.

In an interview with Forbes, Mayor Francis Suarez said tangible paths to expand Bitcoin's adoption throughout the city included enabling city employee salaries to be paid in BTC.

Major figures in the cryptocurrency world have responded positively to the idea, with Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey calling it “smart” on Twitter.

Germini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss stated that the mayor is “leading the way for governments and Bitcoin.”

Mayor Suarez told Forbes that due to the rise in crypto’s popularity among citizens, he wants to do everything he can to make Miami a Bitcoin-friendly city. Other proposals include allowing local fees and taxes to be paid in Bitcoin and certain other cryptocurrencies, as well as investing some of the city’s treasury into Bitcoin, following Microstrategy’s example.

Although he isn’t sure of specific amounts, Suarez explained that the treasury investment would be structured as a public-private partnership, with the private partners receiving some of the rewards for alleviating some of the risks.

He also revealed that he’s also considering financing his reelection campaign in Bitcoin. He isn’t the first to turn to Bitcoin to help fund political campaigns with Democrat Andrew Yang, California U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell, Minnesota U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer, and Libertarian Lara Loomer among U.S. politicians who have already accepted cryptocurrencies in past campaigns.

The mayor believes Bitcoin will be the “biggest story for the next few years.”

Late last year the mayor called Bitcoin a “stable investment” during an “incredibly unstable year.” Last week, he uploaded Bitcoin’s whitepaper onto the government’s website saying:

“The City of Miami believes in Bitcoin and I’m working day and night to turn Miami into a hub for crypto innovation.”

The mayor told Forbes that he has reached out to other states and jurisdictions, including Caitlin Long in Wyoming and Florida CFO Jimmy Patronis to help drive Bitcoin-friendly changes in Florida’s legislature. These efforts are part of the city’s push to be the next major tech hub in the U.S. with plans to grow innovation and tech growth in the next few years.

Should these actions take effect, Miami’s 450,000 citizens may be encouraged to start transacting in Bitcoin on a regular basis, with the potential for this to spread to the rest of Florida’s 21.5 million residents. It would also make the city more attractive for blockchain-related tech companies and events.

Major crypto conference Bitcoin 2021 announced earlier today it was moving from Los Angeles to Miami in June this year.

Although Miami may be the first U.S. city to offer employees salaries in Bitcoin, other companies have also been exploring this.

Multiple metrics like the increasing amount of Ether (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) locked in DeFi, soaring transaction and on-chain activity and the plummeting BTC and Ether reserves of top exchanges show that investors are becoming increasingly interested in cryptocurrency.

Data from CryptoQuant, an on-chain analytics firm, shows that as Ether (ETH) established a new all-time high above $1,500 on Feb. 2, the amount of Ether held on all centralized exchange’s reserves continued to drop to new lows as token holders withdrew their coins.

Many analysts believe that the rapidly expanding DeFi sector, launch of Eth2 and increasing participation from institutional investors are the primary reasons for the drop in BTC and Ether held on centralized exchanges.

The rise of DeFi and yield farming

Each week the number of participants interacting with the DeFi sector seems to reach a new high and as of Feb. 2, the total value locked in DeFi platforms has reached $28.67 billion.

Total value locked in DeFi. Source: Defi Pulse

Data from Defi Pulse shows that the majority of DeFi platforms are built on the Ethereum network and require Ether to transact with the protocol.

In addition to offering attractive ways to earn a yield from simply lending Ether, an increasing amount of the available supply is being directed towards DeFi-related activities and not available for trading purposes.

A similar phenomenon is happening with BTC as holders looking to participate in the DeFi space without selling their Bitcoin have been wrapping them into ERC-20 synthetic versions of Ether.

Platforms like REN and BadgerDAO lead in this effort and a similar drain on the available Bitcoin supply could also be helping to push the price of BTC higher.

Eth2 and extended lock-up staking

Since the launch of the Beacon chain on Dec. 1, 2020, the Eth2 contract has enabled token holders to stake their Ether in the new PoS contract by becoming validators for the network.

Data from the Eth2 Launch Pad shows that there are currently 2,907,298 Ether worth a total of $4.39 billion staked on the network earning an estimated APR of 9.2%

The contract has a multi-year commitment but for holders who refuse to stomach the risk and volatility of DeFi yield farming, Eth2 staking offers a way to earn a yield over time rather than let tokens sit on exchanges or in cold wallets.

Institutional investors begin to see the value proposition of Ether

Since 2020, Bitcoin has received the lion’s share of attention from the institutional investment crowd as investors like MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor lead the way by buying up immense sums of Bitcoin and tweeting non-stop about its estimated future value.

Now that Bitcoin is more than a decade old and seen as more established, firms are increasingly open to looking for the next big opportunity that the cryptocurrency sector has to offer. With the explosion of DeFi and its current dependence on the Ethereum network, Ether is quickly becoming a recommended choice for the institutional investors.

Grayscale Investments temporarily closed their various crypto trusts to new investments in late December following the rise in the price of Bitcoin, but inflow resumed in early January and their total Ether holdings have increased by 242% over the past 3 months.

Coinbase also noted in its annual 2020 review that institutional investors are increasingly seeing Ether as a store of value with “a growing number” of its institutional clients taking a position in the token due to the strong returns offered.

The exchange also noted that while a majority of their clients bought BTC throughout 2020, Ether’s strong finish to the year saw it surpass BTC in terms of price growth and this is a trend which has continued into 2021.

Ark Invest’s latest report, ""Bitcoin: Preparing for Institutions,"" shows that even a paltry allocation of 1% by companies from the S&P 500 could boost Bitcoin’s price by $40,000. However, analysts at Ar believe that the allocation is likely to be in the range of 2.5% to 6.5%, which ""could impact bitcoin’s price by $200,000 to $500,000.""

Even as Bitcoin’s price consolidates and readies for the next leg up, several altcoins have been rising, backed by strong fundamentals and investors' high expectations of their upcoming products. Let’s look at three such tokens today.

BAND/USD

The decentralized finance space has boomed in the past few months, and the success of the protocols rely heavily upon data sources that are decentralized, fast and reliable. This is where Band Protocol steps in. The cross-chain data oracle has announced several partnerships in the past few days, which shows it is gradually building its market share.

The strong rally in stocks such as GameStop, AMC and others have captured traders' attention in the past few days. Band’s tie-up with Injective Protocol to deliver decentralized price oracles for various stocks to be supported on the decentralized derivatives platform could benefit the price of its native token, BAND, as a successful integration would be followed by an increase in demand.

Similarly, Linear Finance, a derivatives asset protocol, will also use Band’s real-time price feeds to offer its clients a seamless trading experience for several synthetic assets.

Band is not limited to only providing price feeds of cryptocurrencies, foreign exchange assets and commodities. Elrond and Band have expanded their partnership further to bridge the two networks to provide off-chain data to various applications being developed on the Elrond network. Other than the usual price feeds, Band will also cater to data requests for sports, gaming, esports and much more.

Along with these, Band has also entered into partnerships with the Moonbeam protocol, Nervos and Fantom in the past few days and broadened its existing partnership with CoinGecko.

BAND price rose from $7.1532 on Jan. 22 to $12.949 on Tuesday, an 81% rally within a short time. Previous to this move, the price had largely been stuck in the range of $7 to $11.50 for the past few days.

The bulls pushed the price above the range on Tuesday, but the long wick on the day’s candlestick shows the bears are aggressively selling at higher levels. This has dragged the price back into the aforementioned trading range.

If the bulls do not give up much ground, then one more attempt to break above the range is likely. The 20-day exponential moving average ($9.28) has started to turn up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive territory, which suggests that the path of least resistance is to the upside.

If the bulls can drive and sustain the price above $11.50, the BAND/USD pair could rally to $16 and then to $17.78. This zone may act as stiff resistance, but if the bulls can propel the price above it, the momentum could further pick up.

Contrary to this assumption, if the bears successfully defend the $11.50–$12.949 resistance zone, the pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.

LRC/USD

The GameStop saga and the trading limits imposed on retail traders by brokerages like Robinhood have exposed their significant flaws. This is likely to draw traders to decentralized exchanges where control does not lie with any central entity.

Transaction fees are an extremely important aspect during trading, especially for smaller-sized traders. So, when Ethereum gas fees increase, these retail traders are the most affected. Loopring attempts to solve this problem with it layer-two scaling.

Data from Dune Analytics shows that Loopring’s fee collection recently surged to its highest-ever level due to increasing volume. The protocol recently updated its LRC tokenomics model and announced a new fee distribution pattern to its various participants. This could further attract LRC investors who may want to benefit from the rising popularity of the protocol.

LRC rose from an intraday low at $0.33651 on Jan. 22 to an intraday high at $0.57618 on Jan. 31, a 71% rally within a few days. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls are in control.

LRC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

The up-move is currently facing resistance near $0.55, and the LRC/USD pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($0.43). This is an important level to watch out for because the pair has taken support at the 20-day EMA on three previous occasions.

If the pair again rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $0.62167. If they succeed, the pair could rally to $0.71773 and then to $0.78.

This bullish view will invalidate if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will suggest that the bulls are not buying the dips anymore, and that could result in a fall to $0.35 and then to the 50-day simple moving average ($0.31).

CREAM/USD

Certain aspects of traditional finance could act as an inspiration to build projects in the decentralized space. Cream Finance recently announced the launch of Iron Bank, which is guided by the success of the $10-trillion U.S. corporate debt market.

While there are several peer-to-peer lending protocols existing in the crypto space, Cream has taken it a step further and created a protocol-to-protocol lending mechanism. The main attraction of the Iron Bank is that it will facilitate zero-collateral lending.

To keep the risk under check, Cream will set a credit limit after whitelisting the protocols. Initially, the Iron Bank is available only for Cream’s partners, but if this project succeeds, it is likely to be a huge positive for the entire DeFi space.

In other news, Cream recently widened its services by adding SushiSwap and Uniswap LP tokens as collateral options for lending and borrowing.

The platform's CREAM token rallied from $119.35 on Jan. 22 to an intraday high at $319.9 on Tuesday, a 168% rally within a short time. The long wick on the day’s candlestick shows that traders aggressively booked profits at higher levels.

CREAM/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView

If the bulls do not allow the price to dip below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $251.65, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. The upsloping 20-day EMA ($181) and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest the advantage to the bulls.

If the bulls can push and sustain the price above $294.80, the CREAM/USD pair could rally to $362 and then to $430.

Conversely, if the bears sink the price below $251.65, the pair could dip to the 61.8% retracement level at $209.45.

According to a report by the American political publication Politico, Tenev is expected to participate in a virtual hearing headed by Representative Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) on Feb. 18. Politico’s report cited anonymous people familiar with the matter.

Waters officially announced the Financial Services Committee’s plans to hold a GameStop-related hearing on Feb. 18. Entitled “Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide,” the hearing will focus on recent market volatility issues involving GameStop and other stocks.

“I am concerned about whether or not Robinhood restricted the trading because there was collusion between Robinhood and some of the hedge funds that were involved with this,” Waters reportedly said.

The announcement did not specify what witnesses will participate in the hearing. Robinhood has not officially announced Tenev’s participation so far. The firm did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.

As previously reported, some U.S. regulators have already drawn attention to Robinhood’s handling the GameStop short squeeze. On Jan. 29, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission hinted that it was looking at Robinhood’s issues with GameStop, expressing concern over “extreme price volatility of certain stocks’ trading prices.”

Robinhood’s GameStop saga started on Jan. 28 when the company suspended buying for GameStop stock and other shares that were allegedly pumped through the r/Wallstreetbets Reddit community. Robinhood subsequently restricted trading for as many as 50 stocks on Friday before narrowing the restrictions to eight stocks on Feb. 8. Still, Robinhood users are limited to just one GameStop share.

On Feb. 1, Robinhood’s Tenev discussed the firm’s move to restrict trading with Elon Musk on the audio chat app Clubhouse. Tenev reportedly said that the decision about restrictions was made by a clearinghouse and was based on the capital requirements. He also denied allegations that trading firm Citadel Securities — the largest market maker in options in the U.S. — had pushed the firm to impose the limits.","['stocks', 'gamestop', 'ceo', 'trading', 'house', 'committee', 'feb', 'robinhoods', 'testify', 'hearing', 'reportedly', 'robinhood', 'tenev', 'firm']","Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev will reportedly testify before the United States House Financial Services Committee over the firm’s role in the volatile trading of GameStop and other volatile stocks.

According to its website, Robinhood has lowered its list of restrictions to eight different stocks including GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, Express, Genius Brands International, Koss, Naked Brand Group and Nokia. Robinhood previously limited trading for as many as 50 stocks on Friday, CNBC reported.

As per the new restrictions, Robinhood users can still only buy one share of GameStop alongside five options contracts. AMC trading is capped at 10 shares and 10 options contracts.

Robinhood users who already hold a greater number of shares or contracts will have to sell their holdings in order to open more positions, the firm said:

“If you already hold a greater number of shares or contracts than the limits listed above, your positions will not be sold or closed. However, you will not be able to open more positions of each of these securities unless you sell enough of your holdings such that you are below the respective limit.”

Robinhood has been struggling to maintain its trading services while the r/Wallstreetbets Reddit community pumps stocks like GME to new all-time highs. On Thursday, Robinhood suspended GME purchases after the stock skyrocketed 1,400% from about $20 on Jan. 12. On Friday, the firm also temporarily disabled instant deposits for cryptocurrency purchases, citing “extraordinary market conditions.”

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission subsequently hinted that it was looking into the Robinhood platform, citing concerns over “extreme price volatility of certain stocks’ trading prices.”

Robinhood’s decision to halt GME trading was widely criticized in the trading community, with at least 100,000 negative reviews appearing on Robinhood’s page on the Google Play Store. Despite Google’s subsequent move to scrap thousands of negative reviews with its “fake review” tracking system, Robinhood app’s rating is still down to one star, with 294,954 reviews posted at publishing time.

Amid the ongoing issues, Robinhood users launched the “#robinhoodboycott” tag on Twitter, calling on traders to move their holdings off the platform. However, Robinhood is not the only company experiencing issues due to the GameStop short squeeze. On Saturday, online trading platform IG Group Holdings said that it will restrict any new positions on GME and AMC due to “extreme volatility” in the market.","['users', 'stocks', 'gamestop', 'share', 'trading', 'platform', 'positions', 'limited', 'robinhood', 'shares', 'holdings', 'gme']","Troubled trading app Robinhood has been narrowing the list of restricted stocks on its platform but is still keeping major restrictions on GameStop shares.

In his letter to employees, Bezos said that he would be transitioning to the role of executive chair of the Amazon board, where he would “focus my energies and attention on new products and early initiatives.” The transition is scheduled for later in the year.

Bezos also noted that Jassy “will be an outstanding leader, and has my full confidence.”

The crypto world’s attention now turns to Jassy’s history when it comes to embracing blockchain technology, as it could be an indication of the long-term crypto strategy of the world’s third-most valuable company by market capitalization.

Jassy offered a mixed review of blockchain technology and its applicability to Amazon's business in 2017. In a statement at the Amazon ""re:Invent"" conference, he expressed doubt that blockchain could be used for more than a “distributed ledger” but also said he and his team were personally interested. However, company policy dictated that they don't “build technology [just] because we think it is cool.”

He did leave the door open for future exploration, however, saying, “We are very intrigued by what customers are ultimately going to do there.”

In 2018, Jassy did move forward with a “quasi-blockchain” offering, as he oversaw the launch of two blockchain products: Amazon Quantum Ledger Database and Amazon Managed Blockchain. As Cointelegraph reported, the products maintained centralized databases but included cryptographic qualities.

Aside from these forays, Amazon has largely only made crypto headlines as a scapegoat: In November 2020, Coinbase blamed an AWS outage for one of its frequent service interruptions.

“Buy crypto” searches on Google surged to all-time highs in January, far exceeding the previous peak of early 2018, according to cryptocurrency analytics company The Tie.

Relative search interest for the term ""Buy Crypto"" is at all-time high on Google Trends pic.twitter.com/4cFIkI0xbp — The TIE (@TheTIEIO) February 1, 2021

The keyword received a perfect Google Trends score of 100, which indicates maximum relative interest.

A similar spike was also observed for Ethereum, which achieved a perfect score of 100 before falling back down to a still-strong 65.

Bitcoin (BTC) searches also spiked, but remain well below the 2017 bull market high.

The Tie also shared the following chart with Cointelegraph, which highlights a sharp rise in searches for “best crypto app” and “best crypto exchange.”

“Relative search interest for popular crypto terms is at an all-time high on Google Trends,” Treyce Dahlem, research analyst at The Tie, to Cointelegraph.

He continued:

“Whether this is due to the recent price rallies that we’ve seen, speculative traders from Reddit looking to leave their mark on more assets, or even a macro shift in the way investors are searching for a hedge against inflation, one thing is clear: There is a rapidly growing interest in crypto and new investors are looking for the best way to get into the ecosystem.”

The explosive search trends seem to coincide with growing retail interest in both Ethereum and altcoins. Ether’s (ETH) price has doubled since the start of the year, having just reached a new all-time high above $1,500.

Meanwhile, the overall cryptocurrency market in January reached $1 trillion for the first time. While the initial spike was largely due to Bitcoin, altcoins have supported the trillion-dollar valuation with greater intensity over the past month. In the process, Bitcoin’s dominance rate has fallen to 62% from a high of 72% in early January.

Google search trends are sometimes correlated with movements in the overall cryptocurrency market. Higher relative searches signal growing retail awareness of digital assets, which is often a precursor to wider speculative adoption.

The Tie revealed to Cointelegraph that social media engagement surrounding crypto has also skyrocketed. On Twitter, aggregate tweet volumes devoted to cryptocurrency reached 3.3 million in January, up from 1.3 million in September 2020. January’s aggregate tweet volume was 181% higher than a year earlier.","['buy', 'google', 'hit', 'tie', 'search', 'cryptocurrency', 'trends', 'interest', 'crypto', 'record', 'alltime', 'searches', 'high']","If Google search trends are anything to go by, crypto euphoria appears to be on the rise again, according to new industry research.

According to an announcement from Cash App, its clearing broker, Axos, halted the app’s ability to complete purchases of stocks for GameStop, AMC Entertainment, Nokia and Koss Corporation — at least four of the stocks pushed by retail investors on the r/Wallstreetbets subreddit in their fight against hedge funds’ shorts. However, the app later tweeted that the broker has restored trading for AMC and Nokia.

Cash App initially said that it “wholeheartedly” disagreed with Axos’ actions and added that it would attempt to allow users to purchase all the affected stocks “as soon as possible.” The platform has not mentioned any change in the status of trading GameStop and Koss Corporation stocks, but the price of GME fell under $100 for the first time in a week, reaching $99.50 at the time of publication.

Though it appeared that Cash App was trying to distance itself from any possible allegations of market manipulation in the wake of the GameStop short sells, the restrictions on buys were similar to those imposed by other trading apps last week.

Robinhood announced on Thursday that it had suspended buying for GameStop stock and others after many of the stocks surged. The trading app has since lowered these restrictions, but its users are still limited to buying one GME share as of yesterday.

Many on social media seemed to place the blame for restricting trading on Axos rather than Cash App, but they still expressed their frustration after the parallels with Robinhood.

“Thank you for the transparency,” said Twitter user Phoenix Williams. “Robinhood was under the same situation but they chose to lie.”

The excitement surrounding this project has electrified several major Chinese cities, as well as onlookers throughout the world.

Most recently, Shenzhen launched its “iShenzhen” lottery, wherein the city government will distribute 20 million digital yuan among 100,000 central bank digital currency, or CBDC, wallet holders. This comes on the back of a similar lottery held in the city of Suzhou, one of China’s major “special economic zones.” Suzhou has already engaged with several blockchain projects in an effort to deepen the municipality’s understanding and use of decentralized technology, smart contracts and the general learning curve the local population may face.

Related: China turns up pace on CBDC release, tests infrastructure prior to adoption

As China continues to cement itself in the international economy, it is proving to be a leader in the race toward CBDC adoption, an initiative that would make Chinese goods and services more accessible within the global marketplace. Many experts in the fields of fiscal policy and financial technology have argued that the digitization of public money is an inevitable consequence of distributed ledger technology.

The particular political and economic ramifications of this switch to digital currency will depend on the specific decisions of governments regarding their approaches to these new technologies. China, for example, has adopted an approach that has seen repeated success throughout contemporary business culture.

A number of other nations, with economies of all sizes, are more or less waiting in the wings as the People’s Bank of China demonstrates its leadership. In the Suzhou and Shenzhen experiments, citizens are allotted digital yuan and encouraged to link their digital wallets to their existing PBoC accounts, and if they do not use the digital currency within a few weeks, it disappears.

Nations are especially eager to see how this program unfolds and how adoption looks at the grassroots level. Businesses and governments have a natural incentive to embrace this technology, as it reduces overhead and friction, which enhances their bottom line. However, for citizens whose motives might not be tied to financial gain, which other incentives will prompt them to start using an entirely different system of money and banking? These aforementioned adoption trends will be a key driver that determines how quickly other nations will begin developing their own CBDCs.

Related: Did CBDCs affect the crypto space in 2020, and what’s next in 2021? Experts answer

Smaller nations have a better chance for quicker launches

This experiment has excited economic participation within China and roused interest from public banks across the world. Which countries have positioned themselves to follow China into the digital future? Certainly, China’s influence, as well as a long-standing pro-technology culture throughout the continent, suggests that many East Asian countries may follow suit. The Bank of Thailand launched a CBDC pilot program back in June 2020. Moreover, just last fall, the Bank of Korea announced plans for a 2021 CBDC issuance, while Japanese banking officials have articulated a more cautious, passive course of interest following China’s CBDC.

Smaller nations, of course, have a different set of obstacles in their financial experimentation. Recently, the Bahamas introduced its “Sand Dollar” and Cambodia its “Bakong,” following China’s example. This is made possible, however, by the smaller size of these national banking systems that allow them to move with greater agility as well as a degree of autonomy. This becomes an advantage for smaller nations, as the global dependence on their currency is also smaller, so the interoperability issues are of a lesser priority than for global economies like the United States and China where it becomes a highly critical aspect.

However, larger nations are also showing greater interest. A year-long research report published recently by the central banks of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates shows that the early adoption of digital currencies is favorable — particularly for major economies that have operated with relatively higher degrees of autonomy, unlike those in the eurozone or a part of the North American Free Trade Association, for example. Like China, the Saudi and Emirati governments, given their manufacturing and natural resources, do not accrue as much debt as is standard in other major economies in the West.

This brings to light an interesting aspect of CBDC adoption, one that may influence the process of digitization across the world’s public banks. While a huge number of factors determine how and when a particular economy may adopt digital currency — such as its size, the preexisting economic landscape, its gross domestic product, etc. — an important aspect seems to be a strong national (as opposed to global) economic program. This is interesting not only because it flags particular nations as being predisposed to CBDCs but also because it highlights the importance of interoperability after a currency has been instituted. These digitization programs, in other words, will be brought about through strong national economic policy control, but in order to uphold the global systems that we live in, these technologies will need to interact through intermediary programs.

Interoperability is highly critical for major economies

With a push to all the global CBDC initiatives, the Bank of International Settlements’ Innovation Hub, or BISIH, announced that CBDC research is a top priority for it in 2021. It plans to gauge the feasibility of faster, cheaper cross-border payments. This initiative is going to be highly beneficial for global economies exploring the interoperability of their own CBDC projects using BISIH research and pilot tests to facilitate their own CBDC program and by working with them for all settlements and cross-border payment concerns.

While focusing on domestic use cases is understandable for individual countries, CBDCs will only ever operate in local sandboxes unless there is some type of interoperable protocol. It is critical to bridge the gaps between the various CBDC initiatives and existing payments systems as well as other digital currencies to ensure their success on a global scale.

While governments exploring the use of CBDCs is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, truly borderless, global commerce will be powered with the help of an interoperable protocol, as our economic system is too multifaceted to be replaced by a singular currency.
