That one word addition caused the price of bitcoin to spike to a 10-day high of $38,020 and sparked $387 million worth of short liquidations on major exchanges including Binance, Bitfinex, BitMEX, ByBit, Deribit, FTX, HuobiDM and OKEx.

The crypto market leader is trading at $37,390 at press time, representing a more than 15% gain from the low of $32,000 seen during the European morning session.

Today’s short liquidation is the largest since Jan. 2, when exchanges closed $575 million worth of shorts, according to data provider Coinalyze.

Forced closure of short positions happens when the price moves above a predetermined threshold, signaling the liquidation engine to “square off,” or close, the positions. A massive short squeeze like this often puts upward pressure on prices, leading to a bullish move.

Market was skewed bearish

Data indicates the market was skewed bearish early Monday and some observers were anticipating a price drop, courtesy of increased inflows onto exchanges.

However, sentiment turned bullish after Musk changed his Twitter bio and tweeted: “In retrospect, it was inevitable.” The Tesla and SpaceX CEO, who has made no secret of his loathing for short-sellers, may not haven intended to have caused the liquidations, but may have popped the cork on a bottle of champagne after viewing the carnage his bio change wrought.

To document Elon’s ostensible nod to the leading cryptocurrency, F2Pool, currently the largest mining pool by hashrate, embedded the tech mogul’s latest tweet in Bitcoin block 668,197.

Google searches for “bitcoin,” a barometer of widespread interest, surged following Musk’s cryptic endorsement of bitcoin. It remains to be seen if increased interest translates into more buying and stronger price gains.

“I assume the U.S. session will try to follow in lock-step of digesting the news,” Vishal Shah, an options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5, told CoinDesk. “Typically speaking, such things would be met with more muted response. But given the backdrop, I think it could be ripe for a follow-through.”

So bitcoin is looking north, having pierced a two-week bearish trendline on the daily chart. Resistance is seen at $40,112 (Jan. 14 high), followed by the psychological level of $42,000.

Attention on Aave proved to be well spent: This time last year, Aave only had a few million dollars worth of crypto in it; since then it has risen to become the second largest DeFi project on Ethereum, with over $3 billion in crypto committed to its smart contracts.

Nevertheless, over the last year, Kulechov also invested in something like three-dozen projects. Clearly, his stance on angel investing has changed.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

“I think everyone should do angel investing in the space, especially if you gained,” Kulechov told CoinDesk in an interview.

Kulechov justifies devoting part of his time to angel investing because he has come to see it as a defensive move for his company. It’s like the internet: Once enough people have started using and relying on a tech stack, it becomes very nearly impossible to yank it back out of their hands.

“When the ecosystem is big enough, I believe it is very difficult at that point to fight against the technology,” Kulechov said.

The best the banking system could hope to do, he believes, is decide to build its own version of DeFi, but, “that will not work when you have so many projects in the ecosystem and the ecosystem is growing all the time,” Kulechov said.

Dark forest

The term “ecosystem” gets thrown around a lot but Kulechov contends it is uniquely apt in DeFi.

In an ecosystem, things are living off each other but also supporting each other. Species evolve in a specific context and everything is relative. Kulechov sees the same thing happening on Ethereum.

“An ecosystem means you are sharing things together. You are sharing, you are consuming and you are supplying, and you are doing all of these three things together,” he said.

Take Yearn Finance for example. It takes advantage of composability by building other smart contracts into its smart contracts. In exchange, it also pumps a lot of additional liquidity into those protocols by way of its own various interfaces. It also consumes the yield that comes from the backers it supplies. It’s a virtuous cycle.

“We have smart contracts and we have composability,” Kulechov said, “but also we have an element of human composability.”

Kulechov backs a lot of teams but not everyone. The question he’s trying to answer when making picks is: How creative is this team? He said he likes to ask them what they are looking to build next and then maybe after that as well. He needs to see a fertile mind that’s always ready to innovate, because that’s the only way to keep adding value.

Picks

CoinDesk sees Kulechov’s name on press releases about new startups all the time. For example, we’ve reported his backing of Lido, Maple, Slingshot, Swivel and PoolTogether.

Aave itself raised a fresh $25 million last October, ahead of releasing its new version in December.

But when asked to name some investments that are on his mind, he named three specific ones he’s made in small, new teams that haven’t gotten a ton of attention yet.

Pods Finance. A derivatives product that’s designed to work without oracles.

Kulechov said he liked Pods because it was a team of very young people from Brazil who were traveling around to hackathons to build out early versions of their product.

Certora. A smart-contract security consultancy that specializes in formal verification.

“It’s kind of a traditional business model,” Kulechov said. Certora stands out in the crypto space because it’s a bunch of security researchers who simply provide a service in exchange for payment, without a token or DAO in sight.

Shell Protocol. An upstart automated market maker (AMM) for stablecoins aiming to enable money for the internet.

“What for me was interesting was the whole story of how they moved to Hawaii,” Kulechov said. The team has a “Hawaii House” on the beach listed as a perk for new hires. New employees aren’t required to live there but encouraged to at least come and hang out a while.

Kulechov said he’s been pleased to see some decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregators routing orders through this relatively small protocol, which has a big mission to reinvent money. That said, “They don’t make any noise,” Kulechov said.

Principles

Kulechov contends he doesn’t have strict investing principles, but obviously he likes to see people embrace DeFi values: transparency, open source and the like.

One point he does like to stress, though, is he prefers to make investments in the tokens generated by his own project, Aave. So rather than sending a team a bunch of USDC, he’d rather send them aUSDC, because then they already have some yield built in.

Treasury management is obviously important for any team, but: “If you take interest-bearing tokens it’s actually managed,” Kulechov said.

The point there is to keep projects sustainable on the micro level. Investing does the same for DeFi on the macro level.","['defi', 'defis', 'founder', 'aaves', 'head', 'banks', 'angel', 'kulechov', 'thats', 'start', 'team', 'invests', 'ecosystem', 'grow', 'aave', 'investing', 'things', 'smart']","Stani Kulechov used to think angel investing would distract him from leading his company, Aave, one of the top money markets in decentralized finance (DeFi).

This was the week the internet finally defeated Wall Street – at least for a few days. The wild rally in GameStop’s stock, fueled by an army of Reddit retail day traders, imposed devastating losses on hedge funds and showed how free trading tools and social media (memes) can now be harnessed by networks of individuals to achieve economic outcomes previously controlled by elites. The gobsmacking story of GameStop, Melvin Capital and r/WallStreetbets was tailor-made for the disruptive, anti-establishment vibe of the crypto community. This “WSB effect” theme runs throughout this week’s newsletter.

On the other side of the masses vs. establishment divide, this was also the week of the “Davos Agenda” virtual event, held in lieu of the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting. It included the likes of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Chinese President Xi Zinping, a host of Fortune 500 CEOs and so forth.

My podcast co-host Sheila Warren, who happens to be the WEF’s blockchain lead, invited long-time WEF Managing Director Adrian Monck to this week’s “Money Reimagined” show. We talked directly about how the old guard deals with the changes that radical outsiders, such as crypto developers and tribes of activist retail investors, present. Have a listen at the link below after reading this week’s newsletter.

BTC and ETH: Made for each other

As of 11:00 a.m. ET Friday, the year-to-date returns for bitcoin and ether show an easily discernible reversal of the BTC dominance seen in late 2020. Bitcoin is up 27% year to date and ether, 92%.

What’s going on here? Well, before we try to answer that, a caveat: If the past week’s WallStreetBets-vs-hedge funds spectacle has taught us anything, it’s that in today’s meme-consuming, radically democratizing markets, confidently defining fundamental reasons for price movements is difficult. What matters is which narrative is winning.

Well, before we try to answer that, a caveat: If the past week’s WallStreetBets-vs-hedge funds spectacle has taught us anything, it’s that in today’s meme-consuming, radically democratizing markets, confidently defining fundamental reasons for price movements is difficult. What matters is which narrative is winning. Narrative? So prices are just make-believe? Well, yes, but stories have always been about how people – and thus markets – reach consensus. It used to be Wall Street controlled the narrative. It’s unclear whether that’s still the case.

Well, yes, but stories have always been about how people – and thus markets – reach consensus. It used to be Wall Street controlled the narrative. It’s unclear whether that’s still the case. So, what narrative best explains ETH outperforming BTC? Well, let’s first challenge the “Tulip Bubble” angle that mainstream crypto critics might instinctively apply here: The idea this is a rerun of the 2017 bitcoin rally, which pushed speculators into comparatively cheaper tokens only to foster the mother of all bubbles. The loss suffered this week by short-selling hedge funds at the expense of hordes of retail investors from the r/WallStreetBets subreddit shows it’s dangerous to conclude that large groups of determined bulls are inherently wrong.



This is not to say ETH’s price won’t correct as bitcoin’s has this month. It just means we owe it to ourselves to explore other narratives.

This is not to say ETH’s price won’t correct as bitcoin’s has this month. It just means we owe it to ourselves to explore other narratives. Such as? Here’s one: There’s a BTC-to-ETH price rotation going on that suggests thoughtful investors are starting to see Ethereum, and more specifically the decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built on it, as a constructive complement to Bitcoin. As sophisticated investors increasingly recognize bitcoin’s potential as a “digital gold” store of wealth, the thesis goes, they will soon see DeFi as a means to creatively unlock that value – for payments, for loans, for insurance, and so forth.



This take sees Bitcoin as the base layer protocol for a software stack that handles the internet’s value storage and exchange. Bitcoin the currency is a simple yet hard-to-change, highly secure store of value. Much like gold, it doesn’t do much; you just lock it away and use it as security to back up your other investments and financial activity. But because it’s built on a permissionless protocol, developers can still do many more creative things with it than, say, a gold custodian can do with bullion.



That’s where Ethereum and DeFi come in. With smart contracts, oracles, decentralized exchanges and multi-sig systems for securing digital assets, the degens of DeFi are now incorporating bitcoin into their freewheeling, “composable” world of decentralized financial products. Hence the summer explosion of wrapped bitcoin tokens such as WBTC.



To go back to the software stack analogy, Ethereum is middleware and DeFi occupies the application layer.

(Moe Na/CoinDesk)

Analogies are also being made to the traditional finance “stack.” RealVision CEO Raoul Pal says bitcoin is “pristine collateral” that could even take on the $123 trillion market for U.S. Treasury bonds as the base-level security for all credit. It’s appeal is not only that it’s a provably scarce asset, but also that it can be locked up in escrow through a decentralized smart contract that leaves neither lenders nor borrowers vulnerable to the failures of a middleman. You build DeFi’s lending, borrowing and insuring products on top of that feature and you now have the makings of a financial system.

Asked by CoinDesk contributor Jeff Wilser if he would ever see bitcoin as something more than a speculative investment, Dallas Mavericks owner and CNBC “Shark Tank” personality Mark Cuban responded, “Sure. If DeFi and BTC can evolve together in a manner that allows BTC to effectively be a bank account without the bank. That creates utility for BTC.” What does he think of Ethereum? “I like ETH. Obviously it’s a primary foundation for DeFi, and we will see what happens with ETH 2.”

Obviously it’s a primary foundation for DeFi, and we will see what happens with ETH 2.” Ah, Eth 2. The Elephant in the Room. If Ethereum 2.0 succeeds, over the next couple of years the blockchain will transition from a proof-of-work consensus model to proof-of-stake and will allow massively more transaction-processing capability. That scalability is needed if Ethereum is to play a meaningful role in the global financial system. But the transition is incredibly difficult to pull off within a large, decentralized community of users where billions of dollars are at stake.



Still, there seems to be early optimism around Eth 2.0. The amount of ether locked and staked on the transitional Beacon Chain has steadily risen to more than 2.8 million ETH as of Wednesday (an amount currently worth about $3.89 billion). Indeed, ether’s steady January gain to an all-time high of $1,476.12 on Sunday was itself an expression of confidence in that project.

There’s a boom in non-fungible tokens, also captured in the Cuban interview. And there’s support, including from suddenly in-the-news social media platform Reddit, for using so-called layer 2 scaling solutions such as Plasma to expand Ethereum’s use cases. Meanwhile, EY blockchain lead Paul Brody is predicting financial institutions will bring DeFi to the masses.



All of this points to an expanding and diversifying Ethereum ecosystem. For a blockchain, that’s the best story you can tell: a growing network.

Did Trump help bitcoin’s late-2020 surge?

Since we’re talking about narratives, let’s look at how we might visually represent a market-justifying story. I’ve chosen a take by CoinDesk Global News Editor Kevin Reynolds on the role played by fears of electoral chaos on bitcoin’s price rise during the late fall and early winter. I can buy this story: If bitcoin is digital gold, it should work as a backstop against dystopia. But what I also found interesting was how easy it was to illustrate this idea on a chart. I just grabbed a few election-related statements by former President Donald Trump and his supporters, got CoinDesk data visualizer Shuai Hao to mark them on a four-month chart from our subsidiary company TradeBlock and the yellow line did the rest.

TradeBlock XBX (Shuai Hao/CoinDesk) Source: https://tradeblock.com/markets/index

(NOTE: This chart was produced late Thursday New York time, before bitcoin’s huge leap to a new post-Jan. 8 high of $38,000 early Friday morning. The story may need a new chapter. Arrival of the WSB effect?)

Kevin argues that electoral fear added an extra $10,000 to the all-time high that was hit right after the climactic Jan. 6 raid on Congress. The rest of the gains came from the standard stuff everyone was talking about: mainly that institutional investors were now adding bitcoin to their long-term portfolios. So, when things simmered down and new President Joseph Biden was sworn in, bitcoin’s price eased to what would be fair value in normal times – you know, amid a normal global pandemic and economic depression.

The Conversation: Ants vs. elephants

In 2014, when the idea of decentralized autonomous organizations was first being kicked around, crypto pioneer and DAO enthusiast Joel Dietz founded a decentralized fundraising platform called “Swarm.” (It has since evolved into Swarm Capital, which provides tools for companies to issue security tokens.) The name always struck me as an evocative one for an entity comprising many individuals without centralized control.

Now, after digesting this heady week on Wall Street, the term seems especially apt. I’m talking, of course, about how retail investors in a Subreddit that quickly swelled to 4.4 million people collectively forced big hedge funds into a “short squeeze” on supposedly has-been “meme stocks” such as GameStop, AMC Entertainment and BlackBerry. The WSB group maneuver imposed billions of dollars of losses on those institutions. Melvin Capital needed an injection of $2.75 billion from Citadel and Point72. One thinks of a swarm of ants attacking elephants.

That the name stems from a crypto venture is also fitting since the WSB saga prompted an outpouring of interest from the crypto community. It had all the elements of a crypto drama, even though the battle never occurred on a blockchain.

For one, there was a much-discussed CNBC interview with Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya, who had spent time trawling through the r/WallStreetBets posts and, following the group’s lead, made a $500,000 profit. Declaring that what he “learned over the last couple of days is important for everybody that’s watching CNBC,” Chamath said the insurgent investor movement was “a pushback against the establishment in a very important way,” one that harked back to the 2008 financial crisis. It captured the rebellious, anti-Wall Street vibe that’s long been part of the crypto community.

As the drama unfolded, Crypto Twitter lit up with people drawing parallels with and lessons about the crypto scene.

In a tweet thread about people demanding change to a system rigged for the big guys, Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz said the movement was “a giant endorsement of DeFi.”

Then, on Thursday, when the Redditors’ favored trading app, Robinhood, shut down access to the the stocks in question – creating a vitriolic backlash in what one observer called the trading app’s own “Streisand Effect” – the crypto community leapt to remind the world that this could never happen on a decentralized exchange. It was the perfect opportunity for Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift, to weigh in about his company’s new decentralized offering.

Then, inevitably, the WSB phenomenon spread into the crypto world’s very own “meme token,” Dogecoin, which soared more than 800% to a new record high.

CoinDesk’s own Will Foxley couldn’t resist:

Relevant Reads: Dabbling, not diving

Going into the year-end was an exciting period for bitcoiners. Many large-name investors emerged to declare their appreciation of bitcoin’s potential and the price responded accordingly.

As the price dropped back in the latter part of January, the “institutions are coming” rallying cry tempered. Big-name investors still showed interest in bitcoin, but some of their messages emphasized their caution and focused on the challenges they still see bitcoin facing before it attains a widely recognized place in institutional portfolios. CoinDesk’s coverage this past week captured that. (We’ll have to see how next week’s stories look if bitcoin holds the gains it enjoyed Friday morning and as these institutions take stock of the powerful reckoning they’ve been confronted via a retail investor insurrection.)

Guggenheim Partners Chief Investment Officer Scott Minerd, who made waves last year when he assigned a long-term target of $400,000 to bitcoin, didn’t exactly retract that prediction but added an implicit “not any time soon” caveat. In a Bloomberg interview he said, “Right now, the reality of the institutional demand that would support a $35,000 price or even a $30,000 price is just not there.” After Friday’s jump, that comment is looking a little off.

Journalists are always looking for comments from Dallas Mavericks owner and CNBC “Shark Tank” personality Marc Cuban. Crypto journalists are no exception. So, we were thrilled that CoinDesk contributor Jeff Wilser had a rich exchange with Cuban this week. As discussed above, Cuban sees real potential in bitcoin, especially if it can team up with DeFi. But as a standalone investment for now, his current view is, let’s say, “meh.”

We’ve also long been trying to get legendary Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio’s thoughts on bitcoin. He has remained mostly skeptical, even if his tone has become moderately more upbeat over time and his view has emerged only via small snippets of commentary. Finally, in his widely read Daily Observations newsletter, Dalio and his team have delivered a detailed, deep-dive analysis of bitcoin’s opportunities and challenges. I’d say Dalio still has a small amount of learning to do – for example, on why bitcoin can’t easily be replaced by a “better” cryptocurrency – but otherwise this is a brilliant analysis. His team’s assessment of bitcoin’s infamous volatility and why that makes it hard for portfolio managers to adopt it as loss-mitigating uncorrelated asset is masterful. (Oh, and I’m super excited to tell you that Dalio will be a headline keynote at CoinDesk’s Consensus event in May. Stay tuned for more exciting speaker announcements as we update the events page.)

Perhaps the most important news of the week on the institutional investor side was Ian Allison’s scoop that the trustees who run the endowments of Harvard, Yale, Brown and other universities have been investing in bitcoin for over a year. What we need to know is why. The colleges are, for now, keeping the justification for their entry into this market close to their chest. Without that, it’s hard to know whether they’ll keep it up.","['defi', 'investors', 'cant', 'decentralized', 'street', 'narratives', 'week', 'bitcoin', 'price', 'ethereum', 'wall', 'eth', 'bitcoins', 'michael', 'casey', 'control', 'crypto']","This was the week the internet finally defeated Wall Street – at least for a few days.

It all started when retail investors on the Reddit community wallstreetbets began pumping the price of U.S. video game retailer GameStop’s (GME) stock to counter Wall Street hedge funds that were “shorting” or betting against it. What the Reddit group did, and the reaction of the mainstream as the stock skyrocketed, reminded many of crypto trading.

Meanwhile, the world watches, with some seeing what happened with GameStop as a more global story of ordinary investors taking on the power of big institutions.

“We are very much interested in what is happening in the U.S. for many reasons. For some of us, it is the feeling that we can now also play in the market and we are also seeing how the markets actually get manipulated to serve only the rich. This isn’t a movie. … We saw this happen,” Bernard Parah, founder and chief executive officer of Nigerian crypto trading startup Bitnob, told CoinDesk via an email.

According to Parah, Nigerian investors were buying GME using a number of apps including Bamboo and Trove, which allow U.S. equity trading.

In India, small retail investors were quick to jump in on the action, with GameStop becoming one of the top five traded stocks on Stockal, a platform used by Indian investors to trade U.S. equities, according to Bloomberg.

Retail investors in China also wanted in, with some users excitedly sharing their gains on social media. There are about 177 million retail investors in China.

After the U.S. retail trading platform Robinhood limited users from buying certain trending stocks including GME, European investors who still had access continued to trade: wallstreetbets alleged that they helped keep the GME price up despite the trading restrictions.

“GME makes you feel the power of the people around the world. … After the Europeans, Asian people are joining the fight to support the movement. It makes your blood boil just by watching it,” one Chinese user wrote on popular social media app Weibo.

Meanwhile, the Reddit investors’ strategy to counter shorted stocks went global, according to Bloomberg journalist Tracy Alloway: Bloomberg reported earlier this week that heavily shorted stocks were rallying in Australia and Japan. Nikkei Asia reported the same trend was seen in Hong Kong and Malaysia.

Crypto Spillover

The turmoil didn’t stop there. Soon, Reddit investors were pumping other shorted or meme stocks including dogecoin (DOGE), a cryptocurrency that was created as a joke. DOGE started rallying after a Twitter user calling himself the chairman of wallstreetbets (though who is not affiliated with the subreddit) asked followers about the cryptocurrency.

Responding to the hype, Nigerian social payments app Bundle Africa listed dogecoin on Friday. An hour later, it was the second-most bought asset on Bundle that day.

“We are definitely feeling the spillover in crypto as people move to buy DOGE as a reaction to what’s been happening in the U.S.,” Yele Bademosi, chief executive officer of Bundle, told CoinDesk via Twitter.

Colombian investors were getting curious about dogecoin, Alejandro Beltrán, country manager of crypto exchange Buda.com told CoinDesk. Buda.com does not list Dogecoin, and it has no current plans to do so, Beltrán added.

Some users in Japan watched the dogecoin price run with skepticism, with one user comparing it to a local meme-based cryptocurrency called monacoin.

“It is a remarkable activity in the market this week, and one which is yet to be determined as healthy or otherwise,” Jon Squires, chief executive officer of crypto exchange Currency.com, told CoinDesk.

According to Squires, on Thursday, the platform had 10 times the typical number of new clients.

Chaos ensued. Retail traders everywhere cried foul, accusing the startup brokerage of protecting hedge funds and the establishment at their expense. U.S. politicians across the spectrum, from Rep. AOC to Sen. Ted Cruz, came together to lambast the move on Twitter. Venture capitalists and technologists called into question the morality of Robinhood’s founders and proclaimed that the moment for decentralization had finally arrived.

Robinhood did not halt trading of GameStop to punish the insurgent mass of retail traders. Nor did it do so out of a paternalistic impulse to try to protect them. Robinhood halted trading of GameStop because it had to, thanks to a set of standards put in place by market players upstream. Robinhood’s clearing firm, the company that facilitates the settlement of the broker-dealer’s trades, could not keep up with the risk it was being asked to take on.

Jill Carlson, a CoinDesk columnist, is co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, a non-profit research organization working to guarantee the right to a free and open financial system. She is also an investor in early-stage startups with Slow Ventures.

Clearing firms exist in part to mitigate the consequences should a broker-dealer fail to meet its obligations. Clearing firms therefore need to keep a tight handle on risk. This means they need to put up more money to make good on trades as markets get whackier and whackier (that is, as volatility increases). The GameStop market was about as whacky as it gets. The clearing firm couldn’t take on any more risk. Robinhood couldn’t fork over any more funds to the clearing firm. The music had to stop.

These are precisely the type of controls that became so clearly important in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis: strict risk management, transparency, liquidity thresholds, and capital requirements. These standards were designed to prevent reckless behavior and to mitigate the fallout should a financial firm become overexposed. When retail traders demanded these rules be implemented on big institutions 10 years ago, they couldn’t have imagined those rules would someday shut them out of the market.

Yesterday highlights the importance of understanding all of the boring nuances of trading back offices and the standards, rules, regulations and protocols that go along with them. Settling a trade takes two days. Thus, clearing firms have two days of exposure to their counterparty firm.

Why does it take two days? People love to say this is a technology issue and that innovations like blockchains can fix this. The reality is, as with so many things that people claim blockchains can fix that this issue is almost entirely one of process and regulation. Perhaps new technology can be a catalyst to revisit these, but it is certainly not the limiting factor.

The Securities and Exchange Commission mandates settlement periods for securities to keep processes among counterparties running smoothly. There are plenty of short-term securities that do settle the same day like certificates of deposit and commercial paper. Equities take as long as they do in part because of historical precedent, dating from the times when technology was indeed the constraint. Every financial institution became accustomed to the processes involved in multi-day settlement periods. Financial institutions are generally slowly evolving creatures, meaning that which they are used to is that which they prefer. Because their processes are built around multi-day settlement, they continue to choose multi-day settlement. The solution to this is not a blockchain anymore than it is a centralized database.

Robinhood halted trading of GameStop because it had to, thanks to a set of standards put in place by market players upstream.

It is so tempting to turn these conversations into conversations about technology. If only we had a decentralized financial trading platform, we would be saved from the censorship imposed by Robinhood or clearing firms or the SEC, the thinking goes. If only we had equities on a blockchain, we would be saved from two day settlement periods and the risks and inefficiencies they impose.

But the issues lie not with the technology. They lie with the way the protocols, processes, rules and laws around the market were designed. And these kinds of issues do not go away no matter how decentralized your trading venue is or how many blockchains you are using.

There are, to be sure, many archaic and obsolete practices that those in charge of the markets continue to adhere to. But it is all too easy to blindly rail against these or to blame them on technology without examining where these practices came from or why they exist. In the most extreme cases, these processes prevail for risk management reasons. In more innocuous cases, these practices simply emerged from the human behavior of those interacting with the markets.

When XRP was de-platformed earlier this month by Coinbase and many others there was not a sudden rush of liquidity and activity on decentralized exchanges that list the asset. That is because traders did not want to touch the asset given the regulatory concerns around the asset.

Take also the question of whether markets should be open and active 24 hours, 7 days per week, 365 days per year. This is another area where I frequently hear people saying that new technology would resolve this, pointing to cryptocurrency markets that are always open. But there are already plenty of mainstream markets that are always open. All over-the-counter markets work this way on Wall Street. If I want to do an over-the-counter trade, I can theoretically call up a market maker any time and ask for a price. In all likelihood, though, I don’t want to. I want to wait for times when there is liquidity.

So much of how the financial market works is based on historical human behaviors, either codifying them into market standards or erecting guardrails against their natural tendencies. To be sure, developments of the last weeks and years demonstrate that many of these policies and procedures are worth revisiting. Cryptocurrency markets have proven that there might be demand for 24/7 markets, at least in some asset classes. GameStop has shown that certain retail broker-dealers might need to be better capitalized to anticipate the kind of groundswell behavior we have seen this week.","['risk', 'problem', 'technology', 'stop', 'trading', 'carlson', 'markets', 'clearing', 'standards', 'market', 'financial', 'settlement', 'gamestop', 'jill']","Robinhood did not halt trading of GameStop to punish the insurgent mass of retail traders.

The big story for the week involves the Reddit-based trading community called WallStreetBets that has been causing equities to behave like cryptocurrencies – very volatile. WallStreetBets have wreaked chaos in traditional markets after pumping GameStop stock up by nearly 900% in five days to around $380. Hedge fund Melvin Capital Management suffered heavy losses by betting against video game retailer GameStop.

Does crypto fix this?

The digital yuan was front-and-center in yesterday’s CBDC survey by the BIS, better known as the bank for central banks. Researchers there said 20% of the global population will likely be using general purpose digital fiat in the next three years. What they didn’t say was the identity of the country with 18% of the global population…. China!

In the meantime, security researchers started paying attention to potential risks of the digital yuan for the users outside of China. The Center for New American Security issued a report on how the Chinese Communist Party might get access to the financial data of people worldwide including, potentially, Americans who will be using the Chinese system in the future.

Would you use something like that, and do you care about privacy of your transactions?

The cryptocurrency is pumping, perhaps not-too-coincidentally, as investing app Robinhood faces criticism for censoring stock and crypto trading in response to the Wall Street Bets saga.

With Robinhood taking heat, Coinbase is basking in the glow.

Coinbase’s popularity has climbed to its highest point since 2017, and it’s now the ninth-most downloaded application on Apple’s (AAPL) U.S. app store as well.

The centralized exchange is one of the oldest in the game and has historically been the U.S.’ go-to option for buying bitcoin (BTC) and its cohort of altcoins. Because buying on Coinbase is straightforward and it’s been around for so many market cycles, the service has strong brand recognition and network effects, making it a routine referral to newcomers looking to buy bitcoin.

As evidenced by the influx of new users, Coinbase is pretty popular. But a lot has changed since Bitcoin’s last market craze, and there are plenty of options for first-timers to buy their first bitcoin besides Coinbase, some of which offer lower fees to boot.

Bear in mind, all exchanges are susceptible to outages when volumes spike. None of these exchanges are necessarily any better than Coinbase. This is just a sampling of some alternative options.

US-based bitcoin-only brokers

Below are venues to buy bitcoin that are exclusive to the U.S. and which offer bitcoin buying and selling only. Their fees are comparable to or lower than Coinbase’s own and they generally have better uptime, even in times of high market volatility.

These platforms act as brokers, buying and selling bitcoin for their clients, instead of true exchanges where users can trade with each other.

Cash App

For U.S. users, Square’s (SQ) Cash App is probably the easiest and fastest place to buy bitcoin. You can hook up your bank account, which can take a few days to onboard, or use your debit card, which can be used to start buying bitcoin instantly.

Available on mobile and web, Cash App allows you to purchase up to $100,000 per week in bitcoin, as well as withdraw $2,000 every day and $5,000 each week.

Cash App also offers automatic recurring buys and has a debit card which gives holders bitcoin-back rewards. Purchasing fees vary from roughly 1%-3% depending on the order size (the larger the order, the cheaper the fee). Cash App does not tack on a fee to withdraw.

River Financial

U.S.-exclusive River Financial is a relatively new, bitcoin-only broker that focuses on bringing a full suite of bitcoin-related client services to their customers. It’s not as easy as downloading Cash App, but River’s financial suite offers a number of services that make it a standout among bitcoin exchanges.

River allows, for instance, Lightning Network deposits and withdrawals, which means you can deposit or take your bitcoin out of River instantly for zero (or near zero) network costs. You can also integrate your hardware wallet(s), which allows you to track the bitcoin you keep in cold storage on your River account. Like Cash App, you can set auto-recurring bitcoin buys.

River is built for larger purchases, as the minimum buy is $100, and it only allows for purchases using a U.S. bank account. River does not have a withdrawal fee and it charges anywhere from 1%-3% for buys, depending on size.

Swan Bitcoin

Swan Bitcoin is not your traditional bitcoin on ramp.

The bitcoin-only service has become popular among bitcoiners because it allows its users to set daily recurring auto-buys for as little as a dollar. Swan users can also designate a wallet for withdrawals. It’s designed for bitcoiners who want to set a daily or weekly average buy, and it offers some of (if not the) lowest fees for spot bitcoin purchases in the U.S.

Weekly purchases of $50 or more are subject to a 1.19% fee, unless the buyer prepays their fees through an annual savings plan, in which case fees are 0.99%. Swan does not charge withdrawal fees and only links to a bank account.

International Bitcoin Exchanges

Whether you are inside or outside the U.S., here are a few centralized exchanges that service an international clientele.

Each exchange featured below offers a mobile app (for Android and iOS) to manage your account on the go and allows fiat currency deposits through bank transfer or credit/debit cards. They also have Bitcoin’s Lightning Network enabled (or plan to do so in the near future), meaning clients can use this network to avoid high on-chain fees when withdrawing to self-custody.

Trading fees on these bitcoin exchange platforms are lower than those of Coinbase and other brokers, usually roughly 0.1%-0.5% per trade. But the experience of buying bitcoin may not be as easy for newcomers because these exchanges, which include loads of altcoins, are really set up as trading venues before anything else. Consequently, those unaccustomed to cryptocurrency exchange layouts may find them more challenging to navigate than other options.

Bitfinex

An international exchange that is one of the oldest in the industry, Bitfinex supports trading in U.S. dollars, euros, British pounds, Japanese yens, China’s yuan and all major stablecoins.

As a plus for power users, Bitfinex also offers deposits and withdrawals using Bitcoin’s Lightning Network and Blockstream’s Liquid sidechain.

Bitfinex’s withdrawal fees for bitcoin are static at 0.0004 BTC.

Kraken

Kraken is one of the oldest U.S.-based exchanges and offers both spot trading for bitcoin and altcoins as well as leveraged trading. The exchange supports deposits in USD, EUR, CAD, AUD, GBP, CHF, JPY and major stablecoins.

Withdrawal fees for bitcoin are set at 0.0005 BTC.

Kraken Exchange told CoinDesk at the end of 2020 that it plans to integrate the Bitcoin Lightning Network for deposits and withdrawals this year.

OKCoin

OKCoin is an international exchange that accepts USD, EUR and Singapore dollar (SGD) deposits and major stablecoins. The exchange is in the process of integrating the Lightning Network, which should go live in February.

As with other exchanges right now, OKCoin’s Bitcoin withdrawal fees are 0.0004 BTC.

Decentralized Bitcoin Exchanges

These bitcoin exchanges don’t require know-your-customer (KYC) identity verification and allow users to trade directly with each other without relinquishing their private keys to a third party (unlike the centralized exchanges explored above). Because you never relinquish your private keys to the exchange, no third party can freeze your funds on these services.

Non-KYC exchanges allow customers to buy bitcoin under the radar such that they don’t reveal sensitive personal information to a third party. As evidenced in the Ledger and BlockFi security breaches, not every hack ends in a loss of funds; exchanges and services that store KYC information are a honeypot for hackers, who sell stolen personal information like emails and physical addresses on the dark web.

You’ll jump through more hoops if you buy bitcoin this way and it will be more difficult than the typical route, but the bitcoin will be “more private” as a result (though this typically comes at a high premium cost).

Hodl Hodl

Hodl Hodl is a global, peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange that uses multisignature wallets to escrow trades between users.

The Hodl Hodl marketplace gives traders the option to support whichever payment method they want (Zelle, PayPal, bank wire, altcoins, SWIFT, credit cards and gift cards). Once payment for a trade is complete, either party signs their end of the multisig wallet to release funds. In the event that there’s a disagreement, Hodl Hodl’s team arbitrates.

Because Hodl Hodl doesn’t require KYC, bitcoin typically sells at a premium compared to other exchanges, anywhere from 5% up.

Trading fees are split between the buyer and seller, 0.3% of each trade.

Bisq

Like Hodl Hodl, Bisq is a peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange, but it’s not web-hosted.

Bisq is Bitcoin’s only self-hosted decentralized exchange. This means that each Bisq user must download the exchange’s software and run a Bisq node to trade on the service. A multisignature wallet is used to escrow trades.","['exchange', 'network', 'hodl', 'bitcoin', 'buying', 'exchanges', 'app', 'fees', 'ways', 'buy', 'users', 'coinbase']","When Elon Musk adds #Bitcoin to his Twitter bio, you know buying bitcoin is in vogue again.

This is what Bitcoin Core developer Andrew Chow is trying to find out in a new survey.

Sponsored by a grant from MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative, Chow crafted the survey “to get answers from people who are not current users” about why they don’t run a Bitcoin Core full node, the wallet software which simultaneously keeps a record of Bitcoin’s transaction history and connects users to other peers in the network.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

Bitcoin full nodes are like servers so, if you’re not running your own to broadcast transactions to the wider network, then you’re relying on someone else’s.

Moreover, a full node offers users complete control over what encoded rules they want to follow, as well as the ability to independently verify a variety of network data. The popular Bitcoin memes “One node, one vote” and “Run the numbers” demonstrate that these principles of self-verifiability and freedom of choice are core principles for Bitcoin’s most fervent followers.

In short, running a full node is the ultimate exercise in financial self-determination in the Bitcoin realm.

So that’s why Chow launched the survey, which runs until March 2, to give developers an “idea of the biggest barriers facing people who might want to run a node but currently do not.” The inspiration came from a conversation with fellow developers about the removal of a little-known wallet feature for Bitcoin Core.

“Several months ago, a few other Bitcoin Core developers and I were discussing the removal of a feature called zapwallettxes. The main question that we had was whether anyone actually used it. This basically led to the general sentiment of wishing to know how users actually use Bitcoin Core,” he told CoinDesk in a direct message.

Bitcoin Core usage survey

The survey’s first questions establish the basics: where are you from, how’d you find the survey, do you run a Bitcoin Core full node?

If the respondent replies that they do run a node, the survey follows up by asking if they use the Bitcoin Core wallet and if they ever have in the past. If you do run a node, the survey will continue to grill you over the specifics of your use: how often you update, what other software/hardware you use, why you run a node, etc.

If you don’t run a node, the survey asks you what wallet you use if you own bitcoin and what barriers have kept you from running a node, be they technical complexity or otherwise.

How many Bitcoin nodes are there?

Measuring the total number of active nodes on the Bitcoin network is tricky, because some nodes may choose to be open to connect to any other node (a “listening node”), while others may choose to keep their connections closed and private (a “non-listening node”)

Still, one of the more accurate metrics comes from prolific Bitcoin developer Luke Dash Jr., whose data estimates there are roughly 83,000 Bitcoin Core nodes currently active (and just over 1,100 or so of Bitcoin’s other few software versions).

This is long shy of the 200,000 Bitcoin nodes that were running back at the peak of 2017’s market cycle, according to the same data, but still more than the 40,000 or so that were operating in the aftermath of March 2020’s historic sell-off.

Better-than-expected response

So far, the survey has 600 recorded responses, which is more than Chow and his peers projected for the early stages of the survey, which will run for roughly five more weeks.

Chow said he plans to publish the data he collects once it’s fully analyzed, adding that “there are no plans to act on the results.” Bitcoin’s development is distributed, after all, so coordinating around specific changes for the diversity of users in the survey isn’t practical.","['wallet', 'nodes', 'core', 'bitcoin', 'node', 'run', 'survey', 'running', 'users', 'data']","“Are you running the numbers?”This is what Bitcoin Core developer Andrew Chow is trying to find out in a new survey.

Analysts point to the legendary social media habits of serial entrepreneur Elon Musk as a catalyst for bitcoin’s Friday price pop. “Elon’s ‘bitcoin’ logo added to his Twitter feed kicked us off on the aggressive move higher,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for Swissquote Bank. “His comments triggered huge buy stop losses on Binance and likely the other Asian exchanges as leveraged traders had to close their short positions.”

Indeed, total liquidations across the entire crypto market over the past 24 hours was the highest in three months, at over $850 million on the short side, according to aggregator Bybt. Liquidations are the crypto equivalent of a margin call: When a leverage trader’s position moves against price, it is bought or sold automatically to begin to wipe out any potential liability.

“The red pullback is absolutely natural given how much we have moved,” Swissquote’s Thomas added. “We’ll likely find a new base – perhaps with $35,000 support – and trade sideways to slightly higher, assuming no more news.”

Prior to the Musk motions, the crypto market had been in the doldrums. “Investors were focused on other big events like earnings and the [Federal Reserve],” noted David Russell, vice president of market intelligence for trading platform TradeStation. “They would have come back to crypto regardless because of the institutional adoption trend, but Musk lit a fire under their feet.”

Funding rates for long leverage are jumping to a level not seen since bitcoin’s record high Jan. 8, when the price hit $41,962, according to CoinDesk 20 data. It’s a sign traders are emboldened by the short liquidations to fuel up some long trades right now.

It will be interesting to see how bitcoin performs over the weekend because crypto never sleeps. Major equities indexes on Friday are awash in red. Could traders jump on cryptocurrency markets to find weekend opportunities?

“This has been a tremendous week for retail trading across multiple asset classes,” noted James Putra, head of product strategy at Tradestation. “Since most other asset classes are closed later today, we are excited to see if the 24/7 crypto markets benefit from the retail trading enthusiasm.”

DEX volumes hit $50 billion in January monthly volume

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Friday trading around $1,348 and climbing 0.81% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

Monthly decentralized exchange, or DEX, volumes for major projects in the Ethereum ecosystem have eclipsed $50 billion, according to data aggregator Dune Analytics.

In first place is long-standing bellwether Uniswap, with $23.3 billion for January so far, almost half of the total volume. Uniswap is followed by $10 billion by its smart contract fork rival SushipSwap and then $5.8 billion for stablecoin-focused exchange Curve. “I trade a lot on DEXs. They have deeper liquidity and less slippage than traditional exchanges,” noted Michael Gord, chief executive of trading firm Global Digital Assets.

However, Peter Chan, head trader at quantitative firm OneBit Quant, cautioned that centralized exchanges (CEX) still rule despite the record volumes on DEXs. “This is remarkable and I am happy for the development of DeFi,” Chan told CoinDesk, referring to decentralized finance. “But it’s still a long way to go compared to volumes on a CEX.”

According to CoinGecko, volume the past 24 hours on centralized exchange Binance was $34 billion as of press time.

Chan noted that DEX fees can also be staggering. “Gas price is still going to be a major problem for DEXs. Especially for small trades, gas fees could take up to 20%-30% of the trade.”

1. Elon Musk changed his Twitter bio to #bitcoin and the crypto jumped 20%, to highs last seen on Jan. 19. The two events are not definitely connected. However, just 15 minutes after Musk made the change, bitcoin climbed 15.7% to $37,050. It’s still ticking up.

Of course, with any rally, celebrity-driven or not, the question comes to stability. Blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant’s “Exchange Whale Ratio” found that exchange inflows among major bitcoin holders is at an eight-month high, signaling a possible price drop.

However, “Elon’s tweet overrides all other bearish signals,” Ki-Young Ju, CEO of blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, tweeted. In a follow-up tweet, Musk appears to nod to bitcoin, saying “In retrospect, it was inevitable,” a quote later imbedded into the cryptocurrency’s blockchain by mining pool F2Pool.

The sharp rise to a 10-day high of $38,020 sparked $387 million worth of bitcoin short liquidations on major exchanges including Binance, Bitfinex, BitMEX, ByBit, Deribit, FTX, HuobiDM and OKEx.

Musk has frequently shown support for crypto broadly. Industry publication Protos found nearly every time he mentions a cryptocurrency, it rallies.

DOGE was the most talked about cryptocurrency on Twitter, including a cryptic picture of a dog in a sweater posing on the cover of a magazine, which Musk posted in the midst of a market rally. (The symbol of dogecoin is a Shiba Inu while the featured dog in Musk’s tweet appears to be an Italian Greyhound.)

Dogecoin climbed 800% Thursday to a record high of about $0.082 per coin. At one point, the meme coin entered the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap.

2. In another story about meme-driven market mayhem, Robinhood has limited cryptocurrency buying due to “extraordinary market conditions.” Traders can “still use settled funds to buy crypto,” a spokesperson said.

This is the second day in a row that Robinhood trading functionality hit up against the limits of memetic demand. Yesterday, a near-revolution formed after the popular trading app placed limits on stocks favored by the Reddit day-trading community WallStreetBets .

. In what is shaping up to be the biggest trade of the century, a loosely organized group of retail traders attempted to put the squeeze on short-selling hedge funds. It started with GameStop, but spread to other company stocks with less than ideal prospects, like Kodak and AMC. And the mobbed moved markets, even raising questions of whether it was “manipulation.”

Just as the “degenerate traders,” a term often used sympathetically in Discord cesspools and on Reddit, the “man” looked to put its foot down. Lines of communication were cut (sorta) and Robinhood and Webull, the very disruptors that – per their own adverts – were democratizing finance, limited trading in a move that benefited short sellers.

Both the U.S. House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee announced there would be hearings on short-selling and online trading platforms. Traders filed lawsuits.

announced there would be hearings on short-selling and online trading platforms. Traders filed lawsuits. The moment has drawn comparisons to Occupy Wall Street, an anarchic protest movement that brought economic inequality to light.

Amid swirling rumors of collusion and political grandstanding, Robinhood said yesterday the pause on trading has been misunderstood. CEO Vlad Tenev said the company wasn’t “directed by a market maker or any other market participant, to pause stocks that had seen triple-digit returns, but made the decision based on a “technical and operational” considerations.

Turns out, the financial system’s physical and digital plumbing has capacity limits. Of course there have been calls to decentralize. Cryptocurrency company FTX has already listed a WallStreetBets (WSB) index, which will be mirrored on Blockfolio, capitalizing on the whole mess.

3. Coinbase is about 3.5 times the size of Robinhood, which is definitely notable and also a lame way to segue into news that the massive exchange intends to go public through a direct listing.

Yesterday, the firm confirmed rumors of an IPO through direct listing. Though the official documentation filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is not yet available. The firm's announcement Thursday included no details on when the stock would be listed or under which ticker.

is not yet available. The firm's announcement Thursday included no details on when the stock would be listed or under which ticker. In semi-related news, MicroStrategy (MSTR) CEO Michael Saylor said the firm will “explore various approaches” to continue buying bitcoin. The company holds 70,784 BTC, and has previously used Coinbase as a means to buy.

At stake

Decentralization blooms?

The retail-driven rally across several “meme stocks” has become a narrative opportunity for calls to “decentralize.” Painting with broad strokes, crypto influencers have viewed the week’s events as the power of the masses rising up against centralized gatekeepers and legacy institutions.

Connecting the dots to the crypto industry, noted technologist Balaji Srinivasan said, “Crypto and WallStreetBets have the same spirit: a vision of truly free markets where everyone plays by the same rules.” A disparate group of traders, banned together by social networks like Reddit and Discord, now, conceivably, can have as much influence on markets as Wall Street, Srinivasan argued.

The movement is much bigger than what’s happening with a few stocks. Similar references to decentralization were made after social media giants, including Twitter and Facebook, took the unprecedented step to ban now-former President Donald Trump from their platforms while he was still in office.

In short, the battle lines are being drawn around private companies – which were once seen as democratizing forces but have trended towards “illiberalism” – versus open-source platforms that anyone can use, indisputably and in perpetuity.

The problem isn’t necessarily about companies curating their platforms, like Robinhood temporarily limiting trading of a few overheated stocks or Twitter removing QAnon conspiracies, which, as we’ve covered before, is a First Amendment right, but about who gets to make the call.

The internet was envisioned as an open platform. It still is. But the World Wide Web we have today, the actual system that is so often conflated with the internet itself, is primarily mediated by a few tech giants. These companies – Google, Facebook and other household names – have become the interface people see when they log on. Their dark-house algorithms also surface the majority of content that is consumed online.

Decentralizing this stack, removing the “walled gardens,” is the work of the crypto movement, which is rapidly advancing towards Web 3.0, envisioned as a user-owned network. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is perhaps the highest-profile proponent of creating open protocols for social media.

A project he announced in late 2019, Blue Sky, recently released a report on the current state of the decentralized web. The obvious conclusion: There is much work to be done. One effort not covered in the Blue Sky report is a pretty clear example of this.

Revolution Populi announced the launch of its testnet today. It’s a blockchain-based solution meant “to decolonize the internet.” Developed by Yale computer science professor David Gelernter, sometimes credited as the creator of the first internet social network, and ex-Goldman Sachs Vice President Rob Rosenthal, Revolution Populi hopes to create an open source foundation where “a thousand social nets can bloom.”

It’s an ambitious goal, and one that faces numerous obstacles. When pitching itself as a “Facebook killer,” its founders told Forbes in 2019 it was eyeing a “billion-dollar” initial coin offering. That offering has yet to materialize, caught up in legal questions, Rosenthal said in an interview with CoinDesk’s Blockchain Bites yesterday.

Though Rosenthal said the project is “well capitalized” through private funding, there are other concerns. As experimental as experimental gets, the project is using a consensus algorithm, called random Delegated Proof Of Stake, which builds on the standard used in the EOS blockchain. Then there’s the project’s crypto clearinghouse to match trades.

“The cryptocurrency industry is screaming – screaming – for some measure of backstop against the spiraling crisis of counterparty risk,” Rosenthal said. It’s an infrastructure Rosenthal proposed as a way to monetize the system, though it is still being built. There are a few examples of clearinghouses already being used, like ErisX.

And as Messari notes, a blockchain already functions like a clearinghouse. “The Ethereum blockchain acts as the decentralized clearinghouse for transactions involving tokens and smart contracts. Ethereum currently settles billions in transactions every day without requiring a corporation like the [Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation] to ensure a transaction is completed.”

That said, crypto is inherently forward-looking and foundational technology across the ecosystem is still being laid out. Just weeks ago, for instance, Revolution Populi integrated with the decentralized app friendly Matic Network.

In some sense, what matters most in crypto is intention. The core idea being is to empower individuals, to flatten hierarchies and to lay a technological foundation that could never be co-opted by governments or corporations.

I was curious about Rosenthal’s take on the Robinhood dilemma, given his 19-year career at one of the world’s most powerful investment banks, one that Matt Tiabbi referred to as “a great vampire squid.” If RevPop wants to kill Facebook, what’s next for Goldman?

There will be no bloodshed, the gray-haired former punk rocker said diplomatically.

“The point is, we’re on the right side of history, which is a populist revolution. It’s a philosophy of decentralization, an idea around people controlling their own lives,” he said.

Whether it’s an alternative worth considering, I leave to you, dear reader, to decide.

In a Friday filing, Ripple Labs pushed back against the SEC’s allegations, which claim the San Francisco-based firm violated U.S. securities laws for over seven years by selling $1.3 billion worth of XRP tokens.

“The functionality and liquidity of XRP are wholly incompatible with securities regulation. To require XRP’s registration as a security is to impair its main utility,” the response said.

In a 93-page filing, Ripple responded to each of the SEC’s paragraphs. In its affirmative defenses, Ripple stated that XRP is not a security or investment contract, and the firm’s sales or distributions of XRP are likewise not investment contracts.

Ripple rebuttal

The SEC sued Ripple in December 2020, alleging the company, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chairman Chris Larsen sold over $1 billion in XRP, promoted the token and paid third parties to support the cryptocurrency.

Parts of Ripple’s response seem to focus on what XRP actually does, in the company’s view, saying the SEC complaint ignored that XRP is open source and claiming that its price has correlated with the price of bitcoin and ether.

“The Complaint mischaracterizes advice that Ripple received in 2012, from which a reasonable reader actually would have concluded that Ripple Credits (a past name for XRP) were not a security,” the filing adds a few paragraphs down.

Ripple is also claiming that the SEC did not provide fair notice that its sales of XRP might be violating the law.

It pointed to its settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network in 2015, which registered XRP as a convertible virtual currency and allowed for sales and secondary market transactions.

“Upon information and belief, Plaintiff knew of that 2015 settlement and yet, for years after, Plaintiff provided Defendants with no clear notice that, in Plaintiff’s view, Defendants’ prospective XRP sales as permitted by the agreement would nevertheless constitute a violation of another federal law,” the response said.

Commodity clarity

In addition to filing its response, Ripple filed a Freedom of Information Act request for documents from the SEC on how it determined that bitcoin and ether, the top two cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, are not securities.

“To date, they have offered no guidance for that determination, hindering responsible players like Ripple from being able to innovate in the U.S. to bring faster, cheaper and more transparent global payments to consumers who need them the most. As we have said for many years, we’re simply asking for the rules to be clearly stated and applied consistently,” a spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

[],,https://static.coindesk.com/static/chunks/images/facebook-cd851abcf9cbd3f39aaafc2c0a54009d.png,"In order to mine Ethereum, you need specialized computers that can perform the computations necessary to create new tokens on the blockchain in a timely manner as well as a significant amount of electricity, which is required to run the equipment continuously. All of this adds up to significant upfront costs.

Mining is the “glue” that holds together many cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, by ensuring that the network comes to consensus on each and every change made in the system. Ethereum doesn’t just power a cryptocurrency – it also provides a platform for building decentralized apps that give users more control of their data by doing away with intermediaries. Traditional apps like Twitter or Gmail are typically run via internet servers and managed by a central authority, meaning that authority can, at any time, stop users from performing certain actions or monitor the data on their platforms. Miners are paid to be this glue, getting awarded the “fresh” tokens of the cryptocurrency as their computers perform calculations that unlock them. That’s why most people take up the venture in the first place.

Miners set computers loose to grind through cryptographic computations in an attempt to win ether, Ethereum’s native token. They need to try a huge number of computational problems until one unlocks a new batch of the asset.

In theory, anyone can set their computers to focus on these cryptographic puzzles as a way to win rewards. The catch is that mining on major public blockchains tends to require more and more power over time. As more people invest in more powerful hardware to mine cryptocurrency, the calculations get harder. Miners using regular computers are very, very unlikely to win.

Choosing mining hardware

Before getting started, you will need special computer hardware to dedicate full-time to mining.

There are three types of mining hardware:

CPUs

GPUs: Faster than CPUs

ASICs: Even faster and more powerful than GPUs

GPUs and ASICs boast a higher hashrate, meaning they can guess puzzle answers more quickly. At time of writing, GPUs and ASICs are now the only cost-effective option for ether miners. CPUs aren’t powerful enough anymore.

Settling up a GPU is a complex task and you can browse plenty of advice about which ones are the most profitable based on how many hashes the GPU can compute per second, power consumption and the initial expense of the card.

You probably want to set up a mining rig, a machine that might be composed of multiple GPUs and can take a week to build.Online mining profitability calculators, such as the one offered by Etherscan, give some insight into the likely amount of ether you’ll earn at a given hashrate, and whether that ether is enough – when cutting out the costs of setup and electricity – to make a profit.

Installing Ethereum software

After selecting some mining hardware, the next step is to install the mining software.

Miners need to install an Ethereum client to connect to the wider Ethereum network. An internet connection is vital for miners. Without an internet connection, the node won’t be able to do much of anything.

Programmers familiar with the command line can install Geth, software that runs an Ethereum node written in the scripting language Go, or any of the other Ethereum clients, like Parity or OpenEthereum.

Download Geth here, using the directions for your appropriate operating system (Windows, Mac OS, or Linux), unzip it, and run it.

Once installed, your node can then connect to the Ethereum network where it can then “talk” to other nodes, to catch wind of the latest transactions and blocks. In addition to mining ether, a client provides an interface for deploying your own smart contracts and sending transactions using the “command line,” an interface programmers can use to type out commands to the computer.

Install Ethereum mining software

Aspiring miners then need to install the official mining software, Ethminer.

Find the download for the appropriate version of Windows here, or GPU mining instructions for other operating systems here.

Once installed, your node will officially play a part in securing the Ethereum network. For more detailed instructions on any of the above, visit the official ethereum website.

Joining a mining pool

As a miner, you’re unlikely to be able to mine ether on your own.

That’s why miners “pool” together their computational power into “mining pools,” to improve their chances of solving the cryptographic puzzles and earning ether. Then, they split the profits proportional to how much power each miner contributed.

There are many factors involved in joining a mining pool. Each pool might not be around forever, and the computational power of each pool is constantly changing, so there are a number of factors that go into deciding which to join.

One point to keep in mind is that mining pools have different payout structures. And pools charge mining fees.

Today the most popular mining pools are:

Ethermine

F2Pool

Mining pools generally have a signup process on their website so miners can connect to the pool and begin mining.

Find cheap electricity

The other biggest mining cost is electricity. Many profitable miners scout for electricity discounts, either by moving to regions around the world with less expensive electricity or by tapping renewable energy sources.

Ethereum Mining FAQs

Is Ethereum mining profitable?

The answer is complex. There are many variables miners need to consider when taking the plunge into mining, such as how much ether is worth at a given time and cost of electricity, an expensive necessity for mining. The cost of electricity varies across the globe.

How could the Ethereum upgrade ‘ProgPoW’ impact mining?

ProgPoW is a proposed Ethereum upgrade that, if implemented, would hamstring the most powerful miners. The motive for doing so is to keep the network decentralized by trying to ensure that no one in the network gets too much power.

In short, miners using ASICs (hardware even more powerful for mining than GPUs – see above) are the ones that would be affected. Their ASICs, which miners likely paid a premium for, would no longer be able to be used to mine ether.

How will Ethereum 2.0 upgrade impact mining?

The upgrade Ethereum 2.0 started roll out on Dec. 1, 2020, and will be iterated upon over the next several years.

The upgrade will impact mining even more drastically than ProgPoW. Once Ethereum 2.0 is fully rolled out, the goal is to eradicate miners completely, paving the way for a more energy-efficient method of maintaining the integrity of the Ethereum blockchain.

How do I keep abreast of Ethereum events that could impact mining?

The mining world is a whirlwind of change. The tools that you pick up today might be obsolete next year. Some mining pools might fall away while others emerge.

As a miner it’s worth keeping aware of industry shifts by keeping tabs on the latest mining news as well as Ethereum protocol upgrades.","['power', 'mining', 'need', 'network', 'upgrade', '101', 'pools', 'ethereum', 'ether', 'electricity', 'miners']","Miners need to install an Ethereum client to connect to the wider Ethereum network.

Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao – who earned the number-one spot on CoinDesk’s 2018 Most Influential list – Binance rose to prominence during the historic crypto market-wide bull run in 2017 by supporting a wide array of cryptocurrencies in what was, and perhaps still is, one of the fastest and most reliable trading platforms.

In fact, Binance became so popular, so quickly that CZ and Binance both became worth more than $1 billion in less than one year, officially making it one of the first companies to achieve “unicorn” status in the cryptocurrency industry.

Yet despite its reputation as a destination for crypto traders, it’s not exactly easy for users who lack a traditional trading or investment background to navigate their way around.

In this piece, we take a step-by-step look at how to use Binance and conduct a trade on the exchange.

Signing up

First thing’s first, you’ll need to create an account. Anyone is able to sign up since Binance does not require customer information, but by doing so “you acknowledge and declare that you are not on any trade or economic sanctions lists” as per its Terms of Use.

This includes citizens of the member countries in the UN Security Council Sanctions list, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC), among other groups.

The terms also state each user must be at least 18 years of age. Binance reserves the right to cancel or freeze any account If the terms are disobeyed.

If the restrictions do not apply to you, to sign up simply navigate to the homepage and click register.

You will then be asked to enter a minimal amount of personal information such as your email address, password, and a referral ID if you have one.

As per Binance’s referral system, you will receive 50 percent of your referrals trading fees.

After you fill in the required fields, click “Register” and complete the captcha, a confirmation link will be sent to your email address.

Once the link is clicked, your Binance account is ready to be used.

Deposit Funds

Now that your account is activated, but before exploring the rest of the exchange, you’ll need to add funds to your account if you wish to buy or sell any cryptocurrencies.

Pay with credit card

Binance has a feature that allows users to purchase certain cryptocurrencies directly with their Visa or Mastercard credit card. If you are a qualified candidate, navigate to the “Funds” tab and select “Buy With Credit Card.”

You will then be required to enter the purchase amount of the desired cryptocurrency and whether you will be paying with the US dollar or euro. Cryptocurrency purchases by credit card are limited to BTC, ETH, and LTC at this time.

There is a minimum processing fee of $10 or 3.5 percent of the total order – whichever is more expensive. After completing this step, you will need to confirm your billing information, email address as well as your identity.

A valid government issued form of ID is required to be submitted to confirm your identity.

Once all of the required steps have been completed, the newly purchased cryptocurrency should reach your Binance wallet within 10-30 minutes.

Deposit from wallet

You can also make a deposit by sending funds from a separate cryptocurrency wallet into your Binance account.

In order to do this, navigate to the “Funds” tab once again and click “Balances.”

On this page, you will see all of the cryptocurrencies available for trading on Binance. To deposit the corresponding crypto into any of these, simply click the “Deposit” button next to the crypto asset of your choice.

Next, either scan the QR code from your cryptocurrency wallet or paste in the address and then send.

Once that’s complete, wait for the transaction to process and you’ll be ready for trading.

Placing a trade

Let’s go back to the home page now that your funds are ready to be used.

Here, you will again see all the cryptocurrencies that are tradable on Binance and their respective markets.

For this example, let’s say you previously deposited 0.0024 BTC (~$10) into your account and now wish to trade it for NEO.

First, you’ll need to find the right NEO market.

Since you want to spend BTC in order to get NEO, click the “BTC Markets” tab and then type NEO into the search bar.

Click the appropriate row and the page where trading takes place will open.

Trading module

This page may look intimidating, but you can easily get the hang of it with a bit of practice.

Plus, most cryptocurrency exchanges have a similar trading interface so what you remember here, in all likelihood, will be relevant elsewhere.

The left section of the screen is known as an order book.

Here, you will see all active buy and sell limit orders. A limit order is simply an order that will only be placed at the user’s desired price, given there are buyers or sellers interested at that level.

If you would like to learn the “in’s and out’s” of an order book, check out our comprehensive guide, but for now all you need to know is that the top of the order book (red) is where the limit sell orders wait to be filled and the bottom section (green) is where the limit buy orders wait to be filled.

The right side of the page is more simple – the above section shows the other cryptocurrencies that can be traded and the lower section shows the public trade history of the market currently being viewed.

Trade example: Buying NEO

The center of the page is where the real magic happens.

Here lays a chart feature that shows real-time price action and technical analysis indicators. Just below the chart is where you will actually execute the trade, so let’s buy some NEO.

If certainty of execution is your priority, select market order. If you are interested in only buying at a specific price level, select either limit or stop-limit order.

For the purposes of this example, let’s place a market order, which will be placed immediately at current market prices.

Now, just enter the amount of BTC desired to be spent and how much NEO you want to purchase. Binance has a useful shortcut for entering the purchase amount and it is based on a percentage of your bitcoin balance (or any other appropriate trading pair).

Let’s spend 50 percent of the BTC balance so there is some left over, perhaps for another trade.

The last step is to click the big green button “Buy NEO.” Since this is a market order, the trade for 0.58 NEO should have completed instantly, but that is most likely not the case if you selected limit or stop-limit order.

To check on the status of your order, look towards the bottom of the page where it says “Open order.” As the title would suggest, if your order has not yet executed, in other words, is still “open,” it will appear in this box until it has either been canceled or filled.

When it has been filled, it will show up in the lower box highlighting your 24-hour order history, just as how this order has below.

In order to sell, simply follow this same process but execute a market or limit sell order.

Withdrawing funds

While Binance does have a decentralized exchange in the works, the existing platform is centralized and susceptible to hacks like many other websites, so it’s recommended funds are only held on the exchange for as long as necessary.

In order to withdraw, navigate back to the “Balances” page. If you would like to see only the cryptocurrencies you have a substantial balance in, check the “hide” box.

Now select the withdrawal button in the NEO row and have your destination address or QR code handy. Paste the address and select how much you want to withdraw.

Last but not least, click submit and wait for the transaction to complete.

Binance Launchpad

The Binance Launchpad is a token launch platform exclusive to Binance and plans to offer token sales for new projects.

Binance handpicks which tokens to launch based on a number of factors including project maturity, scalability and adoption readiness, team quality and the ability of the project to benefit the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

To ensure the sales are being conducted in compliance with regulatory regimes around the world, each user must verify his or her Binance account.

Completed token sales, as well as those scheduled for a future date, can be seen on the home page of the Binance Launchpad. It’s worth noting that the token sales operate on a “first come, first serve” basis and usually sell out in just minutes, so be sure to do your due diligence.

If you successfully participate in a Launchpad token sale, the tokens will be automatically credited to your Binance account.

Security

Like most modern cryptocurrency exchanges, two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled on Binance and is highly recommended to be set up in order to add an extra layer of protection to your account.

In order to do so, navigate to your account summary by clicking the user avatar in the top right of the home page.

Once directed to your account page, a prompt will likely appear suggesting you to enable 2FA, which happens to automatically pops up when a new user accesses this page.

Binance allows two methods for enabling 2FA, via SMS or Google Authenticator.

With the SMS version, simply enter your mobile phone number and the verification code sent to the corresponding phone and you will be all set.

If Google Authenticator is your 2FA of choice, download the mobile application, open it and scan the QR code provided by Binance. Next, you will be asked to write down a 16-word recovery phrase to be used as a backup in case you lose access to this google authentication.

Lastly, you will be prompted to enter your account’s login password and the authenticator code found in the Google Authenticator mobile app. Once complete, this form of 2FA security will be complete.

Pros and Cons

Pros

If you're constantly on the go, Binance’s mobile application may be perfect for you. It's compatible with iOS, Android, as well as Mac and PC operating systems so just about anyone can place a trade or monitor their account from virtually anywhere.

Binance offers a large selection of tradeable cryptocurrency markets. As of May 1, 2019, 467 different markets are supported on the exchange.

Cons

If following government regulations like that of the US is important to you, then you may want to try out exchanges such As Coinbase or Gemini, because at this point Binance is still an unregulated exchange.

Many of Binance’s markets, specifically those of the lesser known altcoins, offer low liquidity which can make trading large altcoin positions difficult.

In order to sell, simply follow this same process but execute a market or limit sell order.

Withdrawing funds

While Binance does have a decentralized exchange in the works, the existing platform is centralized and susceptible to hacks like many other websites, so it’s recommended funds are only held on the exchange for as long as necessary.

In order to withdraw, navigate back to the “Balances” page. If you would like to see only the cryptocurrencies you have a substantial balance in, check the “hide” box.

Now select the withdrawal button in the NEO row and have your destination address or QR code handy. Paste the address and select how much you want to withdraw.

Last but not least, click submit and wait for the transaction to complete.

Binance Launchpad

The Binance Launchpad is a token launch platform exclusive to Binance and plans to offer token sales for new projects.

Binance handpicks which tokens to launch based on a number of factors including project maturity, scalability and adoption readiness, team quality and the ability of the project to benefit the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

To ensure the sales are being conducted in compliance with regulatory regimes around the world, each user must verify his or her Binance account.

Completed token sales, as well as those scheduled for a future date, can be seen on the home page of the Binance Launchpad. It’s worth noting that the token sales operate on a “first come, first serve” basis and usually sell out in just minutes, so be sure to do your due diligence.

If you successfully participate in a Launchpad token sale, the tokens will be automatically credited to your Binance account.

Security

Like most modern cryptocurrency exchanges, two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled on Binance and is highly recommended to be set up in order to add an extra layer of protection to your account.

In order to do so, navigate to your account summary by clicking the user avatar in the top right of the home page.

Once directed to your account page, a prompt will likely appear suggesting you to enable 2FA, which happens to automatically pops up when a new user accesses this page.

Binance allows two methods for enabling 2FA, via SMS or Google Authenticator.

With the SMS version, simply enter your mobile phone number and the verification code sent to the corresponding phone and you will be all set.

If Google Authenticator is your 2FA of choice, download the mobile application, open it and scan the QR code provided by Binance. Next, you will be asked to write down a 16-word recovery phrase to be used as a backup in case you lose access to this google authentication.

Lastly, you will be prompted to enter your account’s login password and the authenticator code found in the Google Authenticator mobile app. Once complete, this form of 2FA security will be complete.

Pros and Cons

Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao – who earned the number-one spot on CoinDesk’s 2018 Most Influential list – Binance rose to prominence during the historic crypto market-wide bull run in 2017 by supporting a wide array of cryptocurrencies in what was, and perhaps still is, one of the fastest and most reliable trading platforms.

In fact, Binance became so popular, so quickly that CZ and Binance both became worth more than $1 billion in less than one year, officially making it one of the first companies to achieve “unicorn” status in the cryptocurrency industry.

Yet despite its reputation as a destination for crypto traders, it’s not exactly easy for users who lack a traditional trading or investment background to navigate their way around.

In this piece, we take a step-by-step look at how to use Binance and conduct a trade on the exchange.

Signing up

First thing’s first, you’ll need to create an account. Anyone is able to sign up since Binance does not require customer information, but by doing so “you acknowledge and declare that you are not on any trade or economic sanctions lists” as per its Terms of Use.

This includes citizens of the member countries in the UN Security Council Sanctions list, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC), among other groups.

The terms also state each user must be at least 18 years of age. Binance reserves the right to cancel or freeze any account If the terms are disobeyed.

If the restrictions do not apply to you, to sign up simply navigate to the homepage and click register.

You will then be asked to enter a minimal amount of personal information such as your email address, password, and a referral ID if you have one.

As per Binance’s referral system, you will receive 50 percent of your referrals trading fees.

After you fill in the required fields, click “Register” and complete the captcha, a confirmation link will be sent to your email address.

Once the link is clicked, your Binance account is ready to be used.

Deposit Funds

Now that your account is activated, but before exploring the rest of the exchange, you’ll need to add funds to your account if you wish to buy or sell any cryptocurrencies.

Pay with credit card

Binance has a feature that allows users to purchase certain cryptocurrencies directly with their Visa or Mastercard credit card. If you are a qualified candidate, navigate to the “Funds” tab and select “Buy With Credit Card.”

You will then be required to enter the purchase amount of the desired cryptocurrency and whether you will be paying with the US dollar or euro. Cryptocurrency purchases by credit card are limited to BTC, ETH, and LTC at this time.

There is a minimum processing fee of $10 or 3.5 percent of the total order – whichever is more expensive. After completing this step, you will need to confirm your billing information, email address as well as your identity.

A valid government issued form of ID is required to be submitted to confirm your identity.

Once all of the required steps have been completed, the newly purchased cryptocurrency should reach your Binance wallet within 10-30 minutes.

Deposit from wallet

You can also make a deposit by sending funds from a separate cryptocurrency wallet into your Binance account.

In order to do this, navigate to the “Funds” tab once again and click “Balances.”

On this page, you will see all of the cryptocurrencies available for trading on Binance. To deposit the corresponding crypto into any of these, simply click the “Deposit” button next to the crypto asset of your choice.

Next, either scan the QR code from your cryptocurrency wallet or paste in the address and then send.

Once that’s complete, wait for the transaction to process and you’ll be ready for trading.

Placing a trade

Let’s go back to the home page now that your funds are ready to be used.

Here, you will again see all the cryptocurrencies that are tradable on Binance and their respective markets.

For this example, let’s say you previously deposited 0.0024 BTC (~$10) into your account and now wish to trade it for NEO.

First, you’ll need to find the right NEO market.

Since you want to spend BTC in order to get NEO, click the “BTC Markets” tab and then type NEO into the search bar.

Click the appropriate row and the page where trading takes place will open.

Trading module

This page may look intimidating, but you can easily get the hang of it with a bit of practice.

Plus, most cryptocurrency exchanges have a similar trading interface so what you remember here, in all likelihood, will be relevant elsewhere.

The left section of the screen is known as an order book.

Here, you will see all active buy and sell limit orders. A limit order is simply an order that will only be placed at the user’s desired price, given there are buyers or sellers interested at that level.

If you would like to learn the “in’s and out’s” of an order book, check out our comprehensive guide, but for now all you need to know is that the top of the order book (red) is where the limit sell orders wait to be filled and the bottom section (green) is where the limit buy orders wait to be filled.

The right side of the page is more simple – the above section shows the other cryptocurrencies that can be traded and the lower section shows the public trade history of the market currently being viewed.

Trade example: Buying NEO

The center of the page is where the real magic happens.

Here lays a chart feature that shows real-time price action and technical analysis indicators. Just below the chart is where you will actually execute the trade, so let’s buy some NEO.

If certainty of execution is your priority, select market order. If you are interested in only buying at a specific price level, select either limit or stop-limit order.

For the purposes of this example, let’s place a market order, which will be placed immediately at current market prices.

Now, just enter the amount of BTC desired to be spent and how much NEO you want to purchase. Binance has a useful shortcut for entering the purchase amount and it is based on a percentage of your bitcoin balance (or any other appropriate trading pair).

Let’s spend 50 percent of the BTC balance so there is some left over, perhaps for another trade.

The last step is to click the big green button “Buy NEO.” Since this is a market order, the trade for 0.58 NEO should have completed instantly, but that is most likely not the case if you selected limit or stop-limit order.

To check on the status of your order, look towards the bottom of the page where it says “Open order.” As the title would suggest, if your order has not yet executed, in other words, is still “open,” it will appear in this box until it has either been canceled or filled.

When it has been filled, it will show up in the lower box highlighting your 24-hour order history, just as how this order has below.

(See screen grab below, in Omkar Godbole’s Bitcoin Watch column.)

The price of bitcoin, the oldest and largest cryptocurrency, surged 12% to about $37,400, around the highest in two weeks. According to Decrypt, the sudden surge higher caused some $420 million of trader positions to be liquidated – a delicious bit of irony given Musk’s very public aversion to short-sellers, or traders who bet on price declines.

Ether (ETH), the Ethereum blockchain’s native cryptocurrency, was also higher, pushing back toward a new all-time high price above $1,400.

Dogecoin (DOGE), a digital token with little utility beyond the meme-iness of its doggie-faced image, has climbed eight-fold in the past two days. (Read more about that here and here and in the Market Moves column, below.)

In traditional markets, European share indexes slid and U.S. stock futures pointed to a lower open amid lingering concerns about a cash squeeze in China and the volatile retail-trader speculation highlighted by this week’s GameStop saga.

Market Moves

A new narrative is coursing through digital markets that could soon make its way to the crypto industry’s marketing departments: That a lot of individual investors, furious at Wall Street and turned off by stock markets following the GameStop episode, might find redemption by turning to cryptocurrencies.

Crypto twitterati including Alex Kruger, Balaji Srinivasan, Erik Vorhees and the Winklevoss twins jumped on the bandwagon Thursday, hammering the message that Wall Street serves its own self-interests before those of customers. And that crypto fixes this.

The industry’s opportunistic spirit is already appearing in the form of pitches and new products. Non-U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange FTX, famous for last year’s TRUMP tokens, rushed to list GameStop’s stock for tokenized futures and spot trading, as reported by CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair. Bermuda-based Bittrex Global listed tokenized GameStop (GME) shares along with other stocks delisted by the retail trading platform Robinhood, including AMC Entertainment.

Here’s a quick sampling of the commentary:

Mati Greenspan , founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency analysis firm Quantum Economics, told his newsletter subscribers on Thursday: ""To many involved in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, the answer is very clear. Luckily for us, an alternative market has been under construction for the last few years, the decentralized marketplace. It's a place where transparency is enforced by code and not by men.""

Luckily for us, an alternative market has been under construction for the last few years, the decentralized marketplace. It's a place where transparency is enforced by code and not by men."" Paulo Ardoino , CTO of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and a spokesman for the stablecoin tether: ""As advocates for retail investors rail against the current structure and practices of financial markets, it is important to note that much of the work being done in the blockchain space has been inspired by these barriers. Removing obstacles to normal, everyday working people that are building and seeking wealth growing opportunities has always been part of the ethos of crypto.""

Camila Russo, founder of The Defiant newsletter: ""Decentralized finance will win. It's simply better. Freer.""

One big question, of course, is what it all might mean for cryptocurrency prices. Prices for the digital token dogecoin (DOGE), which is basically just a doggie-faced meme, have shot up in value as rumors swirled that it might be the next to draw the attention of buck-the-system (or even just fun-seeking) retail traders.

(For the DOGE-curious readers out ther, the breed typically associated with dogecoin is shina inu, which according to the American Kennel Club’s website typically only weighs about 20 pounds but is “a well-muscled,” “spirited,” and “good-natured.” Pretty cute, too!)

As discussed by First Mover on Thursday, there are already a lot of similarities between loosely regulated crypto markets, whose international reach has put large portions of the players and activity beyond the scope of usually-coordinated authorities, and the type of anything-goes, let’s-roll spirit that invaded Wall Street this week.

But it’s the mere existence of an alternative to the traditional financial system that might ultimately prove to be the biggest selling point for the crypto industry, which can also accurately claim to have the newest technology, broadly speaking.

Mohamed El-Erian, the former Pimco and Harvard money manager who now serves as chief economic adviser for the German financial conglomerate Allianz, wrote this week in a column for Bloomberg Opinion that the GameStop-inspired masses might represent a “new investor force” that “raises several interesting questions for market structure and future financial stability.”

“The dual possibility of large-scale financial volatility and market dysfunction would pose yet another challenge to an economic recovery,” El-Erian wrote.

That new investor force might represent the crypto-industry’s new hottest new lead – for motivated customers.

Bitcoin witnessed a sudden double-digit spike to 10-day highs on Friday.

The top cryptocurrency picked up a bid near $32,000 at around 08:30 coordinated universal time (3:30 a.m. in New York) and jumped to $37,050, the highest since Jan. 19, according to CoinDesk 20 data. The 15.7% rise happened in less than 15 minutes and more than reversed the early dip from $34,400 to $32,000.

While the exact reason for the bullish move is hard to define, prices surged after Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk changed his Twitter bio to mention the cryptocurrency. While the bitcoin community is keen for Musk to come out as a supporter, he seemingly enjoys dropping crypto mentions as something of a tease.

Around the time he changed the bio, Musk also cryptically tweeted: “In retrospect, it was inevitable.”

Whether bitcoin’s rise will continue isn’t certain. Blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant’s “Exchange Whale Ratio,” calculated by dividing the top 10 bitcoin inflow transactions in an hour by total exchange inflows, jumped to an eight-month high of 0.88 early Friday, warning of a possible price drop.

However, “Elon’s tweet overrides all other bearish signals,” Ki-Young Ju, CEO of blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant tweeted.

In a video interview on Thursday with Bloomberg’s Emily Chang, Vlad Tenev said the rumors were “categorically false” and Robinhood wasn’t “directed by a market maker or any other market participant,” but rather the decision was based on a “technical and operational” one.

“Robinhood, as a brokerage, has financial requirements including … deposits that we have to make to various clearinghouses. Some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets,” said Tenev.

In order to “protect the firm” and Robinhood’s customer base, Tenev said his platform disabled purchasing of 13 stocks associated with a Reddit trading group called WallStreetBets (WSB). Tenev added that buy orders for the 13 securities could resume as early as tomorrow.

The current flurry of trader activity has represented an “unprecedented market environment” over the past couple of weeks, according to the CEO. He said Robinhood had not disable selling of the stocks as it would have been “painful” to users of the platform if they weren’t allowed to exit their positions.

Share prices for businesses such as Nokia (NOK), AMC Entertainment (AMC) and GameStop (GME) rose to astronomical highs in recent weeks when WSB sought to “short squeeze” large U.S. institutional hedge funds looking to bet against those companies.

A number of retail traders have since exited their positions amid calls to hold with “diamond hands” – referring to a mindset of maintaining positions in an attempt to drive up stock prices. Despite the calls, AMC, GME and NOK’s share prices have fallen back over the last 24-hours, while lawsuits were filed against Robinhood.

“Concentrated investing” around these types of stocks was in high demand because of an “intersection” of social media and finance, the CEO said.

“I can kind of understand how Clorox and Lysol were feeling at the beginning of the dynamic when there was so much demand,” said Tenev referring to cleaning products indirectly touted by Donald Trump as a potential medical treatment to combat the rise of COVID-19.

When pressed by Chang over whether Tenev would be willing to visit Washington D.C. to testify about its actions, the CEO said he was open to having a conversation and that the current developments presented an “opportunity” to educate the public regarding how the mechanics of financial settlements in the market work.","['stock', 'surge', 'weeks', 'robinhood', 'amc', 'prices', 'trading', 'amid', 'limit', 'buying', 'market', 'forced', 'tenev', 'wsb', 'werent', 'redditdriven', 'ceo', 'stocks']","“Robinhood, as a brokerage, has financial requirements including … deposits that we have to make to various clearinghouses.

With the Stargate update to Cosmos on Feb. 18, the tools for native blockchain interoperability will be live on mainnet.

“This is a long-awaited release for many Cosmos-based projects out there,” Band Protocol’s Kevin Lu told CoinDesk via email. “For us this will enable seamless and simple integrations with any Cosmos-based decentralized application, relaying oracle data in a highly scalable and tamper-proof manner.”

Iqlusion’s Zaki Manian, who leads much of the development for Cosmos, explained that once Stargate goes live, a governance vote will be required to switch on inter-blockchain communication (IBC), which will take two weeks to finalize.

So at the earliest, all systems go for IBC would be early March. That said, Tendermint chains need to upgrade to the Cosmos SDK for this to happen. Manian said this is probably one or two weeks of work for most dev teams and they don’t need to wait for Stargate to kick in to start.

If Tendermint-based chains activate Stargate en masse, this has the potential to be a big moment – not just for Cosmos but in the whole history of crypto.

There have been a lot of standalone bridges between blockchains built so far, but Stargate could mark a new era in composability, where we see one big system that lets lots of different chains trade value and build on each other’s strengths.

Many chains

There are more notable Tendermint-based projects than many may realize.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

A new site called Cosmos-Cap is tracking the market capitalization of projects in the ecosystem, currently valuing all the chains together at just under $13 billion. The native token of Cosmos, ATOM, is currently trading around $8, with a market cap of $1.9 billion on its own.

While not on that list, the payments and remittances blockchain Celo has also taken steps to connect with Stargate.

THORChain, which enables assets to be swapped across chains (sort of like Uniswap), told CoinDesk, “THORChain is Stargate-ready, but more work needs to be done to make it IBC-ready, that is in the works currently.”

Other teams are also busy.

“The current plan for Band Protocol’s Stargate connection is to have testnet by Q1 and mainnet by Q2 for Stargate support,” Lu wrote, enabling the team time to be very confident in its implementation.

Do Kwon, a co-founder of Terraform Labs, which runs the Terra chain, confirmed it would upgrade but not until Stargate has had some time in the wild. “The earliest we would move to upgrade is May,” he wrote in an email.

Spokespeople for Celo and Oasis confirmed the teams are working toward IBC implementation, but without giving a timeline.

Binance, whose BNB coin represents the most value in the ecosystem, sent CoinDesk the following statement: “We will not be able to join the Stargate timeline to support the IBC. The Binance Chain community will discuss when and how to support this initiative.”

THORChain also emphasized that, like many big upgrades, Stargate will add other benefits for Tendermint-based blockchains, such as faster throughput and implementation of Google’s protocol buffers standard (which should also be good for interoperability).

Close followers of the project may have heard Stargate would launch on Jan. 28, but the date was pushed back. Manian told CoinDesk this decision was driven by a bug that was found and fixed. It was useful anyway because the exchanges still were not ready for the update.

Since 2019, the Cosmos project has been as volatile as cryptocurrency generally.

While in late 2019 CoinDesk noted the financial health of the project thanks to conservative treasury management, by early 2020 it appeared to be falling apart from a personnel standpoint. By the summer, however, it seemed Cosmos had weathered its internal storms.

Going forward, every time a blockchain clicks into IBC it is likely to put pressure on other Tendermint projects to get their upgrades done. With even a few interoperating, composability should start kicking in and FOMO will drive stragglers to get in fast.","['coindesk', 'projects', 'upgrade', 'interoperability', 'told', 'blockchain', 'set', 'cosmos', 'februarys', 'release', 'lead', 'tendermintbased', 'ibc', 'stargate', 'teams', 'chains']","With the Stargate update to Cosmos on Feb. 18, the tools for native blockchain interoperability will be live on mainnet.

An active Reddit-based trading community is causing more equities to behave like characteristically volatile cryptocurrencies amid an ongoing campaign of monstrous short squeezes. In response to abnormal market behavior, brokers and other financial service providers are threatening to cut off trading access to “limit risk.”

Self-described as “like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal,” the Wall Street Bets (WSB) trading community on Reddit wreaked chaos in traditional markets after pumping GameStop (GME) nearly 900% in five days to around $380 Wednesday morning. And the mayhem is spreading.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

Other heavily shorted stocks such as BlackBerry (BB) and AMC Entertainment (AMC) have seen triple-digit percentage gains in the past couple weeks as WSB traders set their sights on these companies. Even Eastman Kodak (KODK) shot up nearly 50% Wednesday, briefly trading near $14 after closing trading on Tuesday below $9.50.

Short selling is a bet that the price of GameStop stock will go down.

Other companies including Tootsie Roll (TR) and National Beverage Corp. (FIZZ) are also among the most-shorted stocks by hedge funds, per data from CNBC, making them possible WSB candidates in the future.

The long list of worries and problems this irregular market activity is causing includes inflicting heavy financial losses at hedge funds such as Melvin Capital, which held a large short position on GameStop. The fund finally capitulated and closed its position Tuesday after taking a “huge loss,” CNBC reported.

The Reddit trading community cheered. But trading services are reacting sternly to the chaos.

After tweeting about “unprecedented volumes” that “may be causing limited acess,” TD Ameritrade simply restricted client trading for GameStop, AMC and other securities “in the interest of mitigating risk for our company and clients.”

Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman told CNBC Thursday her firm actively monitors social media chatter and will halt stock trading if the content it sees matches with “unusual activity in stocks.”

Bloomberg reported that Wells Fargo also banned its advisers from making stock recommendations on GameStop and AMC Entertainment.

Government officials and regulators are also watching. The Biden Administration’s economic team is “monitoring the [GameStop] situation,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Wednesday afternoon. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also released a statement Wednesday evening saying it is “aware of and actively monitoring the on-going market volatility in the options and equities markets.”

Social media accounts used by members of the Reddit-spawned group have been shut down or limited. Discord banned the group’s server, ostensibly for hate speech, Wednesday evening, claiming that it has issued multiple warnings to the server admin “over the past few months,” per reporting by The Verge.

The group’s epicenter – r/wallstreetbets – was switched from public to invite-only around the same time, although a Reddit spokesperson told CoinDesk the company did not initiate the settings change. The group’s moderators did, the spokesperson said; the mods later confirmed this, and the subreddit was switched back to a public setting.

In the interim, a new public Wall Street Bets-branded subreddit was quickly spun up, and a self-described splinter group formed on the Telegram messaging service, highlighting the community’s determination to reorganize regardless of external pressure.

Cryptocurrency investors are capitalizing on the craziness to highlight a potentially universal use case for trading and financial services that cannot be limited or subject to similar crackdowns. Galaxy Digital (GLXY) CEO Mike Novogratz took to Twitter to say the WSB episodes are “a giant endorsement” of decentralized finance. But whether these rogue traders will show any interest in blockchain-based products remains an open question.

Interactive Brokers Chief Strategist Steve Sosnick called short sellers, in general, a “curious bunch” who profit through “courage and careful research.” But as the WSB saga continues, he warned, “many” could quickly “find themselves swamped.”

“No one can withstand […] an investor tsunami aimed at short sellers,” Sosnick said.","['tech', 'stock', 'big', 'trading', 'wsb', 'street', 'short', 'pumps', 'amc', 'told', 'clamp', 'monitoring', 'wall', 'situation', 'gamestop', 'biden', 'gamestopstyle', 'stocks']","Wall Street wants to stop stocks from trading like cryptocurrencies.

The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback’s value against major fiat currencies, is hovering near 90.40, representing a 0.3% gain.

The Fed Reserve is expected to leave the interest rate unchanged near zero and maintain its liquidity-boosting, bond-purchasing plan at around $120 billion/month. If so, the status-quo decision would be unlikely to elicit much of a reaction from the markets, bitcoin’s included.

However, stocks and bitcoin would drop and the dollar likely draw bids, if Fed Chairman Jerome Powell drops hints of a gradual unwinding of stimulus programs.

“BTC may face selling pressure if Powell signals an early taper,” Darius Sit, co-founder and managing partner at Singapore-based QCP Capital, told CoinDesk. Bitcoin, considered by many a hedge against monetary and fiscal imprudence, has moved largely in opposition to the dollar index since the March markets crash.

Some may anticipate an early exit from stimulus, given that market-based measures of long-term inflation expectations have recently risen above the Fed’s 2% target, while the U.S. and the global economy is now seen to be recovering at faster rate.

However, most observes, including QCP Capital’s Sit, don’t expect Powell to rock the boat. The Fed made it clear in August it intends to keep interest rates low for some time even after inflation climbs above 2%.

According to FXStreet’s Yohay Elam, Powell may indirectly signal a willingness to buy more bonds by calling for increased fiscal (government) spending, in which case inflation hedges like bitcoin and gold could shine.

U.S. President Joe Biden is pushing for a $1.9 trillion stimulus package, and the government needs to find funding for this extra debt, as noted by Elam.

Powell to curb over-exuberance?

The pandemic-era central bank stimulus has created exuberance across various asset classes, including bitcoin. In particular, stock markets are looking frothy, with some technology shares, such as GameStop, witnessing a retail frenzy.

As such, Powell may attempt to calm the markets. “Any hint that the Fed is unwilling to continue printing money in fear of bubbles would send [markets] down,” Elam noted.

Bitcoin is currently trading in a $30,000–$35,000 range established over the past four days, having dipped below $29,000 on Friday. Analysts foresee further sell-off on signs of weaker institutional demand.

After Elon Musk joined the fray, tweeting “GameStonks,” shares rose 50%. The video gaming stock is now worth $10 billion and classified as a large-cap stock, according to Bloomberg.

Scaramucci said in an interview with Bloomberg that this strong individual trader market action is “proof of concept that [b]itcoin is going to work,” and should be taken “seriously.”

He suggested the “decentralized” investor activity is similar to the fundamental concept behind bitcoin, while mobile-based and low-cost trading are “democratizing” formerly insular markets.

“How are you going to beat that decentralized crowd? That to me is more affirmation about decentralized finance,” Scaramucci said.","['stock', 'going', 'trading', 'decentralized', 'gaming', 'success', 'bitcoin', 'market', 'video', 'concept', 'gamestop', 'craze', 'investing', 'proof', 'scaramucci']","SkyBridge Capital’s Anthony Scaramucci said Wednesday that retail investor-led stock surges for video gaming firm GameStop suggest bitcoin will ultimately be a success.

There is not enough demand to absorb the additional coins on the market because institutions want an idea of how the new Biden Administration will view bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

At the press time, bitcoin was trading at $32,254.59, down 3.04% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk’s BPI. The price went as low as nearly $30,000 after markets opened in the U.S. on Tuesday.

Miners selling

Bitcoin miners’ position index, a ratio of the number of bitcoin leaving all miners’ wallets to that number’s one-year moving average, reached an eight-year high last week and is still above 2.0, according to data from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant. Any value above 2.0 indicates that most miners are selling.

Miners appear to have been selling in order to meet some of their operational costs.

“For the first time in a while, it appears miners sold some fairly substantial holdings to raise cash as we expected on a rally after October,” Neil Van Huis, director of sales and institutional trading at Blockfills, told CoinDesk. “With a need to allocate capital to more (and newer) mining rigs, taking bitcoin off of their balance sheet for cash at three or four times higher prices 30-60 days after the wet season ended in China was about the best scenario [miners] could’ve asked for.”

Not enough buyers

While miners continue selling bitcoin, it seems there aren’t enough buyers, especially from the institutional investors, to meet the sell side.

The “Coinbase premium,” the gap between Coinbase’s BTC/USD pair and Binance’s BTC/USDT pair involving the tether stablecoin, has not shown strong or consistent numbers above $50 after it went negative last week, according to data from CryptoQuant.

When this metric goes above $50, it usually indicates stronger spot buying pressure from Coinbase, CryptoQuant Chief Executive Ki Young Ju told CoinDesk. And when there are no USD spot inflows, the premium goes down.

Meanwhile, all stablecoins reserved on all exchanges hit a new all-time high on CryptoQuant’ tracker. This, coupled with no U.S. dollar spot inflows, means the current market is predominantly driven by crypto natives such as crypto hedge funds and market makers. Such market participants are more comfortable with buying and selling bitcoin with stablecoins, Ki said.

“If there’s no spot USD inflows, no more bull runs,” Ki added.

Institutions wait and see

Institutions are pressing the pause button on their bitcoin purchases partly because many are trying to get a read from the new Biden administration’s attitude towards crypto-related policies and regulations. Negative comments on cryptocurrencies from new Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen have raised some worries around possible added controls over the crypto markets.

Institutions “are still trying to gauge where this administration would be on crypto and if it won’t be too negative, meaning that the fear of aggressive regulations or flat-out bans would be lifted, then I think we would see a new wave of institutions coming into the space,” Guy Hirsch, U.S. managing director for multi-asset brokerage eToro, told CoinDesk.

Fear of the Wall Street Beats Redditors

Some retail traders are hoping what happened with GameStop Corp.’s volatile stock rally this week isn’t repeated with bitcoin. In GameStop’s case, “a band of Redditors and Discord users squeezed the life out of their GameStop shorts by quadrupling share prices,” Adam James, senior editor at OKEx Insights, the research arm of crypto exchange OKEx, said.

He added, “The realization that the legacy markets might not be what they used to be in the new stay-at-home paradigm [could] be affecting the bitcoin and cryptocurrency market, though I wouldn’t exactly say they are bearish for the crypto markets.”

That said, some traders and analysts have remained positive on the markets despite the short-term market volatility.

“With bitcoin being unable to reclaim [previous] highs, some are losing faith,” Bendik Norheim Schei, head of research at the Norwegian cryptocurrency analysis firm Arcane Research, told CoinDesk. “That is probably something they will regret later this year. Bitcoin is volatile, that’s part of the game with a new and emerging asset.”

Chris Thomas, head of digital asset at Swissquote, told CoinDesk his company saw a support level setting at around $30,000, a level previously received “decent” support from buyers.","['coindesk', 'sell', 'selling', 'trading', 'told', 'week', 'bitcoin', 'market', 'falls', 'yellen', 'spot', 'watch', 'institutions', 'miners', 'crypto']","Bitcoin’s price dropped as much as 10% during early trading hours on Tuesday as bitcoin miners started selling a large amount of the cryptocurrency for the first time since October.

According to two sources familiar with the situation, Harvard, Yale, Brown and the University of Michigan as well as several other colleges have been buying crypto directly on exchanges. (Several Ivy League endowments took an interest in blockchain technology via crypto-focused venture capital funds back in 2018.)

“There are quite a few,” said a source who asked to remain unnamed. “A lot of endowments are allocating a little bit to crypto at the moment.”

Yale and Brown did not respond to requests for comment by press time. When reached by CoinDesk, the Harvard and University of Michigan endowments declined to comment. Coinbase also declined to comment. University endowments got a single mention in Coinbase’s annual report for 2020, but without naming any names.

Some of the university endowment funds in question may have held accounts with Coinbase for as long as 18 months, according to one source.

“It could be since mid-2019,” the source said. “Most have been in at least a year. I would think they will probably discuss it publicly at some point this year. I suspect they would be sitting on some pretty nice chunks of return.”

University endowments are pools of capital accumulated by academic institutions, often in the form of charitable donations. These funds, which support teaching and research, can be allocated into various assets for investment purposes.

Harvard’s is the largest university endowment with over $40 billion in assets. Yale has over $30 billion, Michigan has about $12.5 billion, while Brown holds $4.7 billion. It is unknown how much each fund has allocated in crypto but it is likely a fraction of percent of their total assets.

Long road

Back in 2018, Yale University Chief Investment Officer David Swensen made headlines by backing two crypto-focused venture funds, one run by Andreessen Horowitz and another launched by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam and former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang.

Several other universities followed Yale in backing crypto VCs, including Harvard, Stanford, Dartmouth College, MIT, University of North Carolina and Michigan. Clearly, some of those schools appear to be taking the next step by investing directly in crypto assets.

The second source, who is involved in the crypto hedge fund world, pointed to “a big change” over the past few months. “We are seeing defined benefit pension plans getting close to making allocations. We are seeing public pension plans getting close to making allocations,” the person said.","['harvard', 'yale', 'funds', 'endowments', 'michigan', 'buying', 'bitcoin', 'source', 'billion', 'brown', 'coinbase', 'sources', 'university', 'crypto']","According to two sources familiar with the situation, Harvard, Yale, Brown and the University of Michigan as well as several other colleges have been buying crypto directly on exchanges.
