The cryptocurrency almost doubled in value over the weekend and clocked two-month highs earlier today. The price action suggests some traders bought XRP in anticipation of a price pump, inadvertently pushing it higher. Some of them may now be trapped on the wrong side of the market.

At press time, the exact reason for the price dump is not known. It’s quite possible that a whale (large investor) took advantage of the price rise and dumped his holdings. Pump and dump strategies are not new to crypto markets, particularly for XRP.

A Reddit post, which talked about a crowd buying attack at 08:30 and how it could be successful, has now been removed by Ripple moderators.

“Traditional Crypto-Pump groups are being copied and legitimized by WallStreetBets-style crowd-pumps, and are now turning their burning gaze from dogecoin to XRP,” Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Hong Kong-based Kenetic Capital, told CoinDesk.

Classic pump and dump tactics are not new to crypto, particularly for XRP, which has a strong army of followers. However, their morale may have been boosted by a group of amateur day traders based on a Reddit forum called WallStreetBets, who recently launched a coordinated buying attack on the video game retailer GameStop (GME), triggering a short squeeze and inflicting heavy losses for hedge funds.

GameStop surged nearly 400% last week, extending the preceding week’s 83% rise and attracting unwanted attention from regulators. Meanwhile, the meme-based cryptocurrency dogecoin surged 800% a day before XRP’s price pump. The data suggests the crowd buying tactics are returning to their home turf, having democratized the legacy markets.

In a Friday filing, Ripple Labs pushed back against the SEC’s allegations, which claim the San Francisco-based firm violated U.S. securities laws for over seven years by selling $1.3 billion worth of XRP tokens.

“The functionality and liquidity of XRP are wholly incompatible with securities regulation. To require XRP’s registration as a security is to impair its main utility,” the response said.

In a 93-page filing, Ripple responded to each of the SEC’s paragraphs. In its affirmative defenses, Ripple stated that XRP is not a security or investment contract, and the firm’s sales or distributions of XRP are likewise not investment contracts.

Ripple rebuttal

The SEC sued Ripple in December 2020, alleging the company, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chairman Chris Larsen sold over $1 billion in XRP, promoted the token and paid third parties to support the cryptocurrency.

Parts of Ripple’s response seem to focus on what XRP actually does, in the company’s view, saying the SEC complaint ignored that XRP is open source and claiming that its price has correlated with the price of bitcoin and ether.

“The Complaint mischaracterizes advice that Ripple received in 2012, from which a reasonable reader actually would have concluded that Ripple Credits (a past name for XRP) were not a security,” the filing adds a few paragraphs down.

Ripple is also claiming that the SEC did not provide fair notice that its sales of XRP might be violating the law.

It pointed to its settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network in 2015, which registered XRP as a convertible virtual currency and allowed for sales and secondary market transactions.

“Upon information and belief, Plaintiff knew of that 2015 settlement and yet, for years after, Plaintiff provided Defendants with no clear notice that, in Plaintiff’s view, Defendants’ prospective XRP sales as permitted by the agreement would nevertheless constitute a violation of another federal law,” the response said.

Commodity clarity

In addition to filing its response, Ripple filed a Freedom of Information Act request for documents from the SEC on how it determined that bitcoin and ether, the top two cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, are not securities.

“To date, they have offered no guidance for that determination, hindering responsible players like Ripple from being able to innovate in the U.S. to bring faster, cheaper and more transparent global payments to consumers who need them the most. As we have said for many years, we’re simply asking for the rules to be clearly stated and applied consistently,” a spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

Job losses at IBM (NYSE: IBM) escalated as the company failed to meet its revenue targets for the once-fêted technology by 90% this year, according to one of the sources.

“IBM is doing a major reorganization,” said a source at a startup that has been interviewing former IBM blockchain staffers. “There is not really going to be a blockchain team any longer. Most of the blockchain people at IBM have left.”

IBM’s blockchain unit missed its revenue targets by a wide margin for two years in a row, said a second source. Expectations for enterprise blockchain were too high, they said, adding that IBM “didn’t really manage to execute, despite doing a lot of announcements.”

A spokesperson for IBM denied the claims.

“Our blockchain business is doing well, thank you,” Holli Haswell, a director of public relations at IBM, said via email. “We have realigned some leaders and business units to continue to drive growth – we do that every year.”

A former IBM staffer who had been working on enterprise blockchain, however, said there have been a succession of “Resource Actions,” or RAs, which basically means firing people based on business performance as opposed to personal performance.

“I would wager less than 10% [of the blockchain product and engineering team] is still working on IBM Blockchain,” said the ex-IBM source. “There have been tons of reorgs. Pretty much everyone is gone. IBM is now 100% focused on hybrid cloud, so everything that doesn’t support that is deprioritized.”

IBM has pumped a lot of money into blockchain since 2016, when it began talking about the technology’s potential to transform the way industries do business.

If IBM’s blockchain innovation work is now confined to some R&D, and does not even extend to consulting, as one of the sources said, this sounds an ominous note for the enterprise blockchain space in general – perhaps particularly for the Hyperledger collection of blockchains, to which IBM was a key contributor.

In its recent full-year results statement, IBM as a whole reported revenue fell 6% on an annualized basis. Looking back to its 2017 financial statement, IBM called itself the “blockchain leader for business.” All mention of the technology is now absent from the company’s statements.

No more TV commercials

In the past several years, IBM has pushed ahead with a series of blockchain networks built on Hyperledger Fabric. Big Blue’s major blockchain networks are FoodTrust, a farm-to-supermarket tracking system backed by Walmart; and TradeLens, a shipping container logistics blockchain backed by Maersk. IBM has also added the Trust Your Supplier network and previously had a go at payments via World Wire.

While cryptocurrencies and public blockchain networks appear to have flourished in 2020, the economic shock of COVID-19 has impacted innovation departments inside large firms, to the extent that areas not immediately generating revenue – such as blockchain – have been trimmed.

Another source, an enterprise blockchain engineer with former ties to IBM, estimated more than 100 blockchain-related jobs were cut at Big Blue over the last year.

The source also pointed out that Jerry Cuomo, IBM’s head of blockchain and an evangelist for the tech going back to 2016, has been moved and is now working on artificial intelligence.

“Jerry is indeed overseeing additional strategic, high-growth parts of the IBM business but is still involved in blockchain,” said Haswell, the company spokesperson. “He is a very senior technical leader and that is what we do in IBM – people’s roles expand.”

After publication of this article, Haswell further disputed the reporting, adding:

""IBM maintains a strong team dedicated to blockchain across the company. We have shifted some resources but remain committed to the technology, blockchain ecosystem and services. We see blockchain as a driver for our cloud business.""

The top cryptocurrency hit a peak price of $41,962 on Jan. 8 and has mostly traded the range of $29,000–$40,000 since, according to CoinDesk 20 data.

However, demand continues to outstrip supply amid the price lull. “In 2021 so far, around 26,000 BTC have been mined. Meanwhile, The Grayscale Investment Trust has acquired over 40,000 BTC in the same period,” Glassnode said in its weekly report.

Further, the number of coins held on exchange addresses continues to slide, taking sell-side liquidity off the market.

The balance of bitcoin held across all exchanges fell to a 2.5-year low of 2,349,040 on Monday, according to Glassnode.

Meanwhile, the number of whale entities – clusters of crypto wallet addresses held by a single network participant holding at least 1,000 BTC – jumped to a new record high of 2,218 on Sunday. The count has increased by over 50 during the recent bout of price consolidation in a sign of continued accumulation by investors large enough to influence market trends.

Lastly, the odds of a deeper drop due to profit-taking appear low, as the 24-hour average of bitcoin’s adjusted spent output ratio (aSOPR), recently fell to 1.00, indicating that coins moving between investors are no longer carrying profit. The SOPR metric measures the profit ratio of coins based on the prices when they last moved. The aSOPR ignores all outputs with a lifespan of less than 1 hour.

Bitcoin's aSOPR Source: Glassnode

Investors typically sell at a loss during bear markets, but bitcoin is currently in a bull market, having rallied by 200% in the past three months.

“For SOPR to go lower, investors would have to be willing to sell at a loss, which is unlikely given the current shape of the market. We have been looking for this reset to generate some stability in the market and pave the way for the next bull run,” Glassnode recently said. Historically, values below 1.0 have been consistently rejected during bull markets.

So, the odds appear stacked in favor of a convincing bitcoin move above $40,000. “The breakout may happen in two weeks; everything is bullish now,” trader and analyst Alex Kruger told CoinDesk over Twitter.

Kruger, however, cited potential dollar strength as a short-term risk to bitcoin’s bullish outlook. The Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback’s value against major currencies, is looking north, with the daily chart reporting an inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) breakout – a major bullish pattern (below right).

“If a bullish trend develops from DXY’s latest breakout, it could be a problem for bitcoin,” Kruger said. The breakout has opened the doors for a rise to 93.00. The DXY is trading near 91.12 at press time, little changed on the day.

Matthew Dibb, COO and co-founder of Stack Funds, voiced similar concerns while drawing attention to the fact that bitcoin’s rally from early November lows near $14,000 happened alongside the DXY’s decline from 94.5 to 89.00.

Bitcoin has moved mainly in the opposite direction to the U.S. dollar since the March markets crash, with the cryptocurrency witnessing consolidation or pullbacks during bouts of strength in USD. Bitcoin’s recent decline from record highs and the subsequent consolidation has been accompanied by a recovery rally in the dollar.

The inverse correlation between the two is likely the result of the dollar’s negative correlation to the appetite for risk in the global financial markets.

“Whenever risk sentiment deteriorates around the globe; there is a natural desire to move to safety in the form of the U.S. dollar. And by extension, bitcoin, which is still an emerging asset, is exposed to risk-off,” Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital, told CoinDesk.

However, the dollar’s overall trend looks bearish, courtesy of the Federal Reserve’s open-ended money printing strategy, and analysts remain confident about the cryptocurrency’s long-term prospects.

“Both for the medium and long term, bitcoin remains attractive, and ultimately, on that longer-term proposition, bitcoin should become an in-demand currency during periods of risk-off,” Kruger said.","['kruger', 'bitcoins', 'renewed', 'ahead', 'fundamentals', 'bitcoin', 'point', 'source', 'bullish', 'rally', 'market', 'dollar', 'risk', 'price', 'breakout']","Bitcoin exchange balance Source: GlassnodeThe balance of bitcoin held across all exchanges fell to a 2.5-year low of 2,349,040 on Monday, according to Glassnode.

The company hopes to give customers a reason to keep their crypto on the Gemini platform.

The product is offered in all 50 states, including New York, where Gemini has its trust license. Users can get yield on any cryptocurrency available on the Gemini platform now and on Gemini’s GUSD stablecoin at some point in the future. The product is open to active Gemini customers currently and will be rolled out to all Gemini customers later this month.

Gemini collects part of the spread between interest paid on the crypto and interest Genesis charges on its loans to institutions.

The latest leg higher from $1,200 came alongside turmoil in the stock markets, where brokerage platforms like Robinhood have restricted transactions to rein volatility fueled by Reddit-based retail traders’ coordinated buying in stocks such as GameStop.

That’s helping to drive several of these exchanges’ tokens to new highs.

Last week GameStop (GME) and and other stocks involved in a battle between a short-selling hedge fund and a Reddit group captured the imagination of the general public, a battle that drove these stocks’ prices higher and squeezed the short seller.

Now, some of that buying excitement has spilled over to crypto where CEX and DEX trading volumes have risen over the past week, according to several crypto trading data sites.

“ATH [all-time highs] on a few different matrices” [for BNB], Changpeng Zhao, chief executive of Binance, tweeted earlier Monday.

Through a spokesperson, Zhao told CoinDesk that Binance’s utility token’s price rally is driven by its multiple use cases.

“[BNB’s] use cases have expanded to hundreds of applications on numerous platforms and projects within the crypto ecosystem [and] these are reflected in its growing price,” said the spokesperson, quoting Zhao. “…To become a true mass-adopted application, BNB must be able to facilitate billions of transactions per day. In its current form, we still have a long way to go.”

The traffic spike last weekend pushing BNB and FTT to the record highs likely resulted from increased trading traffic by retail traders coming from the traditional stock market, according John Todaro, director of institutional research at TradeBlock. (Cryptocurrency analytics firm TradeBlock is a subsidiary of CoinDesk.)

“The recent retail trading saga has shown that trading platforms, brokerages and even exchanges can shut down aspects of the trade process without much notice,” Todaro said. “This pushed some retail traders into cryptocurrency markets, as we saw with dogecoin, xrp, and stellar lumens catching a bid on the week.”

In an effort to capitalize on the retail trading frenzy caused by the GameStop stock drama, FTX last week listed a WallStreetBets (WSB) index quarterly futures contract, named for the Reddit group involved with the GameStop drama. The basket of stocks in the contract include GameStop plus Nokia (NOK), BlackBerry (BB), AMC Entertainment (AMC) plus the iShares Silver Trust (SLV) because of recent interest in silver.

“FTX lists tokenized equities, so investors could also be anticipating that Robinhood users and others may switch over to FTX to continue investing in stocks without the limits that various traditional brokerages have applied on their retail users,” Todaro added.

As of press time, FTX did not respond to CoinDesk’s requests for comment.

UniSwap and SushiSwap lead way for DEXs

Activity in decentralized finance (DeFi) is on the upswing. Total January trading volume on DEXs soared to an all-time high above $50 billion. On a seven-day basis, UniSwap and SushiSwap, the two leading DEXs, took 48.8% and 23.3%, respectively, of all DEX trading volumes, according to Dune Analytics’ DEX metrics tracker.

“Overall, the [crypto] market has had a lot of volume increased, both on CEX and DeFi,” Peter Chan, lead quant trader at Hong Kong-based OneBit Quant, told CoinDesk. He credits growing trade volume on SushiSwap for its SUSHI token’s price surge.

At the same time, Uniswap (UNI) and SushiSwap tokens exceeded their previous high prices, on Jan 31. and Feb. 1, respectively, according to data from Messari’s decentralized finance tracker.

Retail traders appear to be driving at least part of the price movement. The number of Google searches for “Uniswap,” the biggest decentralized exchange by market cap, is almost as high as during last year’s “DeFi summer” boom. That is an indicator of retail demand for DEXs, according to TradeBlock’s weekly newsletter of Feb. 1. It also reflects some retail traders’ growing concerns regarding centralized trading platforms, with more people wanting to learn about decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap.

Meanwhile, alternative cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance are stealing the spotlight.

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $33,782 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 2.5% over the previous 24 hours.

The price of bitcoin is extending its weekend respite Monday, trading in a fairly tight $32,500-$34,500 range, although its 24-hour performance is up 2.5% as of press time.

“XRP – and DOGE interestingly – both jumped over the weekend while most of the majors, including BTC and ETH, floundered,” noted Andrew Tu, an executive at quantitative trading firm Efficient Frontier. “While the timing is hard to say, it is usually the case after a period of low volatility that the market breaks out in one direction or the other.”

Bitcoin spot trading volumes on major exchanges were at $2.6 billion Monday as of press time on the eight major venues tracked on the CoinDesk 20. That’s much lower than frenzied $4.8 billion average the past month, but well within earshot of the three-month average of $2.7 billion.

Lower volumes may explain some price sluggishness. Yet, given its 16% rise over the past month, Tu is skewing more bull than bear.

“The market seems to be leaning bullish, though a break to the downside again is always possible,” he said.

“January was a bumper month for bitcoin spot and futures volume, easily establishing new monthly all-time highs,” noted Jason Lau, chief operating officer of San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin. “For OKCoin, January spot volumes were more than two times December, which was already an all-time high,” Lau added “There’s clearly still a lot of interest in bitcoin as an asset, with the latest seeing Elon Musk expressing his support.”

Lau told CoinDesk he is seeing a consolidation of bitcoin prices at current levels after the run-up to $42,000. He noted bitcoin’s dominance, a measure of the world’s oldest cryptocurrency market share in the ecosystem, continues to drop. Less than a month ago, on Jan. 3, bitcoin dominance peaked at over 73% and it has dropped roughly 10% since then.

SushiSwap eating up DEX market share

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was up Monday, trading around $1,334 and climbing 2% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).

SushiSwap is making gains in trading volume market share for decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, hitting an all-time high of over 23% of the entire market as of press time, according to data aggregator Dune Analytics.

SushiSwap is a “fork” of reigning DEX by volume Uniswap, meaning that Uniswap’s smart contract code was used to create the rival exchange. Peter Chan, head of trading for OneBit Quant, says both SushiSwap and Uniswap are benefiting from cryptocurrency price gyrations to better position themselves in the market. “They both experienced huge growth in volume lately, most due to increased market volatility,” Chan told CoinDesk.

In addition, Misha Alefirenko, co-founder of crypto market maker VelvetFormula, says the DEX exchanges’ token price gains recently enticed traders to switch from centralized exchanges (CEX) over to DEXs. “As we saw in the rally in altcoins, it is predictable that DEXs gain some market share from CEXs, especially in native DeFi tokens.”

XRP, the native asset of San Francisco-based Ripple Labs, experienced a huge price run-up and subsequent precipitous fall Monday, making it the top loser on the CoinDesk 20 the past 24 hours.

“The XRP pump and dump may have been another situation where retail day traders brought the price upwards only to crash it,” noted Efficient Frontier’s Tu. “It seems like this sort of phenomenon is going to become more commonplace, especially in less-liquid markets like crypto, having been legitimized by the current zeitgeist.”

This gap led to a controversial rule proposed by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) late last year, an official said Monday.

Speaking at a virtual panel hosted by compliance firm TRM Labs, FinCEN Deputy Director Michael Mosier was referring to a rule that would require crypto exchanges to report transactions involving private wallets (sometimes referred to as unhosted wallets) worth over $10,000 per day, as well as collect counterparty information for wallets that receive over $3,000 in crypto per day. The rule was proposed in the waning days of the Trump Administration by then-Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

If crypto is like cash, “why does the CTR, the currency transaction reporting requirement, apply to cash and banks and money services businesses but you have this gap with crypto,” Mosier asked.. “… There’s a concern at the senior government level, including political leaders here and abroad.”

The proposed rule, which was introduced on Dec. 18, 2020, would impose stringent data collection requirements on exchanges within the U.S.

While the CTR aspect is in line with requirements on cash transactions, the industry pushed back heavily against the counterparty information requirement, noting that among compliance burdens it would prevent U.S. crypto holders from sending funds to smart contract wallets, which by their nature don’t have names or addresses tied to them.

Mapping old laws to new tech

According to fellow panelist Jai Ramaswamy, the head of risk, compliance and regulatory policy at cLabs, one issue is that much of the U.S.’ financial regulations are centered around using intermediaries in financial transactions.

Ramaswamy is a former head of the U.S. Department of Justice’s money laundering section, and wrote an opinion piece on how unhosted wallet restrictions might backfire last year for industry organization Coin Center.

In Monday’s talk, he said the Bank Secrecy Act’s core regulation focuses on these intermediaries identifying malicious or illegal activity and reporting that to the federal government.

“When you move to a world where those financial intermediaries are no longer the gatekeepers, if you will, and individuals are transacting peer-to-peer, it raises concerns about ‘okay what do you do in a disintermediated world when the regulatory regime is focused on having those financial intermediaries play a pretty important and crucial role in managing the risk of bad money in the system,’” he said.

He later added that, in his view, it’s not clear whether the Bank Secrecy Act’s clauses can map well onto a system based on peer-to-peer transactions.

However, he said that “even criminals” would need to convert their crypto funds back to fiat to use them, hinting that regulations around these points of conversion may be sufficient to meet the law’s requirements.

“At some point in the value chain they need to get cash, to get currency because that is legal tender,” he said.

Future comments

Mosier said FinCEN staff realized the rule’s 15-day comment period was not going to cut it, that the public needed more time. The agency first added 15 more days. With the arrival of the Biden administration, FinCEN tacked on another 60.

The additional time gives industry members a window to more fully comb through – and critique – a rule proposal as complex as it is controversial. Many have already submitted detailed rebuttals that bemoaned the proposal’s original expedited comment period. Coin Center has even filed a second volley.

Mosier said that finding the distinction between cash and crypto is a key target of the ongoing comment period. The comment period discussion can help FinCEN apply the old guardrails where applicable and develop new safeguards for new technology.

He also emphasized the proposed rule has multiple components, and encouraged responders to discuss the different aspects.

“It’s a proposal, it’s not all or nothing. Tell us about what works” and what doesn’t on the technical and conceptual front, Mosier said.

Comments that used practical and technical examples would be more helpful than just comments focused on conceptual issues, he said.

Staying ahead

The rulemaking process could also help FinCEN stay ahead of lawmakers who, Mosier said, might “overreact” to headline-grabbing incidents with a seemingly suspect cryptocurrency bent.

An example is the $500,000 in bitcoin payments made to far-right figures one month before the U.S. Capitol siege in Washington, D.C. That payment, which federal law enforcement agencies are investigating, has little to do with unhosted wallets but it plays into the same overarching angle that crypto can be used for crime.

“That’s the kind of low-probability, high-impact event that could cause lawmakers and others to overreact in terms of laws and regulations, and we want to be ahead of that,” Mosier said.

Some lawmakers are already calling for a closer scrutiny of the digital asset space as a result of the Jan. 6 insurrection. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) published a statement earlier this month asking for the Department of Justice to investigate the bitcoin transaction.","['cash', 'period', 'close', 'crypto', 'wallets', 'fincen', 'financial', 'cryptocash', 'mosier', 'rule', 'gap', 'reporting', 'intermediaries', 'wallet', 'proposed', 'aims']","This gap led to a controversial rule proposed by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) late last year, an official said Monday.

Melvin Capital, the $8 billion hedge fund that didn’t find GameStop (GME) funny, lost 53% of its portfolio in January ($7 billion) trying to short against the rallying cries of the Reddit Capitalist Union. Founder Gabe Plotkin also faces the embarrassment of having to get bailed out by his old boss.

Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter.

Speaking of, Steven A Cohen, New York Mets baseball team owner and former name-on-the-door of SAC Capital (known most recently for its insider trading fine of $1.8 billion), put $2.8 billion of capital into Melvin’s fund.

Ken Griffin, owner of the Citadel hedge fund (an investor in Melvin), and Citadel Securities (a massive market maker and buyer-of-order-flow for Robinhood), is seeing capital losses in the former and Washington, D.C., cries for scrutiny into market structure in regards to the latter.

Robinhood itself – which, for goodness sake, is not Wall Street but as Silicon Valley as it possibly gets – raised $1 billion immediately to protect itself from class-action lawsuits, DTCC capital calls and a now-rapidly closing IPO window. That means Yuri Milner of DST Global chipping in yet again.

That’s at least four people that have had a very bad, no good day.

The Reddit WallStreetBets army has eight million members. Robinhood has 13 million users. These are the opposing forces. They are, loosely speaking, having a pretty good day.

This isn’t about how much money you have. This is about a mindset and a framing of the world. It’s about who you are and who you are not.

But other billionaires are having way more fun. The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, is raising the crypto rallying flag and ex-Facebook billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya is trading along with Reddit for quick profits, decentralized hedge fund and all. This isn’t about how much money you have. This is about a mindset and a framing of the world. It’s about who you are and who you are not. And it’s about what you did and did not do.

Do you side with the internet’s gamer heroes, wearing Nyan cat shirts and crying out sarcastically for “moar Stonks, money printer go brrrr, number go up”! A post-Gawker-4chan swirl of human vectors, coalescing into one giant middle finger to every Karen and Ken? Dopamine splashing out from our pituitary glands into a vortex tornado of well-earned resentment.

Or, do you like your finance suited, ministerial, administrative and gated? Do you think it is storied, respectable and important. That you have to go to HYP and then do your “two and two” at Goldman and HBS before hopping to KKR or Tiger or SAC and then into your own cozy fund? All that work, all that sweat for the GMAT and the SAT and the bootlicking, to be undone by someone literally making fun of you in the language of money.

It’s not about some truth about Wall Street or Silicon Valley or the internet or bitcoin or decentralized finance (DeFi) and least of all about GameStop (GME). Those are just flags of our armies. And we are at war with ourselves.

GameStop is a mall shop that sold video games. The mall shops that rented videos (Blockbuster) or sold books (Borders) are bankrupt and rightly dead. The internet, and its children Netflix and Amazon, killed them. And yet, their names are etched into the collective childhood memories of millions. GameStop has no chance against Steam or Epic – both brands that are also deeply loved by nerds all over the world. We say this as self-incrimination. And yet, GameStop is a symbol, a feeling, a reminiscence.

The person building financial models and analyzing this stuff according to economics is “right” to point out bad things about “fundamentals” of the business. Within the game of financial capital markets, the fundamentals are the gears of the economic machines that you evaluate with capital decisions. You buy good fundamentals, says Warren Buffett and you sell bad ones. Another Warren, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, also believes in fundamentals. She believes in them so much she wants the government to regulate them into the market and “fair, orderly and efficient function.”

All that might be right, and we are not doubting the wisdom of John Maynard Keynes or the animal spirits. But Warren Buffett is no longer number one. It’s an Elon Musk world now.

Fundamentals are what the financial doctors will tell you that you have. Do you think the internet cares about their diagnosis? No. The internet cares about being patronized by people in coats. Musk and Chamath are the mushrooms of the internet. It is in their DNA.

The GameStop trade itself is worth a pause. While some of the original thinking by DeepF**kingValue that led to his $30+ million capital gain reflected on the GameStop business, the core insight was market structure. The trade was not about GameStop beating its analyst estimates or any of that boring-play-by-the-rules stuff. It was about a short squeeze. It was about restricting the supply of the stock in such a way as to blow up a levered short bet that Melvin Capital was putting into play.

In other words, we are talking about the meta-game, not the grunt Excel spreadsheet game. SAC, Tiger, Point72, Melvin Capital and every other hedge fund worth its salt plays the meta-game. That’s the whole point. You get a PhD in financial instruments by doing the work and testing the levers rather than believing in them blindly. And WallStreetBets dared to play the meta-game as well. Retail investors aren’t supposed to self-organize into a hive-mind of levered derivatives strategy driven by spite. And here we are.

To go short, Melvin has to borrow. To borrow, you have to pay an interest rate. To cover your short, you have to buy back the stock. You’re paying an interest rate and have to buy back the stock. Nobody is selling you the stock, because they hate you. Everyone is buying, to troll you specifically. They are levering up with options. And you keep raising your bids until you cover your position.

Robinhood is a broker/dealer. It came into being in Silicon Valley, a place where consumer services are free because they are actually not services but honeypots that aggregate user demand, package it at large scale and re-sell attention to advertisers. Such is Facebook and Google. Our lives are better because of these services, but also compromised and profoundly insane.

Robinhood uses this playbook to aggregate consumer demand with the honeypot of free trading, and then sends it to market makers like Citadel Securities and gets paid $600 million for the orders. TD Ameritrade and eTrade and other discount brokers do this, too! But Robinhood does it most, and does it best. Check out our prior explanation with Paul Rowady here.

There is nothing unusually nefarious going on. It is just American capital markets structure and a clever lead-generation arbitrage. That is, if customers are still getting best-execution with Citadel. But the structure is ancient by modern technology standards, and far from real-time. It takes two days for a trade to settle, and this among other reasons leads to a requirement of capital to be placed with a “clearing house,” in this case the DTCC. Given the volatility in GameSpot caused by the internet trying to break a hedge fund the way George Soros broke the Bank of England, capital requirements skyrocketed tenfold.

Robinhood, as well as TD Ameritrade, ended up restricting trading in the instrument as a result of this capital call. If you are burning and raising a billion dollars per year, you probably don’t have a “tenfold” of cash lying around to give to the DTCC to make it feel comfy. So, you know, it just removed the “Buy” button for a whole bunch of crusaders on a mission with their capital on the line. They didn’t remove the “Sell” button, thereby throwing fire on the internet conspiracy meme machine.

Was this done on instruction from Citadel billionaires? Was this the banksters colluding against the common person? Was “Wall Street” trying to take away our constitutional freedom to trade on a mobile app? Even U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez found common ground in finding someone to blame!

It’s not a lot of rioters yet.

But remember, fintech – including Robinhood, Revolut, SoFi and the rest – is supposed to democratize access to financial services. That meant very little a decade ago, and “dumb money” was disorganized and uninformed. Now, information is free and available to all. Equities trading is largely costless and frictionless. And the scariest part, for the suited part of finance anyway, is that strength lies in numbers and can now self-organize.

In addition to this, we have the crypto currency ecosystem. Unlike fintech, which went after distribution, blockchain goes after manufacturing. If you are a trader or market maker on Ethereum, there is no clearinghouse. There is no broker/dealer. There is only you and the distributed machine with its smart contracts, automated rule sets and software-enforced property rights. All data is real-time. The blocks click into being one after another without a single lawyerly piece of paper in sight. Hundreds of millions of people in the world have touched this asset class and it renders financial intermediaries unnecessary in their imagination.

Now don’t get us wrong. A trade on Ethereum is going to cost you $10 to $100 today, and another 1% in slippage. It is going to cost you some immeasurable but ever-present probability of cyber risk and regulatory overhang. But you nobody can take away your “Buy” or “Sell” button, and the speed and scale issues are mere technical problems to be solved by the entrepreneurial gods.

Here’s the rub, post-fintech-crypto-democratization and all.

Humans are social animals. It is in our bones. The concept of fairness has been selected through the evolutionary filter and fueled a cooperation-based multi-billion person civilization.

Democracy is not oligarchy. Democracy means each person has one vote. If you were to vote according to assets under management, which is how finance has done it to date, you get very different outcomes than when you vote person by person. Now we have a set of promises and representation from companies like Robinhood that suggest a democratic empowerment of individuals to access the storied products of finance. Most people don’t know, or want to know, how the actual machine works. When the promises have a gap to reality, because of whatever reason, this creates kinetic energy for Twitter and Reddit.

It creates energy for people in the position of leverage who understand the machine, and want it to change. Elon Musk hates short-sellers for their damping, and perhaps manipulating, effect on his promises of Tesla greatness. Certainly Chamath, having launched endless SPACs to take Silicon Valley fintech distributors like SoFi public, understands the machine as well. For them, this tear in the fabric of reality is a power. It is a rallying cry.

Retail investors aren’t supposed to self-organize into a hive-mind of levered derivatives strategy driven by spite. And here we are.

If we really want to put this into dystopian context, let’s at least reference the theory of overcrowding elites from Peter Turchin. The historian eerily predicted the 2020 rioting and disaffection back in 2010, suggesting that societies fall apart when they over-produce members of the ruling class. Education has minted PhDs, MBAs and entrepreneurs who have no seat to inherit from a retiring predecessor. As a result, they take on the populist mantle and position themselves as outsiders to attack the insiders, while of course being fabulously gifted. Thus Donald Trump and all the rest.

If you are holding power today you probably don’t want everything to fall apart just because Redditors hate a caricatured notion of hedge funds. So you tweak things at the edges. Edit out the glitches in the current matrix. It is through this lens that we see Google deleting 100,000 negative Robinhood reviews for being “inauthentic.”

Of course they were coordinated. But they were very authentic to the people who wrote them. They were, however, “inauthentic” to the current rule-set of the game. Based on fundamentals, market structure and a variety of other “this is how things work” explanations, Robinhood did nothing wrong. Nor did Melvin, really, as far as we can tell from the media coverage. It just played a game that has become a cartoon that millions of people despise. Google’s app store is also an incumbent, a rule-set as well of what constitutes good behavior and what you should do according to its Terms, and so on. Protecting Robinhood’s reputation because it did not fundamentally err is what you do when you believe the current system works.","['billion', 'person', 'tech', 'internet', 'financial', 'cant', 'gamestop', 'sokolin', 'using', 'old', 'fund', 'democratize', 'market', 'capital', 'robinhood', 'hedge', 'finance']","The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, is raising the crypto rallying flag and ex-Facebook billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya is trading along with Reddit for quick profits, decentralized hedge fund and all.
Within the game of financial capital markets, the fundamentals are the gears of the economic machines that you evaluate with capital decisions.
SAC, Tiger, Point72, Melvin Capital and every other hedge fund worth its salt plays the meta-game.
But remember, fintech – including Robinhood, Revolut, SoFi and the rest – is supposed to democratize access to financial services.
Based on fundamentals, market structure and a variety of other “this is how things work” explanations, Robinhood did nothing wrong."

At stake

Silver lining?

Crowd-driven market dynamics that took the world by storm last week are still in play. After traders on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets drove shares of GameStop from $19 in December to $347 last Wednesday, squeezing the short position of a formerly high-flying hedge fund, some are saying the genie is out of the bottle: Small investors are empowered like never before. Their magic? Virality.

This morning, silver traded above $30 an ounce, after being promoted on Twitter and Reddit all weekend. Similar spikes occurred in crypto markets last week. Dogecoin went parabolic, briefly entering the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Perhaps this isn’t so surprising for a coin that’s little more than a meme, as world’s richest man Elon Musk said on Clubhouse last night.

Bitcoin also benefited from internet exuberance after Musk updated his Twitter bio to just #bitcoin on Friday. A surge to $38,000 wiped out $387 million worth of short positions, though the momentum didn’t last long. Even comments from Musk last night that bitcoin is “a good thing” have failed to move the needle.

While it appears WallStreetBets has yet to rally behind bitcoin, despite repeated calls for hivemind price action to send it to the moon, XRP did. As CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported, the Buy & Hold XRP Telegram group, founded on Saturday, successfully orchestrated a classic pump and dump of the beleaguered cryptocurrency.

The crypto hit a two-month high, erasing much of the value lost after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed suit against Ripple Labs, which holds a significant chuck of XRP. (Ripple responded to SEC allegations on Friday, arguing “the functionality and liquidity of XRP are wholly incompatible with securities regulation.”)

But as of press time, XRP is down 40%, showing the limits of coordinated buying. It’s unknown why the price tanked, though “it’s quite possible that a whale (large investor) took advantage of the price rise and dumped his holdings,” Godbole noted.

Is it all bad? Well, as Bloomberg noted, at least part of the reason silver didn’t go higher was the trouble in sourcing and moving its physical stock. Overwhelmed dealers said they were unable to process orders due to unprecedented demand.

Clarifying his thoughts on bitcoin, famed investor Ray Dalio noted its strength as a gold-like “storehold” of value. Unlike other alternatives, bitcoin is easily transferred and can be privately held.

You could call that a silver lining for digital gold.

[],,https://static.coindesk.com/static/chunks/images/facebook-cd851abcf9cbd3f39aaafc2c0a54009d.png,"In order to mine Ethereum, you need specialized computers that can perform the computations necessary to create new tokens on the blockchain in a timely manner as well as a significant amount of electricity, which is required to run the equipment continuously. All of this adds up to significant upfront costs.

Mining is the “glue” that holds together many cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, by ensuring that the network comes to consensus on each and every change made in the system. Ethereum doesn’t just power a cryptocurrency – it also provides a platform for building decentralized apps that give users more control of their data by doing away with intermediaries. Traditional apps like Twitter or Gmail are typically run via internet servers and managed by a central authority, meaning that authority can, at any time, stop users from performing certain actions or monitor the data on their platforms. Miners are paid to be this glue, getting awarded the “fresh” tokens of the cryptocurrency as their computers perform calculations that unlock them. That’s why most people take up the venture in the first place.

Miners set computers loose to grind through cryptographic computations in an attempt to win ether, Ethereum’s native token. They need to try a huge number of computational problems until one unlocks a new batch of the asset.

In theory, anyone can set their computers to focus on these cryptographic puzzles as a way to win rewards. The catch is that mining on major public blockchains tends to require more and more power over time. As more people invest in more powerful hardware to mine cryptocurrency, the calculations get harder. Miners using regular computers are very, very unlikely to win.

Choosing mining hardware

Before getting started, you will need special computer hardware to dedicate full-time to mining.

There are three types of mining hardware:

CPUs

GPUs: Faster than CPUs

ASICs: Even faster and more powerful than GPUs

GPUs and ASICs boast a higher hashrate, meaning they can guess puzzle answers more quickly. At time of writing, GPUs and ASICs are now the only cost-effective option for ether miners. CPUs aren’t powerful enough anymore.

Settling up a GPU is a complex task and you can browse plenty of advice about which ones are the most profitable based on how many hashes the GPU can compute per second, power consumption and the initial expense of the card.

You probably want to set up a mining rig, a machine that might be composed of multiple GPUs and can take a week to build.Online mining profitability calculators, such as the one offered by Etherscan, give some insight into the likely amount of ether you’ll earn at a given hashrate, and whether that ether is enough – when cutting out the costs of setup and electricity – to make a profit.

Installing Ethereum software

After selecting some mining hardware, the next step is to install the mining software.

Miners need to install an Ethereum client to connect to the wider Ethereum network. An internet connection is vital for miners. Without an internet connection, the node won’t be able to do much of anything.

Programmers familiar with the command line can install Geth, software that runs an Ethereum node written in the scripting language Go, or any of the other Ethereum clients, like Parity or OpenEthereum.

Download Geth here, using the directions for your appropriate operating system (Windows, Mac OS, or Linux), unzip it, and run it.

Once installed, your node can then connect to the Ethereum network where it can then “talk” to other nodes, to catch wind of the latest transactions and blocks. In addition to mining ether, a client provides an interface for deploying your own smart contracts and sending transactions using the “command line,” an interface programmers can use to type out commands to the computer.

Install Ethereum mining software

Aspiring miners then need to install the official mining software, Ethminer.

Find the download for the appropriate version of Windows here, or GPU mining instructions for other operating systems here.

Once installed, your node will officially play a part in securing the Ethereum network. For more detailed instructions on any of the above, visit the official ethereum website.

Joining a mining pool

As a miner, you’re unlikely to be able to mine ether on your own.

That’s why miners “pool” together their computational power into “mining pools,” to improve their chances of solving the cryptographic puzzles and earning ether. Then, they split the profits proportional to how much power each miner contributed.

There are many factors involved in joining a mining pool. Each pool might not be around forever, and the computational power of each pool is constantly changing, so there are a number of factors that go into deciding which to join.

One point to keep in mind is that mining pools have different payout structures. And pools charge mining fees.

Today the most popular mining pools are:

Ethermine

F2Pool

Sparkpool

Nanopool

The distribution of Ethereum mining pools as of Jan. 7, 2021. (Etherscan.io)

Mining pools generally have a signup process on their website so miners can connect to the pool and begin mining.

Find cheap electricity

The other biggest mining cost is electricity. Many profitable miners scout for electricity discounts, either by moving to regions around the world with less expensive electricity or by tapping renewable energy sources.

Ethereum Mining FAQs

Is Ethereum mining profitable?

The answer is complex. There are many variables miners need to consider when taking the plunge into mining, such as how much ether is worth at a given time and cost of electricity, an expensive necessity for mining. The cost of electricity varies across the globe.

How could the Ethereum upgrade ‘ProgPoW’ impact mining?

ProgPoW is a proposed Ethereum upgrade that, if implemented, would hamstring the most powerful miners. The motive for doing so is to keep the network decentralized by trying to ensure that no one in the network gets too much power.

In short, miners using ASICs (hardware even more powerful for mining than GPUs – see above) are the ones that would be affected. Their ASICs, which miners likely paid a premium for, would no longer be able to be used to mine ether.

How will Ethereum 2.0 upgrade impact mining?

The upgrade Ethereum 2.0 started roll out on Dec. 1, 2020, and will be iterated upon over the next several years.

The upgrade will impact mining even more drastically than ProgPoW. Once Ethereum 2.0 is fully rolled out, the goal is to eradicate miners completely, paving the way for a more energy-efficient method of maintaining the integrity of the Ethereum blockchain.

How do I keep abreast of Ethereum events that could impact mining?

The mining world is a whirlwind of change. The tools that you pick up today might be obsolete next year. Some mining pools might fall away while others emerge.

['Chris Cronimund'],,https://static.coindesk.com/static/chunks/images/facebook-cd851abcf9cbd3f39aaafc2c0a54009d.png,"If you are interested in buying or selling a cryptocurrency, there are few better places to look than one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trade volume, Binance.

Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao – who earned the number-one spot on CoinDesk’s 2018 Most Influential list – Binance rose to prominence during the historic crypto market-wide bull run in 2017 by supporting a wide array of cryptocurrencies in what was, and perhaps still is, one of the fastest and most reliable trading platforms.

In fact, Binance became so popular, so quickly that CZ and Binance both became worth more than $1 billion in less than one year, officially making it one of the first companies to achieve “unicorn” status in the cryptocurrency industry.

Yet despite its reputation as a destination for crypto traders, it’s not exactly easy for users who lack a traditional trading or investment background to navigate their way around.

In this piece, we take a step-by-step look at how to use Binance and conduct a trade on the exchange.

Signing up

First thing’s first, you’ll need to create an account. Anyone is able to sign up since Binance does not require customer information, but by doing so “you acknowledge and declare that you are not on any trade or economic sanctions lists” as per its Terms of Use.

This includes citizens of the member countries in the UN Security Council Sanctions list, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC), among other groups.

The terms also state each user must be at least 18 years of age. Binance reserves the right to cancel or freeze any account If the terms are disobeyed.

If the restrictions do not apply to you, to sign up simply navigate to the homepage and click register.

You will then be asked to enter a minimal amount of personal information such as your email address, password, and a referral ID if you have one.

As per Binance’s referral system, you will receive 50 percent of your referrals trading fees.

After you fill in the required fields, click “Register” and complete the captcha, a confirmation link will be sent to your email address.

Once the link is clicked, your Binance account is ready to be used.

Deposit Funds

Now that your account is activated, but before exploring the rest of the exchange, you’ll need to add funds to your account if you wish to buy or sell any cryptocurrencies.

Pay with credit card

Binance has a feature that allows users to purchase certain cryptocurrencies directly with their Visa or Mastercard credit card. If you are a qualified candidate, navigate to the “Funds” tab and select “Buy With Credit Card.”

You will then be required to enter the purchase amount of the desired cryptocurrency and whether you will be paying with the US dollar or euro. Cryptocurrency purchases by credit card are limited to BTC, ETH, and LTC at this time.

There is a minimum processing fee of $10 or 3.5 percent of the total order – whichever is more expensive. After completing this step, you will need to confirm your billing information, email address as well as your identity.

A valid government issued form of ID is required to be submitted to confirm your identity.

Once all of the required steps have been completed, the newly purchased cryptocurrency should reach your Binance wallet within 10-30 minutes.

Deposit from wallet

You can also make a deposit by sending funds from a separate cryptocurrency wallet into your Binance account.

In order to do this, navigate to the “Funds” tab once again and click “Balances.”

On this page, you will see all of the cryptocurrencies available for trading on Binance. To deposit the corresponding crypto into any of these, simply click the “Deposit” button next to the crypto asset of your choice.

Next, either scan the QR code from your cryptocurrency wallet or paste in the address and then send.

Once that’s complete, wait for the transaction to process and you’ll be ready for trading.

Placing a trade

Let’s go back to the home page now that your funds are ready to be used.

Here, you will again see all the cryptocurrencies that are tradable on Binance and their respective markets.

For this example, let’s say you previously deposited 0.0024 BTC (~$10) into your account and now wish to trade it for NEO.

First, you’ll need to find the right NEO market.

Since you want to spend BTC in order to get NEO, click the “BTC Markets” tab and then type NEO into the search bar.

Click the appropriate row and the page where trading takes place will open.

Trading module

This page may look intimidating, but you can easily get the hang of it with a bit of practice.

Plus, most cryptocurrency exchanges have a similar trading interface so what you remember here, in all likelihood, will be relevant elsewhere.

The left section of the screen is known as an order book.

Here, you will see all active buy and sell limit orders. A limit order is simply an order that will only be placed at the user’s desired price, given there are buyers or sellers interested at that level.

If you would like to learn the “in’s and out’s” of an order book, check out our comprehensive guide, but for now all you need to know is that the top of the order book (red) is where the limit sell orders wait to be filled and the bottom section (green) is where the limit buy orders wait to be filled.

The right side of the page is more simple – the above section shows the other cryptocurrencies that can be traded and the lower section shows the public trade history of the market currently being viewed.

Trade example: Buying NEO

The center of the page is where the real magic happens.

Here lays a chart feature that shows real-time price action and technical analysis indicators. Just below the chart is where you will actually execute the trade, so let’s buy some NEO.

If certainty of execution is your priority, select market order. If you are interested in only buying at a specific price level, select either limit or stop-limit order.

For the purposes of this example, let’s place a market order, which will be placed immediately at current market prices.

Now, just enter the amount of BTC desired to be spent and how much NEO you want to purchase. Binance has a useful shortcut for entering the purchase amount and it is based on a percentage of your bitcoin balance (or any other appropriate trading pair).

Let’s spend 50 percent of the BTC balance so there is some left over, perhaps for another trade.

The last step is to click the big green button “Buy NEO.” Since this is a market order, the trade for 0.58 NEO should have completed instantly, but that is most likely not the case if you selected limit or stop-limit order.

To check on the status of your order, look towards the bottom of the page where it says “Open order.” As the title would suggest, if your order has not yet executed, in other words, is still “open,” it will appear in this box until it has either been canceled or filled.

When it has been filled, it will show up in the lower box highlighting your 24-hour order history, just as how this order has below.

In order to sell, simply follow this same process but execute a market or limit sell order.

Withdrawing funds

While Binance does have a decentralized exchange in the works, the existing platform is centralized and susceptible to hacks like many other websites, so it’s recommended funds are only held on the exchange for as long as necessary.

In order to withdraw, navigate back to the “Balances” page. If you would like to see only the cryptocurrencies you have a substantial balance in, check the “hide” box.

Now select the withdrawal button in the NEO row and have your destination address or QR code handy. Paste the address and select how much you want to withdraw.

Last but not least, click submit and wait for the transaction to complete.

Binance Launchpad

The Binance Launchpad is a token launch platform exclusive to Binance and plans to offer token sales for new projects.

Binance handpicks which tokens to launch based on a number of factors including project maturity, scalability and adoption readiness, team quality and the ability of the project to benefit the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

To ensure the sales are being conducted in compliance with regulatory regimes around the world, each user must verify his or her Binance account.

Completed token sales, as well as those scheduled for a future date, can be seen on the home page of the Binance Launchpad. It’s worth noting that the token sales operate on a “first come, first serve” basis and usually sell out in just minutes, so be sure to do your due diligence.

If you successfully participate in a Launchpad token sale, the tokens will be automatically credited to your Binance account.

Security

Like most modern cryptocurrency exchanges, two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled on Binance and is highly recommended to be set up in order to add an extra layer of protection to your account.

In order to do so, navigate to your account summary by clicking the user avatar in the top right of the home page.

Once directed to your account page, a prompt will likely appear suggesting you to enable 2FA, which happens to automatically pops up when a new user accesses this page.

Binance allows two methods for enabling 2FA, via SMS or Google Authenticator.

With the SMS version, simply enter your mobile phone number and the verification code sent to the corresponding phone and you will be all set.

If Google Authenticator is your 2FA of choice, download the mobile application, open it and scan the QR code provided by Binance. Next, you will be asked to write down a 16-word recovery phrase to be used as a backup in case you lose access to this google authentication.

Lastly, you will be prompted to enter your account’s login password and the authenticator code found in the Google Authenticator mobile app. Once complete, this form of 2FA security will be complete.

Pros and Cons

Pros

If you're constantly on the go, Binance’s mobile application may be perfect for you. It's compatible with iOS, Android, as well as Mac and PC operating systems so just about anyone can place a trade or monitor their account from virtually anywhere.

Binance offers a large selection of tradeable cryptocurrency markets. As of May 1, 2019, 467 different markets are supported on the exchange.

Binance has it own native exchange token, BNB, which can be used to supplement trading fees and boost the overall liquidity on Binance.

Binance was a pioneer of the Initial Exchange Offerings, and It’s Launchpad facilitates sales once a month for those who are interested in being early holders of new tokens.

Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao – who earned the number-one spot on CoinDesk’s 2018 Most Influential list – Binance rose to prominence during the historic crypto market-wide bull run in 2017 by supporting a wide array of cryptocurrencies in what was, and perhaps still is, one of the fastest and most reliable trading platforms.

In fact, Binance became so popular, so quickly that CZ and Binance both became worth more than $1 billion in less than one year, officially making it one of the first companies to achieve “unicorn” status in the cryptocurrency industry.

Yet despite its reputation as a destination for crypto traders, it’s not exactly easy for users who lack a traditional trading or investment background to navigate their way around.

In this piece, we take a step-by-step look at how to use Binance and conduct a trade on the exchange.

Signing up

First thing’s first, you’ll need to create an account. Anyone is able to sign up since Binance does not require customer information, but by doing so “you acknowledge and declare that you are not on any trade or economic sanctions lists” as per its Terms of Use.

This includes citizens of the member countries in the UN Security Council Sanctions list, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC), among other groups.

The terms also state each user must be at least 18 years of age. Binance reserves the right to cancel or freeze any account If the terms are disobeyed.

If the restrictions do not apply to you, to sign up simply navigate to the homepage and click register.

You will then be asked to enter a minimal amount of personal information such as your email address, password, and a referral ID if you have one.

As per Binance’s referral system, you will receive 50 percent of your referrals trading fees.

After you fill in the required fields, click “Register” and complete the captcha, a confirmation link will be sent to your email address.

Once the link is clicked, your Binance account is ready to be used.

Deposit Funds

Now that your account is activated, but before exploring the rest of the exchange, you’ll need to add funds to your account if you wish to buy or sell any cryptocurrencies.

Pay with credit card

Binance has a feature that allows users to purchase certain cryptocurrencies directly with their Visa or Mastercard credit card. If you are a qualified candidate, navigate to the “Funds” tab and select “Buy With Credit Card.”

You will then be required to enter the purchase amount of the desired cryptocurrency and whether you will be paying with the US dollar or euro. Cryptocurrency purchases by credit card are limited to BTC, ETH, and LTC at this time.

There is a minimum processing fee of $10 or 3.5 percent of the total order – whichever is more expensive. After completing this step, you will need to confirm your billing information, email address as well as your identity.

A valid government issued form of ID is required to be submitted to confirm your identity.

Once all of the required steps have been completed, the newly purchased cryptocurrency should reach your Binance wallet within 10-30 minutes.

Deposit from wallet

You can also make a deposit by sending funds from a separate cryptocurrency wallet into your Binance account.

In order to do this, navigate to the “Funds” tab once again and click “Balances.”

On this page, you will see all of the cryptocurrencies available for trading on Binance. To deposit the corresponding crypto into any of these, simply click the “Deposit” button next to the crypto asset of your choice.

Next, either scan the QR code from your cryptocurrency wallet or paste in the address and then send.

Once that’s complete, wait for the transaction to process and you’ll be ready for trading.

Placing a trade

Let’s go back to the home page now that your funds are ready to be used.

Here, you will again see all the cryptocurrencies that are tradable on Binance and their respective markets.

For this example, let’s say you previously deposited 0.0024 BTC (~$10) into your account and now wish to trade it for NEO.

First, you’ll need to find the right NEO market.

Since you want to spend BTC in order to get NEO, click the “BTC Markets” tab and then type NEO into the search bar.

Click the appropriate row and the page where trading takes place will open.

Trading module

This page may look intimidating, but you can easily get the hang of it with a bit of practice.

Plus, most cryptocurrency exchanges have a similar trading interface so what you remember here, in all likelihood, will be relevant elsewhere.

The left section of the screen is known as an order book.

Here, you will see all active buy and sell limit orders. A limit order is simply an order that will only be placed at the user’s desired price, given there are buyers or sellers interested at that level.

If you would like to learn the “in’s and out’s” of an order book, check out our comprehensive guide, but for now all you need to know is that the top of the order book (red) is where the limit sell orders wait to be filled and the bottom section (green) is where the limit buy orders wait to be filled.

The right side of the page is more simple – the above section shows the other cryptocurrencies that can be traded and the lower section shows the public trade history of the market currently being viewed.

Trade example: Buying NEO

The center of the page is where the real magic happens.

Here lays a chart feature that shows real-time price action and technical analysis indicators. Just below the chart is where you will actually execute the trade, so let’s buy some NEO.

If certainty of execution is your priority, select market order. If you are interested in only buying at a specific price level, select either limit or stop-limit order.

For the purposes of this example, let’s place a market order, which will be placed immediately at current market prices.

Now, just enter the amount of BTC desired to be spent and how much NEO you want to purchase. Binance has a useful shortcut for entering the purchase amount and it is based on a percentage of your bitcoin balance (or any other appropriate trading pair).

Let’s spend 50 percent of the BTC balance so there is some left over, perhaps for another trade.

The last step is to click the big green button “Buy NEO.” Since this is a market order, the trade for 0.58 NEO should have completed instantly, but that is most likely not the case if you selected limit or stop-limit order.

To check on the status of your order, look towards the bottom of the page where it says “Open order.” As the title would suggest, if your order has not yet executed, in other words, is still “open,” it will appear in this box until it has either been canceled or filled.

When it has been filled, it will show up in the lower box highlighting your 24-hour order history, just as how this order has below.

In order to sell, simply follow this same process but execute a market or limit sell order.

Withdrawing funds

While Binance does have a decentralized exchange in the works, the existing platform is centralized and susceptible to hacks like many other websites, so it’s recommended funds are only held on the exchange for as long as necessary.

In order to withdraw, navigate back to the “Balances” page. If you would like to see only the cryptocurrencies you have a substantial balance in, check the “hide” box.

Now select the withdrawal button in the NEO row and have your destination address or QR code handy. Paste the address and select how much you want to withdraw.

Last but not least, click submit and wait for the transaction to complete.

Binance Launchpad

The Binance Launchpad is a token launch platform exclusive to Binance and plans to offer token sales for new projects.

Binance handpicks which tokens to launch based on a number of factors including project maturity, scalability and adoption readiness, team quality and the ability of the project to benefit the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

To ensure the sales are being conducted in compliance with regulatory regimes around the world, each user must verify his or her Binance account.

Completed token sales, as well as those scheduled for a future date, can be seen on the home page of the Binance Launchpad. It’s worth noting that the token sales operate on a “first come, first serve” basis and usually sell out in just minutes, so be sure to do your due diligence.

If you successfully participate in a Launchpad token sale, the tokens will be automatically credited to your Binance account.

Security

Like most modern cryptocurrency exchanges, two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled on Binance and is highly recommended to be set up in order to add an extra layer of protection to your account.

In order to do so, navigate to your account summary by clicking the user avatar in the top right of the home page.

Once directed to your account page, a prompt will likely appear suggesting you to enable 2FA, which happens to automatically pops up when a new user accesses this page.

Binance allows two methods for enabling 2FA, via SMS or Google Authenticator.

With the SMS version, simply enter your mobile phone number and the verification code sent to the corresponding phone and you will be all set.

If Google Authenticator is your 2FA of choice, download the mobile application, open it and scan the QR code provided by Binance. Next, you will be asked to write down a 16-word recovery phrase to be used as a backup in case you lose access to this google authentication.

Lastly, you will be prompted to enter your account’s login password and the authenticator code found in the Google Authenticator mobile app. Once complete, this form of 2FA security will be complete.

Pros and Cons

Like most modern cryptocurrency exchanges, two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled on Binance and is highly recommended to be set up in order to add an extra layer of protection to your account.

In order to do so, navigate to your account summary by clicking the user avatar in the top right of the home page.

Once directed to your account page, a prompt will likely appear suggesting you to enable 2FA, which happens to automatically pops up when a new user accesses this page.

Binance allows two methods for enabling 2FA, via SMS or Google Authenticator.

With the SMS version, simply enter your mobile phone number and the verification code sent to the corresponding phone and you will be all set.

If Google Authenticator is your 2FA of choice, download the mobile application, open it and scan the QR code provided by Binance. Next, you will be asked to write down a 16-word recovery phrase to be used as a backup in case you lose access to this google authentication.

Lastly, you will be prompted to enter your account’s login password and the authenticator code found in the Google Authenticator mobile app. Once complete, this form of 2FA security will be complete.

['Chris Cronimund'],,https://static.coindesk.com/static/chunks/images/facebook-cd851abcf9cbd3f39aaafc2c0a54009d.png,"If you are interested in buying or selling a cryptocurrency, there are few better places to look than one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trade volume, Binance.

Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao – who earned the number-one spot on CoinDesk’s 2018 Most Influential list – Binance rose to prominence during the historic crypto market-wide bull run in 2017 by supporting a wide array of cryptocurrencies in what was, and perhaps still is, one of the fastest and most reliable trading platforms.

In fact, Binance became so popular, so quickly that CZ and Binance both became worth more than $1 billion in less than one year, officially making it one of the first companies to achieve “unicorn” status in the cryptocurrency industry.

Yet despite its reputation as a destination for crypto traders, it’s not exactly easy for users who lack a traditional trading or investment background to navigate their way around.

In this piece, we take a step-by-step look at how to use Binance and conduct a trade on the exchange.

Signing up

First thing’s first, you’ll need to create an account. Anyone is able to sign up since Binance does not require customer information, but by doing so “you acknowledge and declare that you are not on any trade or economic sanctions lists” as per its Terms of Use.

This includes citizens of the member countries in the UN Security Council Sanctions list, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC), among other groups.

The terms also state each user must be at least 18 years of age. Binance reserves the right to cancel or freeze any account If the terms are disobeyed.

If the restrictions do not apply to you, to sign up simply navigate to the homepage and click register.

You will then be asked to enter a minimal amount of personal information such as your email address, password, and a referral ID if you have one.

As per Binance’s referral system, you will receive 50 percent of your referrals trading fees.

After you fill in the required fields, click “Register” and complete the captcha, a confirmation link will be sent to your email address.

Once the link is clicked, your Binance account is ready to be used.

Deposit Funds

Now that your account is activated, but before exploring the rest of the exchange, you’ll need to add funds to your account if you wish to buy or sell any cryptocurrencies.

Pay with credit card

Binance has a feature that allows users to purchase certain cryptocurrencies directly with their Visa or Mastercard credit card. If you are a qualified candidate, navigate to the “Funds” tab and select “Buy With Credit Card.”

You will then be required to enter the purchase amount of the desired cryptocurrency and whether you will be paying with the US dollar or euro. Cryptocurrency purchases by credit card are limited to BTC, ETH, and LTC at this time.

There is a minimum processing fee of $10 or 3.5 percent of the total order – whichever is more expensive. After completing this step, you will need to confirm your billing information, email address as well as your identity.

A valid government issued form of ID is required to be submitted to confirm your identity.

Once all of the required steps have been completed, the newly purchased cryptocurrency should reach your Binance wallet within 10-30 minutes.

Deposit from wallet

You can also make a deposit by sending funds from a separate cryptocurrency wallet into your Binance account.

In order to do this, navigate to the “Funds” tab once again and click “Balances.”

On this page, you will see all of the cryptocurrencies available for trading on Binance. To deposit the corresponding crypto into any of these, simply click the “Deposit” button next to the crypto asset of your choice.

Next, either scan the QR code from your cryptocurrency wallet or paste in the address and then send.

Once that’s complete, wait for the transaction to process and you’ll be ready for trading.

Placing a trade

Let’s go back to the home page now that your funds are ready to be used.

Here, you will again see all the cryptocurrencies that are tradable on Binance and their respective markets.

For this example, let’s say you previously deposited 0.0024 BTC (~$10) into your account and now wish to trade it for NEO.

First, you’ll need to find the right NEO market.

Since you want to spend BTC in order to get NEO, click the “BTC Markets” tab and then type NEO into the search bar.

Click the appropriate row and the page where trading takes place will open.

Trading module

This page may look intimidating, but you can easily get the hang of it with a bit of practice.

Plus, most cryptocurrency exchanges have a similar trading interface so what you remember here, in all likelihood, will be relevant elsewhere.

The left section of the screen is known as an order book.

Here, you will see all active buy and sell limit orders. A limit order is simply an order that will only be placed at the user’s desired price, given there are buyers or sellers interested at that level.

If you would like to learn the “in’s and out’s” of an order book, check out our comprehensive guide, but for now all you need to know is that the top of the order book (red) is where the limit sell orders wait to be filled and the bottom section (green) is where the limit buy orders wait to be filled.

The right side of the page is more simple – the above section shows the other cryptocurrencies that can be traded and the lower section shows the public trade history of the market currently being viewed.

Trade example: Buying NEO

The center of the page is where the real magic happens.

Here lays a chart feature that shows real-time price action and technical analysis indicators. Just below the chart is where you will actually execute the trade, so let’s buy some NEO.

If certainty of execution is your priority, select market order. If you are interested in only buying at a specific price level, select either limit or stop-limit order.

For the purposes of this example, let’s place a market order, which will be placed immediately at current market prices.

Now, just enter the amount of BTC desired to be spent and how much NEO you want to purchase. Binance has a useful shortcut for entering the purchase amount and it is based on a percentage of your bitcoin balance (or any other appropriate trading pair).

Let’s spend 50 percent of the BTC balance so there is some left over, perhaps for another trade.

The last step is to click the big green button “Buy NEO.” Since this is a market order, the trade for 0.58 NEO should have completed instantly, but that is most likely not the case if you selected limit or stop-limit order.

To check on the status of your order, look towards the bottom of the page where it says “Open order.” As the title would suggest, if your order has not yet executed, in other words, is still “open,” it will appear in this box until it has either been canceled or filled.

When it has been filled, it will show up in the lower box highlighting your 24-hour order history, just as how this order has below.

In order to sell, simply follow this same process but execute a market or limit sell order.

Withdrawing funds

While Binance does have a decentralized exchange in the works, the existing platform is centralized and susceptible to hacks like many other websites, so it’s recommended funds are only held on the exchange for as long as necessary.

In order to withdraw, navigate back to the “Balances” page. If you would like to see only the cryptocurrencies you have a substantial balance in, check the “hide” box.

Now select the withdrawal button in the NEO row and have your destination address or QR code handy. Paste the address and select how much you want to withdraw.

Last but not least, click submit and wait for the transaction to complete.

Binance Launchpad

The Binance Launchpad is a token launch platform exclusive to Binance and plans to offer token sales for new projects.

Binance handpicks which tokens to launch based on a number of factors including project maturity, scalability and adoption readiness, team quality and the ability of the project to benefit the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

To ensure the sales are being conducted in compliance with regulatory regimes around the world, each user must verify his or her Binance account.

Completed token sales, as well as those scheduled for a future date, can be seen on the home page of the Binance Launchpad. It’s worth noting that the token sales operate on a “first come, first serve” basis and usually sell out in just minutes, so be sure to do your due diligence.

If you successfully participate in a Launchpad token sale, the tokens will be automatically credited to your Binance account.

Security

Like most modern cryptocurrency exchanges, two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled on Binance and is highly recommended to be set up in order to add an extra layer of protection to your account.

In order to do so, navigate to your account summary by clicking the user avatar in the top right of the home page.

The cryptocurrency almost doubled in value over the weekend and clocked a two-month high earlier today. The price action suggests some traders bought XRP in anticipation of a price pump, inadvertently pushing it higher. Some of them may now be trapped on the wrong side of the market.

At press time, the exact reason for the price dump is not known. It’s quite possible that a whale (large investor) took advantage of the price rise and dumped his holdings. Pump and dump strategies are not new to crypto markets, particularly for XRP.

A Reddit post, which talked about a crowd-buying attack at 08:30 and how it could be successful, has now been removed by Ripple moderators.

The move more than reversed the late-December price slide triggered by legal troubles at the San Francisco-based payment protocol developer Ripple Labs, which has close ties to the digital asset.

XRP rose to a high of $0.6836 during European trading hours, its highest level since Nov. 25, extending the weekend’s rally from $0.27 to $0.50, according to CoinDesk 20 data. As a result, the cryptocurrency has replaced the tether stablecoin as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market value.

XRP prices fell from $0.55 to $0.20 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced a lawsuit against Ripple Labs on Dec. 22, triggering a number of exchange delistings of the cryptocurrency. The regulator charged the company with violating securities laws by raising $1.3 billion over seven years from retail investors through its sales of XRP.

Ripple Labs pushed back against the SEC’s allegations on Friday, arguing the functionality and liquidity of XRP are wholly incompatible with securities regulation, and its registration as a security would impair its main utility in faster, cheaper and more transparent global payments.

The cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid on Saturday, rising 56% to register its biggest single-day gain in three years, and has remained on the offensive ever since.

A coordinated effort by the members of the two-day-old Telegram group called “Buy & Hold XRP” alongside calls to buy XRP by the r/SatoshiStreetBets group seems to have helped push the cryptocurrency to multi-month highs. At press time, the Telegram pump group had 200,000 members.

However, some observers are of the opinion the Telegram traders may not be the sole drivers of the price rise. “24H volume on XRP on Sunday was over $26 billion. Even if each of the groups’ members dropped $5,000 on XRP, that equates to 2% of total daily volume. Let’s be rational here – no Telegram group is pumping the 5th largest coin in the space,” popular Twitter-based analyst Credible Crypto tweeted Sunday.

The cryptocurrency is trading near $0.66 at press time, representing a nearly 30% gain on the day.

“XRP’s next target is $0.80, which, if breached, would allow a rally to $1 and higher,” Alex Melikhov, CEO and founder of cryptocurrency framework Equilibrium and the EOSDT stablecoin, told CoinDesk.

The group’s membership hit Telegram’s 200,000 ceiling within the first 24 hours, forcing a migration to a new official channel with a similar title but a different link (t.me/pumpxrpofficial).

“Traditional Crypto-Pump groups are being copied and legitimized by WallStreetBets-style crowd-pumps, and are now turning their burning gaze from dogecoin to XRP,” Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Hong Kong-based Kenetic Capital, told CoinDesk.

Classic pump and dump tactics are not new to crypto, particularly for XRP, which has a strong army of followers. However, their morale may have been boosted by a group of amateur day traders based on a Reddit forum called WallStreetBets, who recently launched a coordinated buying attack on the video game retailer GameStop (GME), triggering a short squeeze and inflicting heavy losses for hedge funds.

GameStop surged nearly 400% last week, extending the preceding week’s 83% rise and attracting unwanted attention from regulators. Meanwhile, the meme-based cryptocurrency dogecoin surged 800% a day before XRP’s price pump.

The top cryptocurrency hit a peak price of $41,962 on Jan. 8 and has mostly traded the range of $29,000–$40,000 since then, according to CoinDesk 20 data.

However, demand continues to outstrip supply amid the price lull. “In 2021 so far, around 26,000 BTC have been mined. Meanwhile, the Grayscale Investment Trust has acquired over 40,000 BTC in the same period,” Glassnode said in its weekly report.

Further, the number of coins held on exchange addresses continues to slide, taking sell-side liquidity off the market.

Bitcoin exchange balance Source: Glassnode

The balance of bitcoin held across all exchanges fell to a 2.5-year low of 2,349,040 on Monday, according to Glassnode.

Meanwhile, the number of whale entities – clusters of crypto wallet addresses held by a single network participant holding at least 1,000 BTC – jumped to a new record high of 2,218 on Sunday. The count has increased by over 50 during the recent bout of price consolidation in a sign of continued accumulation by investors large enough to influence market trends.

Lastly, the odds of a deeper drop due to profit-taking appear low, as the 24-hour average of bitcoin’s adjusted spent output ratio (aSOPR), recently fell to 1.00, indicating that coins moving between investors are no longer carrying profit. The SOPR metric measures the profit ratio of coins based on the prices when they last moved. The aSOPR ignores all outputs with a lifespan of less than one hour.

Bitcoin's aSOPR Source: Glassnode

Investors typically sell at a loss during bear markets, but bitcoin is currently in a bull market, having rallied by 200% in the past three months.

“For SOPR to go lower, investors would have to be willing to sell at a loss, which is unlikely given the current shape of the market. We have been looking for this reset to generate some stability in the market and pave the way for the next bull run,” Glassnode recently said. Historically, values below 1.0 have been consistently rejected during bull markets.

So, the odds appear stacked in favor of a convincing bitcoin move above $40,000. “The breakout may happen in two weeks; everything is bullish now,” trader and analyst Alex Kruger told CoinDesk over Twitter.

Kruger, however, cited potential dollar strength as a short-term risk to bitcoin’s bullish outlook. The Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback’s value against major currencies, is looking north, with the daily chart reporting an inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) breakout – a major bullish pattern (below right).

“If a bullish trend develops from DXY’s latest breakout, it could be a problem for bitcoin,” Kruger said. The breakout has opened the doors for a rise to 93.00. The DXY is trading near 91.12 at press time, little changed on the day.

Matthew Dibb, COO and co-founder of Stack Funds, voiced similar concerns while drawing attention to the fact that bitcoin’s rally from early November lows near $14,000 happened alongside the DXY’s decline from 94.5 to 89.00.

Bitcoin has moved mainly in the opposite direction to the U.S. dollar since the March markets crash, with the cryptocurrency witnessing consolidation or pullbacks during bouts of strength in USD. Bitcoin’s recent decline from record highs and the subsequent consolidation has been accompanied by a recovery rally in the dollar.

The inverse correlation between the two is likely the result of the dollar’s negative correlation to the appetite for risk in the global financial markets.

“Whenever risk sentiment deteriorates around the globe there is a natural desire to move to safety in the form of the U.S. dollar. And by extension, bitcoin, which is still an emerging asset, is exposed to risk-off,” Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital, told CoinDesk.

However, the dollar’s overall trend looks bearish, courtesy of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s open-ended money printing strategy, and analysts remain confident about bitcoin’s long-term prospects.

“Both for the medium and long term, bitcoin remains attractive and, ultimately, on that longer-term proposition, bitcoin should become an in-demand currency during periods of risk-off,” Kruger said.","['price', 'breakout', 'point', 'kruger', 'renewed', 'risk', 'bitcoins', 'bullish', 'rally', 'market', 'source', 'fundamentals', 'bitcoin', 'ahead', 'dollar']","Bitcoin exchange balance Source: GlassnodeThe balance of bitcoin held across all exchanges fell to a 2.5-year low of 2,349,040 on Monday, according to Glassnode.

“I think we’ll see more interest in bitcoin again if we move solidly above $35,000,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for Swissquote Bank. “On the support side for bitcoin is institutional buying in the low $30,000s.”

Some exhaustion recently in the bitcoin market may have been caused by speculative activity in the stock market.

“So much attention has been on U.S. equities markets as of late, a lot of the mainstream and crypto outlets have been much less focused on driving the formation of opinions of traders and hodlers,” said John Willock, chief executive officer of crypto custody provider Tritum.

Equities on major indexes were all up Tuesday.

In addition to the bullish sentiment keeping stocks buoyant, it should be noted the price per 1 BTC has been able to stay above $30,000 for quite a while.

The last time bitcoin’s closing price was under $30,000, according to CoinDesk 20 data, was on New Year’s Day, when it closed at $29,333. It hasn’t looked back since.

“More than anything else, we should all take the long-term sustained price levels above the 2017 high of $20,000 now over a month as the best possible endorsement of bitcoin being a long-term bullish asset,” added Tritum’s Willock.

“Generally speaking, I think that the market is accepting higher prices while trying to digest the volatility,” noted Neil Van Huis, director of institutional trading at crypto liquidity provider Blockfills.

Bitcoin’s gyrations seem to have subsided somewhat, helped by a very flat weekend into Monday. As of Feb. 1, bitcoin’s 30-day volatility has trended downward; but it is still above 100%, which is quite high. The S&P 500, by comparison, has a 30-day volatility below 20%.

In the options market, traders are expecting a 62% chance of BTC over $32,000, based on their positions for February expirations. They seem to expect a 53% chance of trading over $34,000 and a 44% probability of bitcoin moving higher than $36,000, according to data collected by Skew.

Ether hits new price zenith, crypto locked in DeFi at all-time high

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, jumped Tuesday, trading around $1,526 and climbing 14.4% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET) – a fresh all-time high, according to CoinDesk 20 data.

The total value locked, or TVL, of crypto in U.S. dollar terms within decentralized finance (DeFi) is also hitting a brand-new high, going over $28 billion locked and at $28.8 billion as of press time, according to data aggregator DeFi Pulse.

Jun Dam, a smart-contract developer who has written code on the Ethereum and Tron platforms, noted that many decentralized exchanges have numerous pairs with ETH, and speculates traders may be selling some of their stash for DeFi tokens. “It seems like total DEX volume has increased significantly in 2021,” Dam told CoinDesk.

“DeFi is definitely the flavor,” concurred Swissquote’s Thomas. “There’s still good value out there if you consider the possibility that more people will move to DEXs in the next 12 months [and that] arguably the DEXs are still undervalued.”

USDC on exchanges “represents almost $1 billion worth of buying power from USDC alone, poised to move into assets” such as bitcoin, according to Glassnode’s weekly newsletter dated Feb 1. “This high figure should increase investors’ confidence in any dips being quickly bought up, making it a bullish signal.”

As CoinDesk reported Tuesday, some analysts see several on-chain metrics for bitcoin’s price pointing in a bullish direction in the coming weeks. For example, a decreased amount of bitcoin held on exchange addresses indicates less pressure on the sell side.

In crypto trading, traders and investors often use stablecoins to put money into riskier cryptocurrencies; in such cases, buying stablecoins backed by government-issued currencies is seen as the first step necessary before buying other cryptocurrencies.

“The growth in on-exchange USDC reflects the increasing view among traders that USDC is a preferred base currency, as well as the fact that a lot of the new flows into crypto are starting with on-exchange activity,” Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of peer-to-peer payments company Circle, told CoinDesk through a spokesperson. He noted that USDC issuance in January saw “record levels.” Circle and crypto exchange Coinbase are behind USDC’s governing Centre consortium.

The circulating supply of USDC, which is valued 1:1 with the U.S. dollar, has grown to over 5 billion from just below 4 billion in the beginning of the month, sharp growth after slowing in October, according to data from Glassnode.

Increased exchange activity is also reflected in the significant price rise of exchanges’ utility tokens. Centralized exchanges Binance and FTX and decentralized exchanges Uniswap and SushiSwap all saw their exchange tokens hit new all-time highs in the past week.

As of press time, MakerDAO did not respond to CoinDesk’s requests for comment regarding its dai stablecoin.

Data compiled by CoinDesk shows that tether (USDT) is still the stablecoin king despite recent controversies involving its issuing company. Tether currently has over $27 billion in market capitalization but its balance on exchanges in the past two months has been more volatile.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market value briefly topped $1,500, hitting $1,500.63, during early U.S. trading hours on Tuesday, passing the previous record price $1,459.93 last month, according to CoinDesk 20 data. In recent trading, ETH was at 1.494.26, up 14.28% over the last 24 hours.

The latest leg higher from $1,200 came alongside turmoil in the stock markets, where brokerage platforms like Robinhood have restricted transactions to rein volatility fueled by Reddit-based retail traders’ coordinated buying in stocks such as GameStop. The retail frenzy prompted by Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets forced hedge funds to unwind short bets in GameStop, leading to a 1,700% price rally in the 17 days to Jan. 28.

Crypto analysts believe the restrictive actions could bring more users into the DeFi space, which is dominated by Ethereum’s blockchain.

“With investment and trading platform Robinhood halting trading of certain assets like GameStop and Nokia (NOK), and Nasdaq President and CEO Adena Friedman calling for regulations to prevent retail investors from coordinating on social media, the case for cryptocurrencies only grows stronger,” Nicholas Pelecanos, head of trading at NEM Group, told CoinDesk.

According to Messari’s Ryan Selkis, the door for mass adoption of bitcoin, ethereum, DeFi and Web 3.0 assets has been flung open. “Buy ethereum to secure the fledging decentralized financial system and potentially make a lot of money, but also to tell your bank to f**k off,” Selkis noted in Thursday’s daily market brief.

Job losses at IBM (NYSE: IBM) escalated as the company failed to meet its revenue targets for the once-fêted technology by 90% this year, according to one of the sources.

“IBM is doing a major reorganization,” said a source at a startup that has been interviewing former IBM blockchain staffers. “There is not really going to be a blockchain team any longer. Most of the blockchain people at IBM have left.”

IBM’s blockchain unit missed its revenue targets by a wide margin for two years in a row, said a second source. Expectations for enterprise blockchain were too high, they said, adding that IBM “didn’t really manage to execute, despite doing a lot of announcements.”

A spokesperson for IBM denied the claims.

“Our blockchain business is doing well, thank you,” Holli Haswell, a director of public relations at IBM, said via email. “We have realigned some leaders and business units to continue to drive growth – we do that every year.”

A former IBM staffer who had been working on enterprise blockchain, however, said there have been a succession of “Resource Actions,” or RAs, which basically means firing people based on business performance as opposed to personal performance.

“I would wager less than 10% [of the blockchain product and engineering team] is still working on IBM Blockchain,” said the ex-IBM source. “There have been tons of reorgs. Pretty much everyone is gone. IBM is now 100% focused on hybrid cloud, so everything that doesn’t support that is deprioritized.”

IBM has pumped a lot of money into blockchain since 2016, when it began talking about the technology’s potential to transform the way industries do business.

If IBM’s blockchain innovation work is now confined to some R&D, and does not even extend to consulting, as one of the sources said, this sounds an ominous note for the enterprise blockchain space in general – perhaps particularly for the Hyperledger collection of blockchains, to which IBM was a key contributor.

In its recent full-year results statement, IBM as a whole reported revenue fell 6% on an annualized basis. Looking back to its 2017 financial statement, IBM called itself the “blockchain leader for business.” All mention of the technology is now absent from the company’s statements.

No more TV commercials

In the past several years, IBM has pushed ahead with a series of blockchain networks built on Hyperledger Fabric. Big Blue’s major blockchain networks are FoodTrust, a farm-to-supermarket tracking system backed by Walmart; and TradeLens, a shipping container logistics blockchain backed by Maersk. IBM has also added the Trust Your Supplier network and previously had a go at payments via World Wire.

While cryptocurrencies and public blockchain networks appear to have flourished in 2020, the economic shock of COVID-19 has impacted innovation departments inside large firms, to the extent that areas not immediately generating revenue – such as blockchain – have been trimmed.

Another source, an enterprise blockchain engineer with former ties to IBM, estimated more than 100 blockchain-related jobs were cut at Big Blue over the last year.

The source also pointed out that Jerry Cuomo, IBM’s head of blockchain and an evangelist for the tech going back to 2016, has been moved and is now working on artificial intelligence.

“Jerry is indeed overseeing additional strategic, high-growth parts of the IBM business but is still involved in blockchain,” said Haswell, the company spokesperson. “He is a very senior technical leader and that is what we do in IBM – people’s roles expand.”

After publication of this article, Haswell further disputed the reporting, adding:

""IBM maintains a strong team dedicated to blockchain across the company. We have shifted some resources but remain committed to the technology, blockchain ecosystem and services. We see blockchain as a driver for our cloud business.""

On Jan. 7 the total cryptocurrency market hit an all-time high exceeding $1 trillion for the first time. Renewed interest in, and conversations around, blockchain technology and digital currencies from industry and government leaders have accompanied the rise.

At the same time, the challenges of 2020 continue, including the global pandemic. COVID-19 dominated the recent Davos agenda, with the need for digital solutions and real-time multi-party access to consistent information highlighted across multiple sectors.

At the World Economic Forum, we will continue to work with hundreds of experts from governments, business, civil society and academia to bring together the seemingly disparate worlds of crypto and long-standing institutions.

Sheila Warren is the Head of Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology at the World Economic Forum.

Here are some of the top trends we are watching this year:

Identity

All eyes are on digital identity for COVID-related needs – but long-term strategies and implications remain to be seen.

The COVID-19 crisis has increased consumer demand for identity solutions that don’t compromise individual privacy and freedoms. Of course, ideas of what constitutes the ideal level of privacy preservation vary widely around the world, with China and the U.S. taking deeply divergent perspectives. As the travel industry and various governments continue to explore ideas like “immunity passports,” which would maintain vaccination and/or testing records, the creation of a global standard around digital credentialing seems both necessary and elusive.

In addition, what does it mean to anchor on digital identity as a reaction to a very specific set of circumstances (namely an unprecedented global pandemic)? Digital identity systems are relevant for everything from financial services to re-skilling workforces, which each have distinct requirements. Focusing on one sector without taking a longer-term view can mean that we lose out on opportunities, duplicate efforts and create more complicated user experiences.

As it stands, there are very few regulations or industry standards to prevent fragmentation of technical solutions, protect privacy or promote inclusivity, interoperability and portability – all essential principles – for digital credentialing beyond time-sensitive use cases. As global society struggles to return to “normal,” there is a need to ensure potential solutions that embrace the use of digital credentials, leverage the experience of the digital identity community, consider a longer-term and holistic view, and create strong partnerships with public authorities.

Institutional adoption

Last year was the year of “institutional investment” in bitcoin – a buzzy phrase that was seen across pundit analyses of the crypto rallies, referring to large-scale investments of players such as MassMutual and Square (SQ). It is likely that financial institutions and service providers will intensify their own experiments with, and use of, cryptocurrency this year, whether via investment or actual deployment.

In some instances, they are also being used for improving internal processes. For example, in a Davos agenda panel Hikmet Ersek, CEO of Western Union, cited the company’s use of a stable “WU Coin” to exchange different currencies, done “21 times every second.”

COVID-19 also raised the profile of the conversation around central bank digital currencies’ exploration of blockchain technology. We saw the launch of some of the first national-level blockchain-based systems, including in the Bahamas and Cambodia. At the same time, progress around China’s DCEP (Digital Currency/Electronic Payment) continued in the background, with the People’s Bank of China having completed pilots in Shenzhen, Xiong’an and Suzhou, processing RMB 1.1 billion across 3.1 million transactions.

Still, many governments and central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, continue to research whether central bank digital currencies (CBDC) hold potential but have maintained they do not see value in issuing one at this time. Many are also watching the growth in the stablecoin space – with total value now surpassing $25 billion – fueled by decentralized finance (DeFi) and institutional interest. This has corresponded with increased attention from regulators, for instance the controversial STABLE Act in the U.S. and the recent letter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. We can expect continued regulatory interest and activity in this area from around the world.

NFTs boost inclusive wealth

We have come a long way since CryptoKitties, yet relatively little progress has been made in realizing the potential of non-fungible tokens (a cryptocurrency token that is indivisible and unique) outside of the gaming context.

But we are already seeing shifts around the dialogue of inclusion. Previously, there was talk of democratizing access to high-value assets, such as art. While there still might be potential here, it’s important to consider the implications for creators as well. For instance, some have spotlighted black artists and the role that crypto art can play in allowing for greater ownership and wealth creation within the space, as well as art exchanges. We’ve also seen early signs of how this may translate to music or writing.

Decentralized infrastructure

Awareness of the power that centralized platforms and service providers wield over our lives is moving beyond the crypto and blockchain community to the mainstream. Take, for example, the recent mass exodus from WhatsApp to Signal following a (relatively minor) change in Facebook’s data-sharing policies.

This may create an increase in demand for decentralized service provision. In 2020, we saw the highly anticipated launch of Filecoin from Protocol Labs and continued growth of Web 3.0 projects such as Keep, Oasis and Polkadot. The public cloud market is among the most highly concentrated in existence, with four providers controlling 80% of the market. Decentralized cloud storage is currently the only alternative that could pose a challenge to this status quo. Along with advances in AI, this transition could lead to significant expansion of the scope of human and machine interaction, and an acceleration of the transition to Web 3.0.

Even as we have been wrestling with the consequences of the greatest social and economic disruption of our lifetimes, the pace of work across the blockchain ecosystem has been accelerating. The great news is that awareness of the potential of decentralized systems now lives beyond the minds of a tiny minority and is slowly gaining awareness among a larger audience (although the bitcoin price index remains the biggest reason most people pay any attention to the space).","['warren', 'currencies', 'digital', 'identity', 'decentralized', 'solutions', 'trends', 'global', 'sheila', 'blockchain', 'crypto', 'potential', 'watching', 'continue', 'im']","Renewed interest in, and conversations around, blockchain technology and digital currencies from industry and government leaders have accompanied the rise.

The vote went live on the web app Snapshot on Jan. 28 and ended today at 18:00 UTC (1 p.m. ET).

Yearn Finance is a collectively designed robo-advisor for yield that is fast becoming a portal into all of DeFi. It’s governed by the token YFI, which is worth slightly more than $30,000, as of this writing.

There’s a total of 30,000 YFI in existence, per the project’s original “fair launch.” If the new tokens were minted right now and had no impact on the market capitalization, then one would expect the value of YFI to drop to something like $25,000 (meaning the new tokens would be worth $167 million), but these things are not predictable.

The final vote to increase the supply was 1,670 YFI for versus 331 against.

To participate in a vote, YFI holders have to stake to the governance contract in advance of a vote by a specified Ethereum block number. The total amount of YFI staked to vote on YIP-57 was 4,089.

Final changes are approved by six of the nine members of the Yearn multisig, which is something like the DeFi equivalent of a board of directors.

Under the proposal, 33% of the new tokens would be set aside for key contributors. Which contributors the allocation would be for and how much each would get is unknown. There will be some sort of staking set up so contributors only get their allocations for sticking around, but none of that has been decided.

The other 66% will be set aside as a treasury, for everything from protocol acquisition to further development.

The decision marks a clear shift for the team, which accrued a unique amount of buzz for eschewing the convention of setting aside governance tokens for insiders.

The authors of the newly passed proposal wrote:

""Yearn's launch was exceptional at creating a decentralized and engaged community, but it did not provide adequate incentives to retain existing and future contributors on an ongoing basis, nor did it provide the protocol with a war chest to fund future activities.""

The community remains somewhat divided on the initiative. As the vote indicates, though, most YFI holders are for it.

On the supporter side, user zkwaffles wrote:

""This seems to be the equivalent of an equity raising round. In these rounds an early-stage venture will issue equity and in effect dilute current shareholders. ... The overarching idea being that the cash raised will increase future value enough to offset any dilution.""

On the opposition, user laur_science argued the proposal wasn’t specific enough:

""I don't like it, so I voted against. It doesn't even specify what type of vesting we're talking about. I want it to be for 5 years, equal amounts per year.""","['contributors', 'set', 'token', 'supply', 'proposal', 'inflate', 'yearn', 'future', 'defi', 'yfi', 'vote', 'tokens', 'votes', 'community', 'finance', '20']","The Yearn Finance community has been discussing expanding the supply of YFI as a way to compensate the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform’s de facto staffers.

Balancer, a non-custodial portfolio manager, is releasing version 2.0, which puts all the assets entrusted to it in one big vault. This should dramatically reduce gas fees for decentralized finance (DeFi) trades because users can swap as much as they want, only paying gas for going into and out of Balancer.

The team had considered building it this way from the start but decided initially to be conservative and separate out each pool for added security, CEO Fernando Martinelli told CoinDesk.

“We are today … comfortable enough with having a big vault that holds a lot of money. We put a lot of effort into making this as safe as if the assets were siloed,” he wrote in an email. “Many other protocols (not AMMs) already do this: lending protocols, collateral in MakerDAO, etc.”

Balancer works much like (and can serve the function of) an automated market maker (AMM) like Uniswap or Curve but it allows users to create pools of multiple tokens, weighted as they see fit. The pools automatically rebalance as needed in order to stay in line with the market.

This requires making a lot of transactions, which in turn require a lot of Ethereum gas fees. That is not capital-efficient for traders nor for liquidity pool providers, especially as gas prices tick upward.

In this new version, the accounting for those pools will just be done in smart contracts separate from the big custody pool.

One big pool

With Balancer v2, no matter how complex a trade or trades, “only the final net token amounts are transferred from and to the vault, saving a significant amount of gas in the process,” Martinelli wrote in an announcement post. Balancer can keep track of all of the assets entrusted to it in one vault and just move allocations around on people’s accounts.

“Now, token management and accounting is done by the vault while the AMM logic is individual to each pool. Because pools are contracts external to the vault, they can implement any arbitrary, customized AMM logic,” the team wrote.

In fact, the new version will even take it a step further. Active traders can set up an individual account so they can make lots of trades. Then they will only be charged gas fees when they want to withdraw.

Of course, that may sound more like a centralized exchange to some traders, which is somewhat fair. The key difference here is it’s all being kept on smart contracts that can be reviewed by the public; and, as an Ethereum project, its functionality can be easily integrated into others.

It does raise a security concern. To oversimplify it, think of it this way: If someone had a large treasure of gold, it would be trickier to steal it all if it were locked away in multiple vaults in different places rather than one big vault.

Martinelli does not dispute this, but he also notes that the more-complex logic in Balancer doesn’t touch the assets, which should be reassuring.

“Since the operations the vault will be doing are very low-level (add to a user balance, remove from a pool the user traded with), we will make everything (including formal verification) to make sure the vault is safe and sound,” Martinelli said via email.

Other developments

Balancer is adding some other features in version 2.0 that may be of interest to more advanced users. Crucially, it wants to make it easier to experiment with composition pools.

“Balancer v2 pioneers customizable AMM logic: [I]t effectively creates a launch pad for teams to innovate with different AMM strategies without having to worry about low level token transfers, balance accounting, security checks [and] smart order routing,” the announcement says.

It will go live with the familiar weighted pools that Balancer users know already. It will also have stable pools that work more as Curve does, so big trades on stablecoins can see very little slippage. Soon, Balancer will launch smart pools, whose logic can change on the fly.

Balancer will also introduce asset managers, external smart contracts that can be used to put some of a liquidity pools’ underlying value to work elsewhere in DeFi. This should be good for liquidity providers, because as the team notes, “in normal trading conditions, most of the assets in an AMM are not actually used.”

Balancer will also introduce trading fees that can be controlled by holders of its BAL token. It will offer fees on trades, withdrawals and flash loans. Only the final fee will be active at the start of version 2.0, however. BAL holders can use the fees either to pay for further development, for a dividend or some combination of both.

Balancer was one of the earliest projects to join the liquidity mining craze this summer, launching BAL distributions to users shortly after COMP distributions went live. Like on Compound, BAL liquidity mining has never stopped.

“We are currently discussing with the community some interesting updates to BAL liquidity mining. It will certainly continue though: it’s our main way to make sure we have a diverse and engaged governance,” Martinelli noted.","['liquidity', 'fees', 'cuts', 'amm', 'transactions', 'pools', 'gas', 'balancers', 'version', 'vault', 'balancer', 'pool', 'users', 'big']","Balancer, a non-custodial portfolio manager, is releasing version 2.0, which puts all the assets entrusted to it in one big vault.

In light of Robinhood’s disabling of buying in a number of stocks, there is a lot of fury about potential conflicts of interest that are not new but now suddenly in the spotlight.

The situation emphasizes the need for transparency in markets and why certain marketing that appears beneficial – “Trade stocks for free!” – may have deleterious characteristics under some circumstances.

Matthew Trudeau, chief Operating Officer at ErisX, has participated in the successful launch of 12 electronic trading venues. Prior to ErisX, Matthew was most recently co-founder and president of Tradewind Markets, an electronic trading platform and blockchain-based post trade system for physical precious metals.

In a practice known as “payment for order flow,” or PFOF, brokers sell their clients’ order flow to professional trading firms called “internalizers.” This practice has been covered by the media many times over the years, more recently by Institutional Investor and MSN. Brokers send individual investors’ orders, e.g., to buy stock in GameStop, to the internalizers that pay to trade against this “dumb flow.” The internalizers then net-offset the retail trades, keeping the spread, or offset trades on the national stock exchanges, presumably at a profit that exceeds the cost of their payments made to Robinhood and other retail brokers. The majority of retail equities orders never execute on an actual stock exchange.

So, retail traders trade for “free” and the brokers and professional internalizers still make lots of money. Not all market makers support PFOF. The question retail traders should be asking is, how much in hidden fees are they paying? If the non-transparent markups, spreads, or opportunity costs are greater than an explicit and transparent trade commission, then “free” may be pretty misleading. How fees and conflicts are disclosed and managed, or not, is pretty important. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seems to agree.

Well, good thing this only happens in equity trading. Crypto must be free of these conflicts, right?

Not exactly.

There is a lot of lip service paid to “democratizing access.” Call us fundamentalists, but when we envision a “democratized market” we envision an exchange where all members can trade with all other members according to a common set of rules and standards.

If the non-transparent markups, spreads or opportunity costs are greater than an explicit and transparent trade commission, then 'free' may be pretty misleading.

It’s a market where price discovery and liquidity are available to all on equal terms, and where the commingling of order flows from many different participants with diverse market outlooks and time horizons produce a better market quality. A central limit order book (CLOB), the model most typically found on regulated futures and stock exchanges such as the CME and Nasdaq, provides such a market structure (as we discussed here and here). On a CLOB, with a published price schedule and displayed quotations, the full cost of a trade is explicit and transparent: the price at which investors can purchase or sell a quantity of an asset plus the transaction fee. It is really pretty simple.

It does not strike us as very “democratic” when order flow gets channeled to exclusive liquidity providers that gain an informational advantage as a result of that exclusivity, particularly where that conflict is not well disclosed. Almost without fail, if a trading or pricing arrangement is not fully transparent there is, at worst, a problem or conflict. Or, as may be the case with unregulated/offshore markets, something untoward may be happening. At best there is an arrangement the parties would rather keep quiet from their products, er, customers.

As a new asset, crypto has had the opportunity to learn from the market structure examples of traditional markets. Unfortunately, some of the lessons that have ported over are sub-optimal arrangements rather than best practices.

An apparently significant part of the crypto market structure involves brokers sending client orders to over-the-counter “trading venues,” in that model a synonym for internalizing dealers. Or, in some cases, the broker is the dealer. (It is worth noting that in traditional markets there are strict rules that generally prohibit or restrict exchanges and brokers trading against their own clients.) OTC liquidity provision is a variation on the PFOF model. Instead of all-to-all trading with the explicit and transparent fees CLOBs enable, the OTC liquidity model replicates the implicit costs, informational advantages, opacity and potential conflicts of interest that have been problematic in equities and FX trading.

The Robinhood saga also exposes another risk of the exclusive liquidity provider model: counterparty risk. There has been a lot of speculation about why Robinhood disabled the buying of certain stocks. We will not wade into that discussion, but it does beg the question of what happens when the liquidity providers cannot or will not provide the liquidity, or cannot or will not settle trades. A CLOB diversifies counterparties and a clearinghouse eliminates settlement risk. These are proven market infrastructures that were designed in response to past market failures and disruptions.","['alltoall', 'liquidity', 'arent', 'matthew', 'trudeau', 'markets', 'transparent', 'retail', 'trading', 'model', 'brokers', 'trade', 'crypto', 'market', 'order']","Matthew Trudeau, chief Operating Officer at ErisX, has participated in the successful launch of 12 electronic trading venues.

“We think one of the biggest problems that need to be tackled exists on decentralized exchanges,” said Shumo Chu, CEO and co-founder of Manta Network, in an email.

“The volume is large and increasing on decentralized exchanges, but DEXs are also a hotbed for front-running opportunities due to the transparent nature of the blockchain. Someone can see your transaction before it gets written and confirmed, and make the same transaction with a higher fee to get priority and pass that transaction before you do.”

Privacy in DeFi

According to the survey, nearly three-quarters of the 404 respondents (73.2%) “have either hesitated or completely avoided making a transaction in the past because they were worried about the privacy implications of that transaction.”

Additionally, 84% of respondents expressed concern about their wallet addresses being linked to their real identity. Part of this concern was caused due to the fact that the nature of blockchains allows people to see address balances.

In fact, over 90% of survey respondents said they’d looked up someone’s wallet address to view that person’s holdings and/or transactions.

The survey adds further weight to the notion that privacy is a central concern in the cryptocurrency space, and the Manta Network is one of a number of different projects in the DeFi space working to increase privacy functionality.

The Manta Network

The Manta Network aims to bolster privacy in DeFi, in part, by obfuscating wallet addresses, but with the overall aim of letting users transact and exchange privacy. A parachain in the Polkadot ecosystem, Manta Network’s first major project is a privacy-preserving automated market maker (AMM) DEX called MantaSwap.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

The Manta Network is working to implement ZkSNARKs on the blockchain level. ZkSNARKs are a cryptographic technique that allows two entities to verify information with each other without having to share the underlying data related to it.

Think about it in the context of logging into a website, for example. The site verifies who you are without sharing your password, geolocation data or other information that can be used to figure out additional details about yourself that you aren’t aware you might be giving up.

According to Chu, Manta’s use of ZkSNARKS can bring privacy to transactions and user identity.

“While you are still able to monitor your own transactions, no one else can do so anymore,” he said. “By taking this and applying it in an interoperable manner (through Polkadot), we’re able to provide a plug-and-play solution for the entire ecosystem in the future.”

Right now though, Chu said the team is focusing on enhancing usability, given their goal is to be a plug-and-play solution. Additionally, they’re working to ensure transparency of both the code itself as well as the process.

“As part of the usability, we also want to focus on the security of the implementation, which takes time,” he said.

Why privacy matters

The implications for transparent transactions aren’t limited to someone knowing how much money is in an address. It can have tangible downstream effects, given that information is power.

In traditional finance, if you want to view your bank account information (including transactions and total cash), you have to prove that you are the owner of that account. No one else is allowed to view your information without your consent.

“It’s different on the blockchain – anyone who knows your wallet address can review your transactions, trace your transactions and see all of your assets,” said Chu.

Chu said that lack of privacy leads to a host of other issues that arise in scaling out blockchain use cases. Automated monitoring and scraping leads to unauthorized data collection, opening up potential opportunities for blackmail. In corporate use cases, trade secrets may be revealed by tracing transactions on chain.

On decentralized exchanges, that transparency leads to front-running opportunities, according to Chu. People are taking extra steps, which increases the friction of usage, just to make transactions more obfuscated.

Chu said the availability of privacy products are a secondary issue on DEXs, which is part of the reason he said he wants Manta Network to be plug and play.

“Future DEX projects don’t need to bring onboard their own cryptography team; they can use our development tools,” he said. “Other DeFi projects and general blockchain projects can do the same thing.”

Funding and the future

The Manta Network, which was previously a Web 3.0 Foundation Grant winner, closed a $1.1 million funding round, led by Polychain Capital, to build MantaSwap.

“Manta Network brings an experienced team to tackle the critical and growing issues regarding privacy on the blockchain,” said Ben Perszyk, partner at Polychain, in a statement. “Its unique approach to building as a Polkadot parachain enables them to offer plug-and-play privacy to a multitude of use cases and projects, starting with their own privacy-preserving DEX.”

The funding will jump-start Manta Network’s development. The team is currently finishing its prototype to deliver to the Web3 Foundation. Before the end of Q1, it will be delivering the first version of its test net. In future releases of the test net, it will introduce other assets as well as exchange functionality.","['getting', 'manta', 'network', 'transactions', 'defi', 'team', 'blockchain', 'wallet', 'privacy', 'information', 'transaction', 'boost', 'projects']","A new survey by Manta Network, a privacy-preserving decentralized finance stack built on Substrate, has shed further light on the need for privacy in the rapidly expanding DeFi space.

[],,https://static.coindesk.com/static/chunks/images/facebook-cd851abcf9cbd3f39aaafc2c0a54009d.png,"In order to mine Ethereum, you need specialized computers that can perform the computations necessary to create new tokens on the blockchain in a timely manner as well as a significant amount of electricity, which is required to run the equipment continuously. All of this adds up to significant upfront costs.

Mining is the “glue” that holds together many cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, by ensuring that the network comes to consensus on each and every change made in the system. Ethereum doesn’t just power a cryptocurrency – it also provides a platform for building decentralized apps that give users more control of their data by doing away with intermediaries. Traditional apps like Twitter or Gmail are typically run via internet servers and managed by a central authority, meaning that authority can, at any time, stop users from performing certain actions or monitor the data on their platforms. Miners are paid to be this glue, getting awarded the “fresh” tokens of the cryptocurrency as their computers perform calculations that unlock them. That’s why most people take up the venture in the first place.

Miners set computers loose to grind through cryptographic computations in an attempt to win ether, Ethereum’s native token. They need to try a huge number of computational problems until one unlocks a new batch of the asset.

In theory, anyone can set their computers to focus on these cryptographic puzzles as a way to win rewards. The catch is that mining on major public blockchains tends to require more and more power over time. As more people invest in more powerful hardware to mine cryptocurrency, the calculations get harder. Miners using regular computers are very, very unlikely to win.

Choosing mining hardware

Before getting started, you will need special computer hardware to dedicate full-time to mining.

There are three types of mining hardware:

CPUs

GPUs: Faster than CPUs

ASICs: Even faster and more powerful than GPUs

GPUs and ASICs boast a higher hashrate, meaning they can guess puzzle answers more quickly. At time of writing, GPUs and ASICs are now the only cost-effective option for ether miners. CPUs aren’t powerful enough anymore.

Settling up a GPU is a complex task and you can browse plenty of advice about which ones are the most profitable based on how many hashes the GPU can compute per second, power consumption and the initial expense of the card.

You probably want to set up a mining rig, a machine that might be composed of multiple GPUs and can take a week to build.Online mining profitability calculators, such as the one offered by Etherscan, give some insight into the likely amount of ether you’ll earn at a given hashrate, and whether that ether is enough – when cutting out the costs of setup and electricity – to make a profit.

Installing Ethereum software

After selecting some mining hardware, the next step is to install the mining software.

Miners need to install an Ethereum client to connect to the wider Ethereum network. An internet connection is vital for miners. Without an internet connection, the node won’t be able to do much of anything.

Programmers familiar with the command line can install Geth, software that runs an Ethereum node written in the scripting language Go, or any of the other Ethereum clients, like Parity or OpenEthereum.

Download Geth here, using the directions for your appropriate operating system (Windows, Mac OS, or Linux), unzip it, and run it.

Once installed, your node can then connect to the Ethereum network where it can then “talk” to other nodes, to catch wind of the latest transactions and blocks. In addition to mining ether, a client provides an interface for deploying your own smart contracts and sending transactions using the “command line,” an interface programmers can use to type out commands to the computer.

Install Ethereum mining software

Aspiring miners then need to install the official mining software, Ethminer.

Find the download for the appropriate version of Windows here, or GPU mining instructions for other operating systems here.

Once installed, your node will officially play a part in securing the Ethereum network. For more detailed instructions on any of the above, visit the official ethereum website.

Joining a mining pool

As a miner, you’re unlikely to be able to mine ether on your own.

That’s why miners “pool” together their computational power into “mining pools,” to improve their chances of solving the cryptographic puzzles and earning ether. Then, they split the profits proportional to how much power each miner contributed.

There are many factors involved in joining a mining pool. Each pool might not be around forever, and the computational power of each pool is constantly changing, so there are a number of factors that go into deciding which to join.

One point to keep in mind is that mining pools have different payout structures. And pools charge mining fees.

Today the most popular mining pools are:

Ethermine

F2Pool

Sparkpool

Nanopool

The distribution of Ethereum mining pools as of Jan. 7, 2021. (Etherscan.io)

Mining pools generally have a signup process on their website so miners can connect to the pool and begin mining.

Find cheap electricity

The other biggest mining cost is electricity. Many profitable miners scout for electricity discounts, either by moving to regions around the world with less expensive electricity or by tapping renewable energy sources.

Ethereum Mining FAQs

Is Ethereum mining profitable?

The answer is complex. There are many variables miners need to consider when taking the plunge into mining, such as how much ether is worth at a given time and cost of electricity, an expensive necessity for mining. The cost of electricity varies across the globe.

How could the Ethereum upgrade ‘ProgPoW’ impact mining?

ProgPoW is a proposed Ethereum upgrade that, if implemented, would hamstring the most powerful miners. The motive for doing so is to keep the network decentralized by trying to ensure that no one in the network gets too much power.

In short, miners using ASICs (hardware even more powerful for mining than GPUs – see above) are the ones that would be affected. Their ASICs, which miners likely paid a premium for, would no longer be able to be used to mine ether.

How will Ethereum 2.0 upgrade impact mining?

The upgrade Ethereum 2.0 started roll out on Dec. 1, 2020, and will be iterated upon over the next several years.

The upgrade will impact mining even more drastically than ProgPoW. Once Ethereum 2.0 is fully rolled out, the goal is to eradicate miners completely, paving the way for a more energy-efficient method of maintaining the integrity of the Ethereum blockchain.

How do I keep abreast of Ethereum events that could impact mining?

The mining world is a whirlwind of change. The tools that you pick up today might be obsolete next year. Some mining pools might fall away while others emerge.

As a miner it’s worth keeping aware of industry shifts by keeping tabs on the latest mining news as well as Ethereum protocol upgrades.","['electricity', 'network', 'upgrade', 'pools', 'power', 'mining', 'need', 'ethereum', 'ether', 'miners', '101']","Miners need to install an Ethereum client to connect to the wider Ethereum network.

Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao – who earned the number-one spot on CoinDesk’s 2018 Most Influential list – Binance rose to prominence during the historic crypto market-wide bull run in 2017 by supporting a wide array of cryptocurrencies in what was, and perhaps still is, one of the fastest and most reliable trading platforms.

In fact, Binance became so popular, so quickly that CZ and Binance both became worth more than $1 billion in less than one year, officially making it one of the first companies to achieve “unicorn” status in the cryptocurrency industry.

Yet despite its reputation as a destination for crypto traders, it’s not exactly easy for users who lack a traditional trading or investment background to navigate their way around.

In this piece, we take a step-by-step look at how to use Binance and conduct a trade on the exchange.

Signing up

First thing’s first, you’ll need to create an account. Anyone is able to sign up since Binance does not require customer information, but by doing so “you acknowledge and declare that you are not on any trade or economic sanctions lists” as per its Terms of Use.

This includes citizens of the member countries in the UN Security Council Sanctions list, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC), among other groups.

The terms also state each user must be at least 18 years of age. Binance reserves the right to cancel or freeze any account If the terms are disobeyed.

If the restrictions do not apply to you, to sign up simply navigate to the homepage and click register.

You will then be asked to enter a minimal amount of personal information such as your email address, password, and a referral ID if you have one.

As per Binance’s referral system, you will receive 50 percent of your referrals trading fees.

After you fill in the required fields, click “Register” and complete the captcha, a confirmation link will be sent to your email address.

Once the link is clicked, your Binance account is ready to be used.

Deposit Funds

Now that your account is activated, but before exploring the rest of the exchange, you’ll need to add funds to your account if you wish to buy or sell any cryptocurrencies.

Pay with credit card

Binance has a feature that allows users to purchase certain cryptocurrencies directly with their Visa or Mastercard credit card. If you are a qualified candidate, navigate to the “Funds” tab and select “Buy With Credit Card.”

You will then be required to enter the purchase amount of the desired cryptocurrency and whether you will be paying with the US dollar or euro. Cryptocurrency purchases by credit card are limited to BTC, ETH, and LTC at this time.

There is a minimum processing fee of $10 or 3.5 percent of the total order – whichever is more expensive. After completing this step, you will need to confirm your billing information, email address as well as your identity.

A valid government issued form of ID is required to be submitted to confirm your identity.

Once all of the required steps have been completed, the newly purchased cryptocurrency should reach your Binance wallet within 10-30 minutes.

Deposit from wallet

You can also make a deposit by sending funds from a separate cryptocurrency wallet into your Binance account.

In order to do this, navigate to the “Funds” tab once again and click “Balances.”

On this page, you will see all of the cryptocurrencies available for trading on Binance. To deposit the corresponding crypto into any of these, simply click the “Deposit” button next to the crypto asset of your choice.

Next, either scan the QR code from your cryptocurrency wallet or paste in the address and then send.

Once that’s complete, wait for the transaction to process and you’ll be ready for trading.

Placing a trade

Let’s go back to the home page now that your funds are ready to be used.

Here, you will again see all the cryptocurrencies that are tradable on Binance and their respective markets.

For this example, let’s say you previously deposited 0.0024 BTC (~$10) into your account and now wish to trade it for NEO.

First, you’ll need to find the right NEO market.

Since you want to spend BTC in order to get NEO, click the “BTC Markets” tab and then type NEO into the search bar.

Click the appropriate row and the page where trading takes place will open.

Trading module

This page may look intimidating, but you can easily get the hang of it with a bit of practice.

Plus, most cryptocurrency exchanges have a similar trading interface so what you remember here, in all likelihood, will be relevant elsewhere.

The left section of the screen is known as an order book.

Here, you will see all active buy and sell limit orders. A limit order is simply an order that will only be placed at the user’s desired price, given there are buyers or sellers interested at that level.

If you would like to learn the “in’s and out’s” of an order book, check out our comprehensive guide, but for now all you need to know is that the top of the order book (red) is where the limit sell orders wait to be filled and the bottom section (green) is where the limit buy orders wait to be filled.

The right side of the page is more simple – the above section shows the other cryptocurrencies that can be traded and the lower section shows the public trade history of the market currently being viewed.

Trade example: Buying NEO

The center of the page is where the real magic happens.

Here lays a chart feature that shows real-time price action and technical analysis indicators. Just below the chart is where you will actually execute the trade, so let’s buy some NEO.

If certainty of execution is your priority, select market order. If you are interested in only buying at a specific price level, select either limit or stop-limit order.

For the purposes of this example, let’s place a market order, which will be placed immediately at current market prices.

Now, just enter the amount of BTC desired to be spent and how much NEO you want to purchase. Binance has a useful shortcut for entering the purchase amount and it is based on a percentage of your bitcoin balance (or any other appropriate trading pair).

Let’s spend 50 percent of the BTC balance so there is some left over, perhaps for another trade.

The last step is to click the big green button “Buy NEO.” Since this is a market order, the trade for 0.58 NEO should have completed instantly, but that is most likely not the case if you selected limit or stop-limit order.

To check on the status of your order, look towards the bottom of the page where it says “Open order.” As the title would suggest, if your order has not yet executed, in other words, is still “open,” it will appear in this box until it has either been canceled or filled.

When it has been filled, it will show up in the lower box highlighting your 24-hour order history, just as how this order has below.

In order to sell, simply follow this same process but execute a market or limit sell order.

Withdrawing funds

While Binance does have a decentralized exchange in the works, the existing platform is centralized and susceptible to hacks like many other websites, so it’s recommended funds are only held on the exchange for as long as necessary.

In order to withdraw, navigate back to the “Balances” page. If you would like to see only the cryptocurrencies you have a substantial balance in, check the “hide” box.

Now select the withdrawal button in the NEO row and have your destination address or QR code handy. Paste the address and select how much you want to withdraw.

Last but not least, click submit and wait for the transaction to complete.

Binance Launchpad

The Binance Launchpad is a token launch platform exclusive to Binance and plans to offer token sales for new projects.

Binance handpicks which tokens to launch based on a number of factors including project maturity, scalability and adoption readiness, team quality and the ability of the project to benefit the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

To ensure the sales are being conducted in compliance with regulatory regimes around the world, each user must verify his or her Binance account.

Completed token sales, as well as those scheduled for a future date, can be seen on the home page of the Binance Launchpad. It’s worth noting that the token sales operate on a “first come, first serve” basis and usually sell out in just minutes, so be sure to do your due diligence.

If you successfully participate in a Launchpad token sale, the tokens will be automatically credited to your Binance account.

Security

Like most modern cryptocurrency exchanges, two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled on Binance and is highly recommended to be set up in order to add an extra layer of protection to your account.

In order to do so, navigate to your account summary by clicking the user avatar in the top right of the home page.

Once directed to your account page, a prompt will likely appear suggesting you to enable 2FA, which happens to automatically pops up when a new user accesses this page.

Binance allows two methods for enabling 2FA, via SMS or Google Authenticator.

With the SMS version, simply enter your mobile phone number and the verification code sent to the corresponding phone and you will be all set.

If Google Authenticator is your 2FA of choice, download the mobile application, open it and scan the QR code provided by Binance. Next, you will be asked to write down a 16-word recovery phrase to be used as a backup in case you lose access to this google authentication.

Lastly, you will be prompted to enter your account’s login password and the authenticator code found in the Google Authenticator mobile app. Once complete, this form of 2FA security will be complete.

Pros and Cons

Pros

If you're constantly on the go, Binance’s mobile application may be perfect for you. It's compatible with iOS, Android, as well as Mac and PC operating systems so just about anyone can place a trade or monitor their account from virtually anywhere.

Binance offers a large selection of tradeable cryptocurrency markets. As of May 1, 2019, 467 different markets are supported on the exchange.

Cons

If following government regulations like that of the US is important to you, then you may want to try out exchanges such As Coinbase or Gemini, because at this point Binance is still an unregulated exchange.

Many of Binance’s markets, specifically those of the lesser known altcoins, offer low liquidity which can make trading large altcoin positions difficult.

To check on the status of your order, look towards the bottom of the page where it says “Open order.” As the title would suggest, if your order has not yet executed, in other words, is still “open,” it will appear in this box until it has either been canceled or filled.

When it has been filled, it will show up in the lower box highlighting your 24-hour order history, just as how this order has below.

In order to sell, simply follow this same process but execute a market or limit sell order.

Withdrawing funds

While Binance does have a decentralized exchange in the works, the existing platform is centralized and susceptible to hacks like many other websites, so it’s recommended funds are only held on the exchange for as long as necessary.

In order to withdraw, navigate back to the “Balances” page. If you would like to see only the cryptocurrencies you have a substantial balance in, check the “hide” box.

Now select the withdrawal button in the NEO row and have your destination address or QR code handy. Paste the address and select how much you want to withdraw.

Last but not least, click submit and wait for the transaction to complete.

Binance Launchpad

The Binance Launchpad is a token launch platform exclusive to Binance and plans to offer token sales for new projects.

Binance handpicks which tokens to launch based on a number of factors including project maturity, scalability and adoption readiness, team quality and the ability of the project to benefit the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

To ensure the sales are being conducted in compliance with regulatory regimes around the world, each user must verify his or her Binance account.

Completed token sales, as well as those scheduled for a future date, can be seen on the home page of the Binance Launchpad. It’s worth noting that the token sales operate on a “first come, first serve” basis and usually sell out in just minutes, so be sure to do your due diligence.

If you successfully participate in a Launchpad token sale, the tokens will be automatically credited to your Binance account.

Security

Like most modern cryptocurrency exchanges, two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled on Binance and is highly recommended to be set up in order to add an extra layer of protection to your account.

In order to do so, navigate to your account summary by clicking the user avatar in the top right of the home page.

Once directed to your account page, a prompt will likely appear suggesting you to enable 2FA, which happens to automatically pops up when a new user accesses this page.

Binance allows two methods for enabling 2FA, via SMS or Google Authenticator.

With the SMS version, simply enter your mobile phone number and the verification code sent to the corresponding phone and you will be all set.

If Google Authenticator is your 2FA of choice, download the mobile application, open it and scan the QR code provided by Binance. Next, you will be asked to write down a 16-word recovery phrase to be used as a backup in case you lose access to this google authentication.

Lastly, you will be prompted to enter your account’s login password and the authenticator code found in the Google Authenticator mobile app. Once complete, this form of 2FA security will be complete.

Pros and Cons

Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao – who earned the number-one spot on CoinDesk’s 2018 Most Influential list – Binance rose to prominence during the historic crypto market-wide bull run in 2017 by supporting a wide array of cryptocurrencies in what was, and perhaps still is, one of the fastest and most reliable trading platforms.

In fact, Binance became so popular, so quickly that CZ and Binance both became worth more than $1 billion in less than one year, officially making it one of the first companies to achieve “unicorn” status in the cryptocurrency industry.

Yet despite its reputation as a destination for crypto traders, it’s not exactly easy for users who lack a traditional trading or investment background to navigate their way around.

In this piece, we take a step-by-step look at how to use Binance and conduct a trade on the exchange.

Signing up

First thing’s first, you’ll need to create an account. Anyone is able to sign up since Binance does not require customer information, but by doing so “you acknowledge and declare that you are not on any trade or economic sanctions lists” as per its Terms of Use.

This includes citizens of the member countries in the UN Security Council Sanctions list, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC), among other groups.

The terms also state each user must be at least 18 years of age. Binance reserves the right to cancel or freeze any account If the terms are disobeyed.

If the restrictions do not apply to you, to sign up simply navigate to the homepage and click register.

You will then be asked to enter a minimal amount of personal information such as your email address, password, and a referral ID if you have one.

As per Binance’s referral system, you will receive 50 percent of your referrals trading fees.

After you fill in the required fields, click “Register” and complete the captcha, a confirmation link will be sent to your email address.

Once the link is clicked, your Binance account is ready to be used.

Deposit Funds

Now that your account is activated, but before exploring the rest of the exchange, you’ll need to add funds to your account if you wish to buy or sell any cryptocurrencies.

Pay with credit card

Binance has a feature that allows users to purchase certain cryptocurrencies directly with their Visa or Mastercard credit card. If you are a qualified candidate, navigate to the “Funds” tab and select “Buy With Credit Card.”

You will then be required to enter the purchase amount of the desired cryptocurrency and whether you will be paying with the US dollar or euro. Cryptocurrency purchases by credit card are limited to BTC, ETH, and LTC at this time.

There is a minimum processing fee of $10 or 3.5 percent of the total order – whichever is more expensive. After completing this step, you will need to confirm your billing information, email address as well as your identity.

A valid government issued form of ID is required to be submitted to confirm your identity.

Once all of the required steps have been completed, the newly purchased cryptocurrency should reach your Binance wallet within 10-30 minutes.

Deposit from wallet

You can also make a deposit by sending funds from a separate cryptocurrency wallet into your Binance account.

In order to do this, navigate to the “Funds” tab once again and click “Balances.”

On this page, you will see all of the cryptocurrencies available for trading on Binance. To deposit the corresponding crypto into any of these, simply click the “Deposit” button next to the crypto asset of your choice.

Next, either scan the QR code from your cryptocurrency wallet or paste in the address and then send.

Once that’s complete, wait for the transaction to process and you’ll be ready for trading.

Placing a trade

Let’s go back to the home page now that your funds are ready to be used.

Here, you will again see all the cryptocurrencies that are tradable on Binance and their respective markets.

For this example, let’s say you previously deposited 0.0024 BTC (~$10) into your account and now wish to trade it for NEO.

First, you’ll need to find the right NEO market.

Since you want to spend BTC in order to get NEO, click the “BTC Markets” tab and then type NEO into the search bar.

Click the appropriate row and the page where trading takes place will open.

Trading module

This page may look intimidating, but you can easily get the hang of it with a bit of practice.

Plus, most cryptocurrency exchanges have a similar trading interface so what you remember here, in all likelihood, will be relevant elsewhere.

The left section of the screen is known as an order book.

Here, you will see all active buy and sell limit orders. A limit order is simply an order that will only be placed at the user’s desired price, given there are buyers or sellers interested at that level.

If you would like to learn the “in’s and out’s” of an order book, check out our comprehensive guide, but for now all you need to know is that the top of the order book (red) is where the limit sell orders wait to be filled and the bottom section (green) is where the limit buy orders wait to be filled.

The right side of the page is more simple – the above section shows the other cryptocurrencies that can be traded and the lower section shows the public trade history of the market currently being viewed.

Trade example: Buying NEO

The center of the page is where the real magic happens.

Here lays a chart feature that shows real-time price action and technical analysis indicators. Just below the chart is where you will actually execute the trade, so let’s buy some NEO.

If certainty of execution is your priority, select market order. If you are interested in only buying at a specific price level, select either limit or stop-limit order.

For the purposes of this example, let’s place a market order, which will be placed immediately at current market prices.

Now, just enter the amount of BTC desired to be spent and how much NEO you want to purchase. Binance has a useful shortcut for entering the purchase amount and it is based on a percentage of your bitcoin balance (or any other appropriate trading pair).

Let’s spend 50 percent of the BTC balance so there is some left over, perhaps for another trade.

The last step is to click the big green button “Buy NEO.” Since this is a market order, the trade for 0.58 NEO should have completed instantly, but that is most likely not the case if you selected limit or stop-limit order.

To check on the status of your order, look towards the bottom of the page where it says “Open order.” As the title would suggest, if your order has not yet executed, in other words, is still “open,” it will appear in this box until it has either been canceled or filled.

According to an excerpt from the firm’s upcoming “2021 Crypto Crime Report,” published Monday, online marketplaces providing illegal goods like drugs and fake IDs received a record-setting amount of cryptocurrency last year, equivalent to $1.7 billion. Russia, the U.S., Ukraine and China were the main areas of global money traffic to such platforms.

Darknet marketplaces receive most of their money through peer-to-peer crypto marketplaces and centralized exchanges, Chainalysis wrote. However, in 2020, the use of centralized exchanges increased, as did mixing services, which allow to obfuscate the participants in a cryptocurrency transaction.

Drug deal distribution

The report lists 10 countries where people are most actively interacting with dark markets: Russia, the U.S., Ukraine, China, the U.K., Venezuela, Vietnam, Turkey, India and Germany. Together, these nations were the source of $538 million to illicit markets during 2020 while people there received $403 million, Chainalysis said.

Russians sent around $169 million to the various darknet marketplaces, and received $119 million from such sites. Americans were second, with $115 million sent and $64 million received. In third place, Ukrainians sent $47 million and received $52 million.

“Generally speaking, drugs are grown or manufactured in Latin America and Asia and consumed in North America and Northern & Western Europe,” the report reads. “Darknet vendors and administrators typically launder funds through cryptocurrency services – often over-the-counter (OTC) brokers – in China or Eastern Europe. We can see some of this activity in the blockchain data associated with darknet market transactions.”

Dominant player

The biggest marketplace in the field by far is Hydra, a Russian-language drug marketplace that pocketed 75% of the entire global dark market revenue, Chainalysis said. Hydra was mostly responsible for the rapid growth in the global dark market revenue over the last year, while the income of other marketplaces didn’t change significantly between 2019 and 2020.

Hydra delivers drugs to buyers via “drops,” in which a delivery person hides the purchase close to a buyer and shares the geolocation of the package so it can be collected. In December 2019, Hydra announced it wanted to expand to other regions of the world and would hold a $146 million token sale. This was later put on hold due to the global coronavirus pandemic.

According to the data from Bitfury’s data firm Crystal Blockchain, currently, Hydra’s bitcoin addresses hold more than 521 BTC, worth over $18 million. Since 2011, Hydra has sent and received more than 439,000 BTC ($15.2 billion).

Data limitations

Chainalysis has been researching the various aspects of geography of cryptocurrency use for several years, although the firm admits locating such activity on the globe is a tricky task and such research has its limitations.

To see where in the world crypto markets are most active, Chainalysis looks into such data as web traffic on the particular services via SimilarWeb, time zones in which transactions take place, fiat currencies involved, languages and the location of the headquarters of the services, the firm’s head of research, Kim Grauer, told CoinDesk for a previous report on cryptocurrency adoption around the globe.","['received', 'sent', 'services', 'global', 'report', 'dominate', 'cryptocurrency', 'marketplaces', 'traffic', 'chainalysis', 'hydra', 'dark', 'market', 'million', 'russia']","People in Russia and the U.S. were the source of over $284 million to illicit online marketplaces in 2020, blockchain research firm Chainalysis said in its latest report.
Russia, the U.S., Ukraine and China were the main areas of global money traffic to such platforms.
Together, these nations were the source of $538 million to illicit markets during 2020 while people there received $403 million, Chainalysis said.
Americans were second, with $115 million sent and $64 million received.

In traditional markets, European and Asian shares rose and U.S. stock futures pointed toward a higher open amid renewed optimism for economic stimulus and the distribution of coronavirus vaccines. GameStop shares lost nearly a third of their value on Monday following last week’s 400% short squeeze.

Silver, whose price had shot up to an eight-year high after a series of posts on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum calling for a “short squeeze,” tumbled as some commenters pushed back against the narrative; precious-metals analysts for the lenders HSBC and Commerzbank warned the rally would be hard to sustain. Gold weakened 0.6% to $1,849 an ounce.

Market Moves

With the coronavirus vaccine distribution well underway, Wall Street analysts are sketching out what the economy might look like as 2021 unfolds and social-distancing measures recede.

The short answer is that activity is set to heat up, which could also provide the first real test of the hidden inflationary pressures that might have built up over the past year. Whatever happens will likely prove crucial for the bitcoin market because the cryptocurrency has become one of the most popular ways for big investors to bet on the likelihood of rising prices or dollar debasement.

The U.S. Congressional Budget Office projected on Monday that gross domestic product will expand by 3.7% this year, after a 2.5% contraction in 2020. But Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. lender, is even more optimistic, recently boosting its forecast for this year’s growth to 6%, from 4.5% at the start of the year.

A key question for the inflation watchers, of course, is just how much stimulus money will be pumped into the economy by the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve.

President Joe Biden has proposed a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill, but a group of senators from the opposition Republican party on Monday released details of a $618 billion proposal they argue is more appropriate. Bank of America’s analysts assume the package will end up around $1 trillion.

Why it matters is that as Americans start to get out and about, a surge in consumer spending looks likely. The Bank of America analysts estimate there’s already some $1.6 trillion of excess savings that might start to trickle into the economy.

“The jolt from stimulus, the support of excess savings and the green light from lower virus cases should unleash pent-up consumer spending,” the Bank of America economists wrote. “Stronger growth means a lower unemployment rate and greater inflation pressure.”

That outlook raises the question of how the Fed might respond, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell stating last week that it’s “too early to be talking about dates“ for tapering the central bank’s $120-billion-a-month of bond purchases – funded via printing more money – that are currently ongoing to provide stimulus to financial markets.

By the middle of this year, if the economy is recovering quickly Powell and his colleagues might find it harder to characterize any talk of tapering as still too soon. Because these are typically well-telegraphed affairs, the actual tapering might start six to seven months after that. Call it early 2022.

“We believe the Fed will have difficulty justifying persistently large asset purchases in the face of a sustainable decrease in [COVID-19] cases, economic overheating, and frothy asset prices,” according to Bank of America.

On the other hand, the Fed might flinch.

“We can envision a scenario whereby the Fed signals an intention to taper/starts tapering, markets react negatively, and the Fed finds that they need to continue purchasing or extend the duration of their purchases in order to preserve market functioning,” according to Bank of America.

It’s that latter scenario – or even just the prospect of it – that might drive bitcoin prices a lot higher. Based on the reluctance of central bankers to withdraw stimulus, not to mention the market lurches late last year when a new U.S. stimulus bill seemed in doubt, the scenario isn’t all that implausible.

Bitcoin’s ongoing range play between $30,000 and $40,000 could end with a bullish breakout as demand from investors continues to outstrip new supplies of the cryptocurrency.

In 2021 so far, around 26,000 new bitcoins have been produced by miners on the Bitcoin blockchain, data provider Glassnode said in a weekly report. Yet, in the same period, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has acquired over 40,000 BTC. (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.)

In another bullish indicator, the number of coins held on exchange addresses continues to slide, interpreted as a sign of waning interest from sellers. The balance of bitcoin held across all exchanges fell to a 2.5-year low of 2,349,040 on Monday, according to Glassnode.

On the bearish side, a stronger dollar could play spoilsport to any push higher. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback’s value against major currencies, is looking north, with price charts showing a major bullish pattern known an “inverse head-and-shoulders breakout.”

“If a bullish trend develops from DXY’s latest breakout, it could be a problem for bitcoin,” trader and analyst Alex Kruger told CoinDesk.

The spillover to digital markets from the past week’s GameStop saga has taken on a new form: Soaring demand for digital tokens associated with cryptocurrency exchanges and the arcane but fast-growing arena of decentralized finance, known as DeFi, which could provide an alternative to Wall Street and traditional trading platforms.

“It seems investors are looking for the next trade to cycle through,” Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the cryptocurrency exchange firm EQUOS, wrote Tuesday in a note to clients.

The exchange Binance’s in-house BNB token hit a new all-time high on Monday, just days after rival FTX’s FTT token logged a new record, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reported.

Prices have also hit new highs for tokens from decentralized exchanges, which are essentially just automated, blockchain-based software protocols that can be used to trade digital assets. Uniswap’s UNI and SushiSwap’s SUSHI both saw big price jumps – a dynamic that might reflect retail investors’ growing concerns with centralized trading platforms amid widespread anger over Robinhood’s trading suspensions last week. Trading volumes on the decentralized exchanges,, hit a record above $50 billion in January, CoinDesk’s Zack Voell reported.

Ether, the native blockchain of the Ethereum blockchain, where much of the DeFi development is taking place, has pushed back toward a record high above $1,400.

“Decentralized trading, decentralized lending, decentralized insurance, decentralized everything starts to make a lot more sense in light of what is happening today in the traditional financial system,” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of the cryptocurrency-focused Arca Funds, wrote Monday in his weekly newsletter.

What's Hot

“It’s pretty obvious that the WSB traders are applying the same principles of the digital/CryptoAsset world to the stock market and they are loving the fact that the old schoolers are hating it,” billionaire Mark Cuban writes in a blog post. (CoinDesk)

Coinbase has reportedly tapped Nasdaq for its planned direct listing, according to The Block. Existing Coinbase investors have already been trading shares through Nasdaq’s Private Market platform, where the company has notched an implied valuation of $50 billion.

Winklevosses’ Gemini crypto exchange inks partnership with crypto lender Genesis to give customers option to earn up to 7.4% annual interest on holdings, CoinDesk’s Nathan DiCamillo reported. The new offering aims to lure away customers turned off by “anemic” interest rates from traditional banks, Gemini COO Noah Perlman said. According to DiCamillo, the annual yield is consistent with what’s typically seen among centralized crypto lenders but pales in comparison to yield farming interest rates in decentralized finance (DeFi), which are much higher but more erratic.

The latest on the economy and traditional finance

Robinhood has raised $3.4 billion from investors over the past several days, CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson reported. The online trading platform’s backers are apparently looking past the blowback from Robinhood’s trading suspensions amid the peak of the runup in prices for GameStop, AMC and other “meme stocks.” CFO Jason Warnick said the cash infusion will help Robinhood “scale to meet the incredible growth we’ve seen and demand for our platform.” Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev is expected to testify before the U.S. House of Representatives’ financial-services committee on Feb. 18, CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair reported.

Even before the pandemic hit, global debt was at a far higher level than before the financial crisis of 2008, according to the International Monetary Fund. The figure reached $197 trillion at the end of 2019, for a debt-to-GDP ratio of 226%, according to an International Monetary Fund blog post on Monday. That compares with a ratio of 193% in 2007. But because of unusually accommodative monetary policies (i.e., interest rates set at close to zero or even negative levels), the average debt expense as a share of revenue was 0.3 percentage points lower in 2019, according to the IMF. With U.S. government debt alone rising by about $4 trillion to about $27 trillion, the year-end 2020 numbers are likely to look a lot uglier.

In short, it brings a combination of bank-grade custody and post-trade settlement to crypto.

“There is very little institutional-grade infrastructure within digital. In fact, I’m gobsmacked at how little there is,” said Cobalt Chairman Adrian Patten. “Also, I’ve noticed that in the crypto world everyone concentrates on the coin, the crypto bit. They forget the dollar. Whether that’s from a risk management perspective, management of collateral or settlement, that’s always the thing that holds them back.”

Specifically, the partnership involves integrating METACO’s institutional operating system for digital assets, SILO, with Cobalt’s interoperable FX and digital assets platform to offer a fully integrated end-to-end SaaS solution for the storage, limit allocation and intraday settlement of digital assets, per a press release.

“There’s a lot of friction in the market still,” said Seamus Donoghue, VP of sales and business development at METACO. “When you trade on exchanges or with counterparts in general, you have to pre-fund those positions. That’s capital intensive. There’s a counterparty risk there as well, and it’s just not a very efficient market.”

BBVA, StanChart and more

Between them the two firms have a hand in most of the major crypto banking plays happening in Europe right now. METACO is working on crypto custody with Standard Chartered, BBVA, DBS Bank and Gazprombank Switzerland. Cobalt is also involved with Standard Chartered and has other projects in the pipeline involving the likes of ErisX and LMAX Digital.

Cobalt’s Patten pointed out that banks and many regulated buy-side firms need certain processes and ways of doing things. “You can’t go settling a transaction on the back of emails. Which is what happens,” he said.

But it’s not just institutions looking for better digital asset trading infrastructure. Many of the largest crypto exchanges are in talks with the firms too, Patten said.

“Over 75% of our pipeline is crypto firms looking to upgrade their processes,” Patten said. “They’re having massive increases of volume and volatility, and they realize you can’t carry on doing it in this way. We’re going to be signing a bunch of these firms up in the first quarter.”","['patten', 'settlement', 'assets', 'exchanges', 'trading', 'upgrade', 'thats', 'metaco', 'infrastructure', 'cobalt', 'firms', 'crypto', 'banks', 'digital']","Announced Tuesday, METACO and Cobalt are launching a software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering that covers the full gamut of institutional trading requirements for digital assets.

The product is offered in all 50 states, including New York where Gemini has its trust license. Users can get yield on any cryptocurrency available on the Gemini platform now and on Gemini’s GUSD stablecoin at some point in the future. The product is open to active Gemini customers currently and will be rolled out to all Gemini customers later this month.

Gemini collects part of the spread between interest paid on the crypto and interest Genesis charges on its loans to institutions.

Melvin Capital, the $8 billion hedge fund that didn’t find GameStop (GME) funny, lost 53% of its portfolio in January ($7 billion) trying to short against the rallying cries of the Reddit Capitalist Union. Founder Gabe Plotkin also faces the embarrassment of having to get bailed out by his old boss.

Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter.

Speaking of, Steven A Cohen, New York Mets baseball team owner and former name-on-the-door of SAC Capital (known most recently for its insider trading fine of $1.8 billion), put $2.8 billion of capital into Melvin’s fund.

Ken Griffin, owner of the Citadel hedge fund (an investor in Melvin), and Citadel Securities (a massive market maker and buyer-of-order-flow for Robinhood), is seeing capital losses in the former and Washington, D.C., cries for scrutiny into market structure in regards to the latter.

Robinhood itself – which, for goodness sake, is not Wall Street but as Silicon Valley as it possibly gets – raised $1 billion immediately to protect itself from class-action lawsuits, DTCC capital calls and a now-rapidly closing IPO window. That means Yuri Milner of DST Global chipping in yet again.

That’s at least four people that have had a very bad, no good day.

The Reddit WallStreetBets army has eight million members. Robinhood has 13 million users. These are the opposing forces. They are, loosely speaking, having a pretty good day.

This isn’t about how much money you have. This is about a mindset and a framing of the world. It’s about who you are and who you are not.

But other billionaires are having way more fun. The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, is raising the crypto rallying flag and ex-Facebook billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya is trading along with Reddit for quick profits, decentralized hedge fund and all. This isn’t about how much money you have. This is about a mindset and a framing of the world. It’s about who you are and who you are not. And it’s about what you did and did not do.

Do you side with the internet’s gamer heroes, wearing Nyan cat shirts and crying out sarcastically for “moar Stonks, money printer go brrrr, number go up”! A post-Gawker-4chan swirl of human vectors, coalescing into one giant middle finger to every Karen and Ken? Dopamine splashing out from our pituitary glands into a vortex tornado of well-earned resentment.

Or, do you like your finance suited, ministerial, administrative and gated? Do you think it is storied, respectable and important. That you have to go to HYP and then do your “two and two” at Goldman and HBS before hopping to KKR or Tiger or SAC and then into your own cozy fund? All that work, all that sweat for the GMAT and the SAT and the bootlicking, to be undone by someone literally making fun of you in the language of money.

See also: Jill Carlson – GameStop and the Real Market Manipulators

It’s not about some truth about Wall Street or Silicon Valley or the internet or bitcoin or decentralized finance (DeFi) and least of all about GameStop (GME). Those are just flags of our armies. And we are at war with ourselves.

GameStop is a mall shop that sold video games. The mall shops that rented videos (Blockbuster) or sold books (Borders) are bankrupt and rightly dead. The internet, and its children Netflix and Amazon, killed them. And yet, their names are etched into the collective childhood memories of millions. GameStop has no chance against Steam or Epic – both brands that are also deeply loved by nerds all over the world. We say this as self-incrimination. And yet, GameStop is a symbol, a feeling, a reminiscence.

The person building financial models and analyzing this stuff according to economics is “right” to point out bad things about “fundamentals” of the business. Within the game of financial capital markets, the fundamentals are the gears of the economic machines that you evaluate with capital decisions. You buy good fundamentals, says Warren Buffett and you sell bad ones. Another Warren, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, also believes in fundamentals. She believes in them so much she wants the government to regulate them into the market and “fair, orderly and efficient function.”

All that might be right, and we are not doubting the wisdom of John Maynard Keynes or the animal spirits. But Warren Buffett is no longer number one. It’s an Elon Musk world now.

Fundamentals are what the financial doctors will tell you that you have. Do you think the internet cares about their diagnosis? No. The internet cares about being patronized by people in coats. Musk and Chamath are the mushrooms of the internet. It is in their DNA.

The GameStop trade itself is worth a pause. While some of the original thinking by DeepF**kingValue that led to his $30+ million capital gain reflected on the GameStop business, the core insight was market structure. The trade was not about GameStop beating its analyst estimates or any of that boring-play-by-the-rules stuff. It was about a short squeeze. It was about restricting the supply of the stock in such a way as to blow up a levered short bet that Melvin Capital was putting into play.

In other words, we are talking about the meta-game, not the grunt Excel spreadsheet game. SAC, Tiger, Point72, Melvin Capital and every other hedge fund worth its salt plays the meta-game. That’s the whole point. You get a PhD in financial instruments by doing the work and testing the levers rather than believing in them blindly. And WallStreetBets dared to play the meta-game as well. Retail investors aren’t supposed to self-organize into a hive-mind of levered derivatives strategy driven by spite. And here we are.

To go short, Melvin has to borrow. To borrow, you have to pay an interest rate. To cover your short, you have to buy back the stock. You’re paying an interest rate and have to buy back the stock. Nobody is selling you the stock, because they hate you. Everyone is buying, to troll you specifically. They are levering up with options. And you keep raising your bids until you cover your position.

Robinhood is a broker/dealer. It came into being in Silicon Valley, a place where consumer services are free because they are actually not services but honeypots that aggregate user demand, package it at large scale and re-sell attention to advertisers. Such is Facebook and Google. Our lives are better because of these services, but also compromised and profoundly insane.

Robinhood uses this playbook to aggregate consumer demand with the honeypot of free trading, and then sends it to market makers like Citadel Securities and gets paid $600 million for the orders. TD Ameritrade and eTrade and other discount brokers do this, too! But Robinhood does it most, and does it best. Check out our prior explanation with Paul Rowady here.

There is nothing unusually nefarious going on. It is just American capital markets structure and a clever lead-generation arbitrage. That is, if customers are still getting best-execution with Citadel. But the structure is ancient by modern technology standards, and far from real-time. It takes two days for a trade to settle, and this among other reasons leads to a requirement of capital to be placed with a “clearing house,” in this case the DTCC. Given the volatility in GameSpot caused by the internet trying to break a hedge fund the way George Soros broke the Bank of England, capital requirements skyrocketed tenfold.

Robinhood, as well as TD Ameritrade, ended up restricting trading in the instrument as a result of this capital call. If you are burning and raising a billion dollars per year, you probably don’t have a “tenfold” of cash lying around to give to the DTCC to make it feel comfy. So, you know, it just removed the “Buy” button for a whole bunch of crusaders on a mission with their capital on the line. They didn’t remove the “Sell” button, thereby throwing fire on the internet conspiracy meme machine.

Was this done on instruction from Citadel billionaires? Was this the banksters colluding against the common person? Was “Wall Street” trying to take away our constitutional freedom to trade on a mobile app? Even U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez found common ground in finding someone to blame!

It’s not a lot of rioters yet.

But remember, fintech – including Robinhood, Revolut, SoFi and the rest – is supposed to democratize access to financial services. That meant very little a decade ago, and “dumb money” was disorganized and uninformed. Now, information is free and available to all. Equities trading is largely costless and frictionless. And the scariest part, for the suited part of finance anyway, is that strength lies in numbers and can now self-organize.

In addition to this, we have the crypto currency ecosystem. Unlike fintech, which went after distribution, blockchain goes after manufacturing. If you are a trader or market maker on Ethereum, there is no clearinghouse. There is no broker/dealer. There is only you and the distributed machine with its smart contracts, automated rule sets and software-enforced property rights. All data is real-time. The blocks click into being one after another without a single lawyerly piece of paper in sight. Hundreds of millions of people in the world have touched this asset class and it renders financial intermediaries unnecessary in their imagination.

Now don’t get us wrong. A trade on Ethereum is going to cost you $10 to $100 today, and another 1% in slippage. It is going to cost you some immeasurable but ever-present probability of cyber risk and regulatory overhang. But you nobody can take away your “Buy” or “Sell” button, and the speed and scale issues are mere technical problems to be solved by the entrepreneurial gods.

Here’s the rub, post-fintech-crypto-democratization and all.

Humans are social animals. It is in our bones. The concept of fairness has been selected through the evolutionary filter and fueled a cooperation-based multi-billion person civilization.

Democracy is not oligarchy. Democracy means each person has one vote. If you were to vote according to assets under management, which is how finance has done it to date, you get very different outcomes than when you vote person by person. Now we have a set of promises and representation from companies like Robinhood that suggest a democratic empowerment of individuals to access the storied products of finance. Most people don’t know, or want to know, how the actual machine works. When the promises have a gap to reality, because of whatever reason, this creates kinetic energy for Twitter and Reddit.

It creates energy for people in the position of leverage who understand the machine, and want it to change. Elon Musk hates short-sellers for their damping, and perhaps manipulating, effect on his promises of Tesla greatness. Certainly Chamath, having launched endless SPACs to take Silicon Valley fintech distributors like SoFi public, understands the machine as well. For them, this tear in the fabric of reality is a power. It is a rallying cry.

Retail investors aren’t supposed to self-organize into a hive-mind of levered derivatives strategy driven by spite. And here we are.

If we really want to put this into dystopian context, let’s at least reference the theory of overcrowding elites from Peter Turchin. The historian eerily predicted the 2020 rioting and disaffection back in 2010, suggesting that societies fall apart when they over-produce members of the ruling class. Education has minted PhDs, MBAs and entrepreneurs who have no seat to inherit from a retiring predecessor. As a result, they take on the populist mantle and position themselves as outsiders to attack the insiders, while of course being fabulously gifted. Thus Donald Trump and all the rest.

If you are holding power today you probably don’t want everything to fall apart just because Redditors hate a caricatured notion of hedge funds. So you tweak things at the edges. Edit out the glitches in the current matrix. It is through this lens that we see Google deleting 100,000 negative Robinhood reviews for being “inauthentic.”

Of course they were coordinated. But they were very authentic to the people who wrote them. They were, however, “inauthentic” to the current rule-set of the game. Based on fundamentals, market structure and a variety of other “this is how things work” explanations, Robinhood did nothing wrong. Nor did Melvin, really, as far as we can tell from the media coverage. It just played a game that has become a cartoon that millions of people despise. Google’s app store is also an incumbent, a rule-set as well of what constitutes good behavior and what you should do according to its Terms, and so on. Protecting Robinhood’s reputation because it did not fundamentally err is what you do when you believe the current system works.","['capital', 'hedge', 'sokolin', 'robinhood', 'old', 'tech', 'cant', 'billion', 'fund', 'financial', 'democratize', 'using', 'market', 'person', 'finance', 'gamestop', 'internet']","The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, is raising the crypto rallying flag and ex-Facebook billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya is trading along with Reddit for quick profits, decentralized hedge fund and all.
Within the game of financial capital markets, the fundamentals are the gears of the economic machines that you evaluate with capital decisions.
SAC, Tiger, Point72, Melvin Capital and every other hedge fund worth its salt plays the meta-game.
But remember, fintech – including Robinhood, Revolut, SoFi and the rest – is supposed to democratize access to financial services.
Based on fundamentals, market structure and a variety of other “this is how things work” explanations, Robinhood did nothing wrong."

Chaos ensued. Retail traders everywhere cried foul, accusing the startup brokerage of protecting hedge funds and the establishment at their expense. U.S. politicians across the spectrum, from Rep. AOC to Sen. Ted Cruz, came together to lambast the move on Twitter. Venture capitalists and technologists called into question the morality of Robinhood’s founders and proclaimed that the moment for decentralization had finally arrived.

Robinhood did not halt trading of GameStop to punish the insurgent mass of retail traders. Nor did it do so out of a paternalistic impulse to try to protect them. Robinhood halted trading of GameStop because it had to, thanks to a set of standards put in place by market players upstream. Robinhood’s clearing firm, the company that facilitates the settlement of the broker-dealer’s trades, could not keep up with the risk it was being asked to take on.

Jill Carlson, a CoinDesk columnist, is co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, a non-profit research organization working to guarantee the right to a free and open financial system. She is also an investor in early-stage startups with Slow Ventures.

Clearing firms exist in part to mitigate the consequences should a broker-dealer fail to meet its obligations. Clearing firms therefore need to keep a tight handle on risk. This means they need to put up more money to make good on trades as markets get whackier and whackier (that is, as volatility increases). The GameStop market was about as whacky as it gets. The clearing firm couldn’t take on any more risk. Robinhood couldn’t fork over any more funds to the clearing firm. The music had to stop.

These are precisely the type of controls that became so clearly important in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis: strict risk management, transparency, liquidity thresholds, and capital requirements. These standards were designed to prevent reckless behavior and to mitigate the fallout should a financial firm become overexposed. When retail traders demanded these rules be implemented on big institutions 10 years ago, they couldn’t have imagined those rules would someday shut them out of the market.

Yesterday highlights the importance of understanding all of the boring nuances of trading back offices and the standards, rules, regulations and protocols that go along with them. Settling a trade takes two days. Thus, clearing firms have two days of exposure to their counterparty firm.

Why does it take two days? People love to say this is a technology issue and that innovations like blockchains can fix this. The reality is, as with so many things that people claim blockchains can fix that this issue is almost entirely one of process and regulation. Perhaps new technology can be a catalyst to revisit these, but it is certainly not the limiting factor.

The Securities and Exchange Commission mandates settlement periods for securities to keep processes among counterparties running smoothly. There are plenty of short-term securities that do settle the same day like certificates of deposit and commercial paper. Equities take as long as they do in part because of historical precedent, dating from the times when technology was indeed the constraint. Every financial institution became accustomed to the processes involved in multi-day settlement periods. Financial institutions are generally slowly evolving creatures, meaning that which they are used to is that which they prefer. Because their processes are built around multi-day settlement, they continue to choose multi-day settlement. The solution to this is not a blockchain anymore than it is a centralized database.

Robinhood halted trading of GameStop because it had to, thanks to a set of standards put in place by market players upstream.

It is so tempting to turn these conversations into conversations about technology. If only we had a decentralized financial trading platform, we would be saved from the censorship imposed by Robinhood or clearing firms or the SEC, the thinking goes. If only we had equities on a blockchain, we would be saved from two day settlement periods and the risks and inefficiencies they impose.

But the issues lie not with the technology. They lie with the way the protocols, processes, rules and laws around the market were designed. And these kinds of issues do not go away no matter how decentralized your trading venue is or how many blockchains you are using.

There are, to be sure, many archaic and obsolete practices that those in charge of the markets continue to adhere to. But it is all too easy to blindly rail against these or to blame them on technology without examining where these practices came from or why they exist. In the most extreme cases, these processes prevail for risk management reasons. In more innocuous cases, these practices simply emerged from the human behavior of those interacting with the markets.

When XRP was de-platformed earlier this month by Coinbase and many others there was not a sudden rush of liquidity and activity on decentralized exchanges that list the asset. That is because traders did not want to touch the asset given the regulatory concerns around the asset.

Take also the question of whether markets should be open and active 24 hours, 7 days per week, 365 days per year. This is another area where I frequently hear people saying that new technology would resolve this, pointing to cryptocurrency markets that are always open. But there are already plenty of mainstream markets that are always open. All over-the-counter markets work this way on Wall Street. If I want to do an over-the-counter trade, I can theoretically call up a market maker any time and ask for a price. In all likelihood, though, I don’t want to. I want to wait for times when there is liquidity.

So much of how the financial market works is based on historical human behaviors, either codifying them into market standards or erecting guardrails against their natural tendencies. To be sure, developments of the last weeks and years demonstrate that many of these policies and procedures are worth revisiting. Cryptocurrency markets have proven that there might be demand for 24/7 markets, at least in some asset classes. GameStop has shown that certain retail broker-dealers might need to be better capitalized to anticipate the kind of groundswell behavior we have seen this week.","['settlement', 'standards', 'markets', 'technology', 'carlson', 'trading', 'financial', 'problem', 'jill', 'stop', 'clearing', 'market', 'gamestop', 'risk']","Robinhood did not halt trading of GameStop to punish the insurgent mass of retail traders.

This was the week the internet finally defeated Wall Street – at least for a few days. The wild rally in GameStop’s stock, fueled by an army of Reddit retail day traders, imposed devastating losses on hedge funds and showed how free trading tools and social media (memes) can now be harnessed by networks of individuals to achieve economic outcomes previously controlled by elites. The gobsmacking story of GameStop, Melvin Capital and r/WallStreetbets was tailor-made for the disruptive, anti-establishment vibe of the crypto community. This “WSB effect” theme runs throughout this week’s newsletter.

On the other side of the masses vs. establishment divide, this was also the week of the “Davos Agenda” virtual event, held in lieu of the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting. It included the likes of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Chinese President Xi Zinping, a host of Fortune 500 CEOs and so forth.

My podcast co-host Sheila Warren, who happens to be the WEF’s blockchain lead, invited long-time WEF Managing Director Adrian Monck to this week’s “Money Reimagined” show. We talked directly about how the old guard deals with the changes that radical outsiders, such as crypto developers and tribes of activist retail investors, present.

BTC and ETH: Made for each other

As of 11:00 a.m. ET Friday, the year-to-date returns for bitcoin and ether show an easily discernible reversal of the BTC dominance seen in late 2020. Bitcoin is up 27% year to date and ether, 92%.

What’s going on here? Well, before we try to answer that, a caveat: If the past week’s WallStreetBets-vs-hedge funds spectacle has taught us anything, it’s that in today’s meme-consuming, radically democratizing markets, confidently defining fundamental reasons for price movements is difficult. What matters is which narrative is winning.

Well, before we try to answer that, a caveat: If the past week’s WallStreetBets-vs-hedge funds spectacle has taught us anything, it’s that in today’s meme-consuming, radically democratizing markets, confidently defining fundamental reasons for price movements is difficult. What matters is which narrative is winning. Narrative? So prices are just make-believe? Well, yes, but stories have always been about how people – and thus markets – reach consensus. It used to be Wall Street controlled the narrative. It’s unclear whether that’s still the case.

Well, yes, but stories have always been about how people – and thus markets – reach consensus. It used to be Wall Street controlled the narrative. It’s unclear whether that’s still the case. So, what narrative best explains ETH outperforming BTC? Well, let’s first challenge the “Tulip Bubble” angle that mainstream crypto critics might instinctively apply here: The idea this is a rerun of the 2017 bitcoin rally, which pushed speculators into comparatively cheaper tokens only to foster the mother of all bubbles. The loss suffered this week by short-selling hedge funds at the expense of hordes of retail investors from the r/WallStreetBets subreddit shows it’s dangerous to conclude that large groups of determined bulls are inherently wrong.



This is not to say ETH’s price won’t correct as bitcoin’s has this month. It just means we owe it to ourselves to explore other narratives.

This is not to say ETH’s price won’t correct as bitcoin’s has this month. It just means we owe it to ourselves to explore other narratives. Such as? Here’s one: There’s a BTC-to-ETH price rotation going on that suggests thoughtful investors are starting to see Ethereum, and more specifically the decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built on it, as a constructive complement to Bitcoin. As sophisticated investors increasingly recognize bitcoin’s potential as a “digital gold” store of wealth, the thesis goes, they will soon see DeFi as a means to creatively unlock that value – for payments, for loans, for insurance, and so forth.



This take sees Bitcoin as the base layer protocol for a software stack that handles the internet’s value storage and exchange. Bitcoin the currency is a simple yet hard-to-change, highly secure store of value. Much like gold, it doesn’t do much; you just lock it away and use it as security to back up your other investments and financial activity. But because it’s built on a permissionless protocol, developers can still do many more creative things with it than, say, a gold custodian can do with bullion.



That’s where Ethereum and DeFi come in. With smart contracts, oracles, decentralized exchanges and multi-sig systems for securing digital assets, the degens of DeFi are now incorporating bitcoin into their freewheeling, “composable” world of decentralized financial products. Hence the summer explosion of wrapped bitcoin tokens such as WBTC.



To go back to the software stack analogy, Ethereum is middleware and DeFi occupies the application layer.

(Moe Na/CoinDesk)

Analogies are also being made to the traditional finance “stack.” RealVision CEO Raoul Pal says bitcoin is “pristine collateral” that could even take on the $123 trillion market for U.S. Treasury bonds as the base-level security for all credit. It’s appeal is not only that it’s a provably scarce asset, but also that it can be locked up in escrow through a decentralized smart contract that leaves neither lenders nor borrowers vulnerable to the failures of a middleman. You build DeFi’s lending, borrowing and insuring products on top of that feature and you now have the makings of a financial system.

Asked by CoinDesk contributor Jeff Wilser if he would ever see bitcoin as something more than a speculative investment, Dallas Mavericks owner and CNBC “Shark Tank” personality Mark Cuban responded, “Sure. If DeFi and BTC can evolve together in a manner that allows BTC to effectively be a bank account without the bank. That creates utility for BTC.” What does he think of Ethereum? “I like ETH. Obviously it’s a primary foundation for DeFi, and we will see what happens with ETH 2.”

Obviously it’s a primary foundation for DeFi, and we will see what happens with ETH 2.” Ah, Eth 2. The Elephant in the Room. If Ethereum 2.0 succeeds, over the next couple of years the blockchain will transition from a proof-of-work consensus model to proof-of-stake and will allow massively more transaction-processing capability. That scalability is needed if Ethereum is to play a meaningful role in the global financial system. But the transition is incredibly difficult to pull off within a large, decentralized community of users where billions of dollars are at stake.



Still, there seems to be early optimism around Eth 2.0. The amount of ether locked and staked on the transitional Beacon Chain has steadily risen to more than 2.8 million ETH as of Wednesday (an amount currently worth about $3.89 billion). Indeed, ether’s steady January gain to an all-time high of $1,476.12 on Sunday was itself an expression of confidence in that project.

There’s a boom in non-fungible tokens, also captured in the Cuban interview. And there’s support, including from suddenly in-the-news social media platform Reddit, for using so-called layer 2 scaling solutions such as Plasma to expand Ethereum’s use cases. Meanwhile, EY blockchain lead Paul Brody is predicting financial institutions will bring DeFi to the masses.



All of this points to an expanding and diversifying Ethereum ecosystem. For a blockchain, that’s the best story you can tell: a growing network.

Did Trump help bitcoin’s late-2020 surge?

Since we’re talking about narratives, let’s look at how we might visually represent a market-justifying story. I’ve chosen a take by CoinDesk Global News Editor Kevin Reynolds on the role played by fears of electoral chaos on bitcoin’s price rise during the late fall and early winter. I can buy this story: If bitcoin is digital gold, it should work as a backstop against dystopia. But what I also found interesting was how easy it was to illustrate this idea on a chart. I just grabbed a few election-related statements by former President Donald Trump and his supporters, got CoinDesk data visualizer Shuai Hao to mark them on a four-month chart from our subsidiary company TradeBlock and the yellow line did the rest.

TradeBlock XBX (Shuai Hao/CoinDesk) Source: https://tradeblock.com/markets/index

(NOTE: This chart was produced late Thursday New York time, before bitcoin’s huge leap to a new post-Jan. 8 high of $38,000 early Friday morning. The story may need a new chapter. Arrival of the WSB effect?)

Kevin argues that electoral fear added an extra $10,000 to the all-time high that was hit right after the climactic Jan. 6 raid on Congress. The rest of the gains came from the standard stuff everyone was talking about: mainly that institutional investors were now adding bitcoin to their long-term portfolios. So, when things simmered down and new President Joseph Biden was sworn in, bitcoin’s price eased to what would be fair value in normal times – you know, amid a normal global pandemic and economic depression.

The Conversation: Ants vs. elephants

In 2014, when the idea of decentralized autonomous organizations was first being kicked around, crypto pioneer and DAO enthusiast Joel Dietz founded a decentralized fundraising platform called “Swarm.” (It has since evolved into Swarm Capital, which provides tools for companies to issue security tokens.) The name always struck me as an evocative one for an entity comprising many individuals without centralized control.

Now, after digesting this heady week on Wall Street, the term seems especially apt. I’m talking, of course, about how retail investors in a Subreddit that quickly swelled to 4.4 million people collectively forced big hedge funds into a “short squeeze” on supposedly has-been “meme stocks” such as GameStop, AMC Entertainment and BlackBerry. The WSB group maneuver imposed billions of dollars of losses on those institutions. Melvin Capital needed an injection of $2.75 billion from Citadel and Point72. One thinks of a swarm of ants attacking elephants.

That the name stems from a crypto venture is also fitting since the WSB saga prompted an outpouring of interest from the crypto community. It had all the elements of a crypto drama, even though the battle never occurred on a blockchain.

For one, there was a much-discussed CNBC interview with Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya, who had spent time trawling through the r/WallStreetBets posts and, following the group’s lead, made a $500,000 profit. Declaring that what he “learned over the last couple of days is important for everybody that’s watching CNBC,” Chamath said the insurgent investor movement was “a pushback against the establishment in a very important way,” one that harked back to the 2008 financial crisis. It captured the rebellious, anti-Wall Street vibe that’s long been part of the crypto community.

As the drama unfolded, Crypto Twitter lit up with people drawing parallels with and lessons about the crypto scene.

In a tweet thread about people demanding change to a system rigged for the big guys, Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz said the movement was “a giant endorsement of DeFi.”

Then, on Thursday, when the Redditors’ favored trading app, Robinhood, shut down access to the the stocks in question – creating a vitriolic backlash in what one observer called the trading app’s own “Streisand Effect” – the crypto community leapt to remind the world that this could never happen on a decentralized exchange. It was the perfect opportunity for Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift, to weigh in about his company’s new decentralized offering.

Then, inevitably, the WSB phenomenon spread into the crypto world’s very own “meme token,” Dogecoin, which soared more than 800% to a new record high.

CoinDesk’s own Will Foxley couldn’t resist:

Going into the year-end was an exciting period for bitcoiners. Many large-name investors emerged to declare their appreciation of bitcoin’s potential and the price responded accordingly.

As the price dropped back in the latter part of January, the “institutions are coming” rallying cry tempered. Big-name investors still showed interest in bitcoin, but some of their messages emphasized their caution and focused on the challenges they still see bitcoin facing before it attains a widely recognized place in institutional portfolios. CoinDesk’s coverage this past week captured that. (We’ll have to see how next week’s stories look if bitcoin holds the gains it enjoyed Friday morning and as these institutions take stock of the powerful reckoning they’ve been confronted via a retail investor insurrection.)

Guggenheim Partners Chief Investment Officer Scott Minerd, who made waves last year when he assigned a long-term target of $400,000 to bitcoin, didn’t exactly retract that prediction but added an implicit “not any time soon” caveat. In a Bloomberg interview he said, “Right now, the reality of the institutional demand that would support a $35,000 price or even a $30,000 price is just not there.” After Friday’s jump, that comment is looking a little off.

Journalists are always looking for comments from Dallas Mavericks owner and CNBC “Shark Tank” personality Marc Cuban. Crypto journalists are no exception. So, we were thrilled that CoinDesk contributor Jeff Wilser had a rich exchange with Cuban this week. As discussed above, Cuban sees real potential in bitcoin, especially if it can team up with DeFi. But as a standalone investment for now, his current view is, let’s say, “meh.”

We’ve also long been trying to get legendary Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio’s thoughts on bitcoin. He has remained mostly skeptical, even if his tone has become moderately more upbeat over time and his view has emerged only via small snippets of commentary. Finally, in his widely read Daily Observations newsletter, Dalio and his team have delivered a detailed, deep-dive analysis of bitcoin’s opportunities and challenges. I’d say Dalio still has a small amount of learning to do – for example, on why bitcoin can’t easily be replaced by a “better” cryptocurrency – but otherwise this is a brilliant analysis. His team’s assessment of bitcoin’s infamous volatility and why that makes it hard for portfolio managers to adopt it as loss-mitigating uncorrelated asset is masterful. (Oh, and I’m super excited to tell you that Dalio will be a headline keynote at CoinDesk’s Consensus event in May. Stay tuned for more exciting speaker announcements as we update the events page.)

Perhaps the most important news of the week on the institutional investor side was Ian Allison’s scoop that the trustees who run the endowments of Harvard, Yale, Brown and other universities have been investing in bitcoin for over a year. What we need to know is why. The colleges are, for now, keeping the justification for their entry into this market close to their chest. Without that, it’s hard to know whether they’ll keep it up.","['price', 'eth', 'decentralized', 'bitcoin', 'week', 'cant', 'investors', 'defi', 'narratives', 'bitcoins', 'street', 'crypto', 'wall', 'control', 'ethereum', 'michael', 'casey']","This was the week the internet finally defeated Wall Street – at least for a few days.

Bitcoin’s algorithmically determined rate of increase certainly makes it scarce when demand for the bitcoin cryptocurrency is rising, though not so much when it is falling. Furthermore, the fact that the algorithm provides for bitcoin’s supply to stop increasing about 120 years from now means that its supply is finite. Unless the code is changed (and that raises questions about what “Bitcoin” even means), there can never be more than 21 million bitcoins.

As I will show, however, bitcoin’s scarcity doesn’t stem from its finite nature, but from potentially infinite – though fickle – demand. And its legendary volatility is linked less to its scarcity or its finite nature and more to its inherent inflexibility. These distinctions may sound slight, but I argue they amount to important revisions of our understanding of this technology.

Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book, “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing,” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.

Scarcity is hardly unique to bitcoin. All assets are scarce. Indeed anything that has a price is scarce, by definition. If there is no scarcity, there is no price. Things that are so abundant that everyone can have all they want are free, even if they are objectively valuable to humans. Air, for example, is free, though it is so valuable to humans that we can’t exist without it.

Price is the mechanism by which markets equilibrate the supply of, and demand for, scarce objects. When there is more demand for a product than supply, the price rises until demand falls sufficiently for supply to be adequate. This means some people’s demand for the product will be partly or completely unsatisfied. In a free market, it is normal – indeed necessary – for people to be priced out of the market.

Conversely, when there is a greater supply of a product than demand, its price falls until demand rises sufficiently to mop up the excess. In retail markets, price falls might take the form of discounting and special offers.

Sometimes there is no demand for a product at any price, even a negative one. “You can’t pay people to take it away,” as the saying goes. There may be a limited supply of these things no one wants, but it is ridiculous to call them “scarce.” There are far too many of them. When there is an over-supply of a product, it becomes not simply worthless but costly to the holder because it incurs storage and disposal charges.

This brings me to what I regard as the fundamental problem with the definition of scarcity used by Bitcoin’s advocates. They confuse “scarce” with finite. It’s not necessary for something to have a fixed supply for it to be scarce; and things whose supply is constantly increasing are not necessarily abundant.

The passenger pigeon

To illustrate the difference between abundant, scarce and finite, let’s consider the sad story of the passenger pigeon, a bird once native to the U.S. but now extinct.

Back in the 19th century, passenger pigeons were so abundant that observers described them as “darkening the sky” in flight. They were a serious nuisance to crops but a free source of meat and eggs. So people were paid to kill them.

See also: Frances Coppola – Banks Are Toast but Crypto Has Lost Its Soul

As people killed passenger pigeons by the millions and destroyed their forest breeding grounds, their numbers crashed. Lawmakers did not believe that something so abundant could ever become scarce, so attempts to protect the bird with legislation failed, The carnage continued and the species went into terminal decline.

The last wild bird is thought to have been shot in 1901. The birds survived in zoos for a few more years, but breeding proved impossible. The last passenger pigeon, Martha, died in the Cincinnati Zoo on Sept. 1, 1914. She was (and remains, since after her death she was stuffed) a bird of infinite value, the last of her kind and the icon of her species.

While passenger pigeons still existed in the wild, their supply was not finite. They nested, laid eggs and brought up chicks. But the rate at which they reproduced could not keep up with the rate at which humans were destroying them, so they became scarce. If humans had stopped shooting them and stealing their eggs, their supply would have increased again. In contrast, if bitcoins are lost, they can never be replaced. The supply is permanently reduced. So bitcoins are finite, but the passenger pigeon was not.

Bitcoin is therefore intrinsically volatile, not because of its scarcity or its finite nature, but because of its inflexibility.

The passenger pigeon became scarce not because it had a finite supply, but because demand for it far exceeded the rate at which its supply was increasing. And because humans refused to believe it was becoming scarce, its price failed to rise to match supply and demand. The “stickiness” of the passenger pigeon’s zero price ensured its demise. This is a type of market failure known as the “tragedy of the commons.” As Joni Mitchell sang, “You don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone.”

Towards its end, the passenger pigeon became both scarce and finite because it would not breed in captivity. That ultimately is why it became extinct. But had the zoos been able to establish successful breeding programs, the passenger pigeon would not have been finite. It might still be with us today. And like all endangered species, it would now be protected by law. Endangered species aren’t finite but they are so scarce and valuable that people risk their lives to protect them.

So it is not a finite supply that creates scarcity. It is a persistent excess of demand over supply. In a well-functioning market, if demand for a product rises faster than its supply, its price will rise even though its supply is increasing.

For some kinds of good, there are natural limits to demand: Everyone needs water, but there is a limit to how much water people can drink. However, drinkable water is scarce and the population is growing. Even if the supply of drinkable water increases, therefore, it will remain scarce as long as the rate of increase is the same or lower than the rate of increase of the population.

But for other types of good, such as gold and bitcoin, demand is potentially insatiable. The price of these things should therefore rise continually even if the supply is uncapped and continually increasing, provided the rate of increase is not so great that people lose interest. So it’s possible to continually create more of something without making it so abundant that it becomes worthless.

What this means for bitcoin

And this brings me back to bitcoin. Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap does not make it scarce. After all, 21 million of things no one wants is abundance (or “oversupply”), not scarcity. Like every asset, bitcoin is scarce when demand for it exceeds the available supply. When demand crashes, as it did in 2014 and 2018, bitcoin can’t really be said to be scarce, even though the supply hasn’t increased. However, Bitcoin’s supply algorithm does affect the price because it makes it impossible for bitcoin’s supply to respond to demand. Just as passenger pigeons couldn’t increase their rate of reproduction to compensate for the rate at which humans were killing them, so Bitcoin can’t increase or reduce its rate of production to compensate for changes in demand for bitcoins. And in a well-functioning market, when supply can’t respond to demand, the price must adjust.","['price', 'coppola', 'passenger', 'rethinking', 'supply', 'frances', 'demand', 'finite', 'bitcoins', 'scarce', 'scarcity', 'bitcoin', 'rate']","Furthermore, the fact that the algorithm provides for bitcoin’s supply to stop increasing about 120 years from now means that its supply is finite.
As I will show, however, bitcoin’s scarcity doesn’t stem from its finite nature, but from potentially infinite – though fickle – demand.
This brings me to what I regard as the fundamental problem with the definition of scarcity used by Bitcoin’s advocates.
But for other types of good, such as gold and bitcoin, demand is potentially insatiable.
However, Bitcoin’s supply algorithm does affect the price because it makes it impossible for bitcoin’s supply to respond to demand."

The cryptocurrency almost doubled in value over the weekend and clocked a two-month high earlier today. The price action suggests some traders bought XRP in anticipation of a price pump, inadvertently pushing it higher. Some of them may now be trapped on the wrong side of the market.

At press time, the exact reason for the price dump is not known. It’s quite possible that a whale (large investor) took advantage of the price rise and dumped his holdings. Pump and dump strategies are not new to crypto markets, particularly for XRP.

A Reddit post, which talked about a crowd-buying attack at 08:30 and how it could be successful, has now been removed by Ripple moderators.

XRP rose to a high of $0.6836 during European trading hours, its highest level since Nov. 25, extending the weekend’s rally from $0.27 to $0.50, according to CoinDesk 20 data. As a result, the cryptocurrency has replaced the tether stablecoin as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market value.

XRP prices fell from $0.55 to $0.20 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced a lawsuit against Ripple Labs on Dec. 22, triggering a number of exchange delistings of the cryptocurrency. The regulator charged the company with violating securities laws by raising $1.3 billion over seven years from retail investors through its sales of XRP.

Ripple Labs pushed back against the SEC’s allegations on Friday, arguing the functionality and liquidity of XRP are wholly incompatible with securities regulation, and its registration as a security would impair its main utility in faster, cheaper and more transparent global payments.

The cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid on Saturday, rising 56% to register its biggest single-day gain in three years, and has remained on the offensive ever since.

A coordinated effort by the members of the two-day-old Telegram group called “Buy & Hold XRP” alongside calls to buy XRP by the r/SatoshiStreetBets group seems to have helped push the cryptocurrency to multi-month highs. At press time, the Telegram pump group had 200,000 members.

However, some observers are of the opinion the Telegram traders may not be the sole drivers of the price rise. “24H volume on XRP on Sunday was over $26 billion. Even if each of the groups’ members dropped $5,000 on XRP, that equates to 2% of total daily volume. Let’s be rational here – no Telegram group is pumping the 5th largest coin in the space,” popular Twitter-based analyst Credible Crypto tweeted Sunday.

The cryptocurrency is trading near $0.66 at press time, representing a nearly 30% gain on the day.

“XRP’s next target is $0.80, which, if breached, would allow a rally to $1 and higher,” Alex Melikhov, CEO and founder of cryptocurrency framework Equilibrium and the EOSDT stablecoin, told CoinDesk.

“Traditional Crypto-Pump groups are being copied and legitimized by WallStreetBets-style crowd-pumps, and are now turning their burning gaze from dogecoin to XRP,” Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Hong Kong-based Kenetic Capital, told CoinDesk.

Classic pump and dump tactics are not new to crypto, particularly for XRP, which has a strong army of followers. However, their morale may have been boosted by a group of amateur day traders based on a Reddit forum called WallStreetBets, who recently launched a coordinated buying attack on the video game retailer GameStop (GME), triggering a short squeeze and inflicting heavy losses for hedge funds.

GameStop surged nearly 400% last week, extending the preceding week’s 83% rise and attracting unwanted attention from regulators. Meanwhile, the meme-based cryptocurrency dogecoin surged 800% a day before XRP’s price pump.

The top cryptocurrency hit a peak price of $41,962 on Jan. 8 and has mostly traded the range of $29,000–$40,000 since then, according to CoinDesk 20 data.

However, demand continues to outstrip supply amid the price lull. “In 2021 so far, around 26,000 BTC have been mined. Meanwhile, the Grayscale Investment Trust has acquired over 40,000 BTC in the same period,” Glassnode said in its weekly report.

Further, the number of coins held on exchange addresses continues to slide, taking sell-side liquidity off the market.

The balance of bitcoin held across all exchanges fell to a 2.5-year low of 2,349,040 on Monday, according to Glassnode.

Meanwhile, the number of whale entities – clusters of crypto wallet addresses held by a single network participant holding at least 1,000 BTC – jumped to a new record high of 2,218 on Sunday. The count has increased by over 50 during the recent bout of price consolidation in a sign of continued accumulation by investors large enough to influence market trends.

Lastly, the odds of a deeper drop due to profit-taking appear low, as the 24-hour average of bitcoin’s adjusted spent output ratio (aSOPR), recently fell to 1.00, indicating that coins moving between investors are no longer carrying profit. The SOPR metric measures the profit ratio of coins based on the prices when they last moved. The aSOPR ignores all outputs with a lifespan of less than one hour.

Bitcoin's aSOPR Source: Glassnode

Investors typically sell at a loss during bear markets, but bitcoin is currently in a bull market, having rallied by 200% in the past three months.

“For SOPR to go lower, investors would have to be willing to sell at a loss, which is unlikely given the current shape of the market. We have been looking for this reset to generate some stability in the market and pave the way for the next bull run,” Glassnode recently said. Historically, values below 1.0 have been consistently rejected during bull markets.

So, the odds appear stacked in favor of a convincing bitcoin move above $40,000. “The breakout may happen in two weeks; everything is bullish now,” trader and analyst Alex Kruger told CoinDesk over Twitter.

Kruger, however, cited potential dollar strength as a short-term risk to bitcoin’s bullish outlook. The Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback’s value against major currencies, is looking north, with the daily chart reporting an inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) breakout – a major bullish pattern (below right).

“If a bullish trend develops from DXY’s latest breakout, it could be a problem for bitcoin,” Kruger said. The breakout has opened the doors for a rise to 93.00. The DXY is trading near 91.12 at press time, little changed on the day.

Matthew Dibb, COO and co-founder of Stack Funds, voiced similar concerns while drawing attention to the fact that bitcoin’s rally from early November lows near $14,000 happened alongside the DXY’s decline from 94.5 to 89.00.

Bitcoin has moved mainly in the opposite direction to the U.S. dollar since the March markets crash, with the cryptocurrency witnessing consolidation or pullbacks during bouts of strength in USD. Bitcoin’s recent decline from record highs and the subsequent consolidation has been accompanied by a recovery rally in the dollar.

The inverse correlation between the two is likely the result of the dollar’s negative correlation to the appetite for risk in the global financial markets.

“Whenever risk sentiment deteriorates around the globe there is a natural desire to move to safety in the form of the U.S. dollar. And by extension, bitcoin, which is still an emerging asset, is exposed to risk-off,” Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital, told CoinDesk.

However, the dollar’s overall trend looks bearish, courtesy of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s open-ended money printing strategy, and analysts remain confident about bitcoin’s long-term prospects.

“Both for the medium and long term, bitcoin remains attractive and, ultimately, on that longer-term proposition, bitcoin should become an in-demand currency during periods of risk-off,” Kruger said.","['source', 'fundamentals', 'rally', 'ahead', 'market', 'price', 'kruger', 'point', 'dollar', 'bitcoin', 'breakout', 'risk', 'bullish', 'renewed', 'bitcoins']","Bitcoin exchange balance Source: GlassnodeThe balance of bitcoin held across all exchanges fell to a 2.5-year low of 2,349,040 on Monday, according to Glassnode.

Some exhaustion recently in the bitcoin market may have been caused by speculative activity in the stock market.

“More than anything else, we should all take the long-term sustained price levels above the 2017 high of $20,000 now over a month as the best possible endorsement of bitcoin being a long-term bullish asset,” added Tritum’s Willock.

Bitcoin’s gyrations seem to have subsided somewhat, helped by a very flat weekend into Monday. As of Feb. 1, bitcoin’s 30-day volatility has trended downward; but it is still above 100%, which is quite high. The S&P 500, by comparison, has a 30-day volatility below 20%.

As CoinDesk reported Tuesday, some analysts see several on-chain metrics for bitcoin’s price pointing in a bullish direction in the coming weeks. For example, a decreased amount of bitcoin held on exchange addresses indicates less pressure on the sell side.

In crypto trading, traders and investors often use stablecoins to put money into riskier cryptocurrencies; in such cases, buying stablecoins backed by government-issued currencies is seen as the first step necessary before buying other cryptocurrencies.

“The growth in on-exchange USDC reflects the increasing view among traders that USDC is a preferred base currency, as well as the fact that a lot of the new flows into crypto are starting with on-exchange activity,” Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of peer-to-peer payments company Circle, told CoinDesk through a spokesperson. He noted that USDC issuance in January saw “record levels.” Circle and crypto exchange Coinbase are behind USDC’s governing Centre consortium.

The circulating supply of USDC, which is valued 1:1 with the U.S. dollar, has grown to over 5 billion from just below 4 billion in the beginning of the month, sharp growth after slowing in October, according to data from Glassnode.

Increased exchange activity is also reflected in the significant price rise of exchanges’ utility tokens. Centralized exchanges Binance and FTX and decentralized exchanges Uniswap and SushiSwap all saw their exchange tokens hit new all-time highs in the past week.

The latest leg higher from $1,200 came alongside turmoil in the stock markets, where brokerage platforms like Robinhood have restricted transactions to rein volatility fueled by Reddit-based retail traders’ coordinated buying in stocks such as GameStop. The retail frenzy prompted by Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets forced hedge funds to unwind short bets in GameStop, leading to a 1,700% price rally in the 17 days to Jan. 28.

Crypto analysts believe the restrictive actions could bring more users into the DeFi space, which is dominated by Ethereum’s blockchain.

“With investment and trading platform Robinhood halting trading of certain assets like GameStop and Nokia (NOK), and Nasdaq President and CEO Adena Friedman calling for regulations to prevent retail investors from coordinating on social media, the case for cryptocurrencies only grows stronger,” Nicholas Pelecanos, head of trading at NEM Group, told CoinDesk.

According to Messari’s Ryan Selkis, the door for mass adoption of bitcoin, ethereum, DeFi and Web 3.0 assets has been flung open. “Buy ethereum to secure the fledging decentralized financial system and potentially make a lot of money, but also to tell your bank to f**k off,” Selkis noted in Thursday’s daily market brief.

Ether also has a store-of-value appeal, and a growing number of institutions have taken positions in the cryptocurrency, according to Coinbase’s recently released 2020 annual review.

While ether breaking a new lifetime high, bitcoin is down by near $7,000 from its record price of $41,962 reached on Jan. 8.

Job losses at IBM (NYSE: IBM) escalated as the company failed to meet its revenue targets for the once-fêted technology by 90% this year, according to one of the sources.

“IBM is doing a major reorganization,” said a source at a startup that has been interviewing former IBM blockchain staffers. “There is not really going to be a blockchain team any longer. Most of the blockchain people at IBM have left.”

IBM’s blockchain unit missed its revenue targets by a wide margin for two years in a row, said a second source. Expectations for enterprise blockchain were too high, they said, adding that IBM “didn’t really manage to execute, despite doing a lot of announcements.”

A spokesperson for IBM denied the claims.

“Our blockchain business is doing well, thank you,” Holli Haswell, a director of public relations at IBM, said via email. “We have realigned some leaders and business units to continue to drive growth – we do that every year.”

A former IBM staffer who had been working on enterprise blockchain, however, said there have been a succession of “Resource Actions,” or RAs, which basically means firing people based on business performance as opposed to personal performance.

“I would wager less than 10% [of the blockchain product and engineering team] is still working on IBM Blockchain,” said the ex-IBM source. “There have been tons of reorgs. Pretty much everyone is gone. IBM is now 100% focused on hybrid cloud, so everything that doesn’t support that is deprioritized.”

IBM has pumped a lot of money into blockchain since 2016, when it began talking about the technology’s potential to transform the way industries do business.

If IBM’s blockchain innovation work is now confined to some R&D, and does not even extend to consulting, as one of the sources said, this sounds an ominous note for the enterprise blockchain space in general – perhaps particularly for the Hyperledger collection of blockchains, to which IBM was a key contributor.

In its recent full-year results statement, IBM as a whole reported revenue fell 6% on an annualized basis. Looking back to its 2017 financial statement, IBM called itself the “blockchain leader for business.” All mention of the technology is now absent from the company’s statements.

No more TV commercials

In the past several years, IBM has pushed ahead with a series of blockchain networks built on Hyperledger Fabric. Big Blue’s major blockchain networks are FoodTrust, a farm-to-supermarket tracking system backed by Walmart; and TradeLens, a shipping container logistics blockchain backed by Maersk. IBM has also added the Trust Your Supplier network and previously had a go at payments via World Wire.

While cryptocurrencies and public blockchain networks appear to have flourished in 2020, the economic shock of COVID-19 has impacted innovation departments inside large firms, to the extent that areas not immediately generating revenue – such as blockchain – have been trimmed.

Another source, an enterprise blockchain engineer with former ties to IBM, estimated more than 100 blockchain-related jobs were cut at Big Blue over the last year.

The source also pointed out that Jerry Cuomo, IBM’s head of blockchain and an evangelist for the tech going back to 2016, has been moved and is now working on artificial intelligence.

“Jerry is indeed overseeing additional strategic, high-growth parts of the IBM business but is still involved in blockchain,” said Haswell, the company spokesperson. “He is a very senior technical leader and that is what we do in IBM – people’s roles expand.”

After publication of this article, Haswell further disputed the reporting, adding:

""IBM maintains a strong team dedicated to blockchain across the company. We have shifted some resources but remain committed to the technology, blockchain ecosystem and services. We see blockchain as a driver for our cloud business.""

On Jan. 7 the total cryptocurrency market hit an all-time high exceeding $1 trillion for the first time. Renewed interest in, and conversations around, blockchain technology and digital currencies from industry and government leaders have accompanied the rise.

At the same time, the challenges of 2020 continue, including the global pandemic. COVID-19 dominated the recent Davos agenda, with the need for digital solutions and real-time multi-party access to consistent information highlighted across multiple sectors.

At the World Economic Forum, we will continue to work with hundreds of experts from governments, business, civil society and academia to bring together the seemingly disparate worlds of crypto and long-standing institutions.

Sheila Warren is the Head of Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology at the World Economic Forum.

Here are some of the top trends we are watching this year:

Identity

All eyes are on digital identity for COVID-related needs – but long-term strategies and implications remain to be seen.

The COVID-19 crisis has increased consumer demand for identity solutions that don’t compromise individual privacy and freedoms. Of course, ideas of what constitutes the ideal level of privacy preservation vary widely around the world, with China and the U.S. taking deeply divergent perspectives. As the travel industry and various governments continue to explore ideas like “immunity passports,” which would maintain vaccination and/or testing records, the creation of a global standard around digital credentialing seems both necessary and elusive.

In addition, what does it mean to anchor on digital identity as a reaction to a very specific set of circumstances (namely an unprecedented global pandemic)? Digital identity systems are relevant for everything from financial services to re-skilling workforces, which each have distinct requirements. Focusing on one sector without taking a longer-term view can mean that we lose out on opportunities, duplicate efforts and create more complicated user experiences.

As it stands, there are very few regulations or industry standards to prevent fragmentation of technical solutions, protect privacy or promote inclusivity, interoperability and portability – all essential principles – for digital credentialing beyond time-sensitive use cases. As global society struggles to return to “normal,” there is a need to ensure potential solutions that embrace the use of digital credentials, leverage the experience of the digital identity community, consider a longer-term and holistic view, and create strong partnerships with public authorities.

Institutional adoption

Last year was the year of “institutional investment” in bitcoin – a buzzy phrase that was seen across pundit analyses of the crypto rallies, referring to large-scale investments of players such as MassMutual and Square (SQ). It is likely that financial institutions and service providers will intensify their own experiments with, and use of, cryptocurrency this year, whether via investment or actual deployment.

In some instances, they are also being used for improving internal processes. For example, in a Davos agenda panel Hikmet Ersek, CEO of Western Union, cited the company’s use of a stable “WU Coin” to exchange different currencies, done “21 times every second.”

COVID-19 also raised the profile of the conversation around central bank digital currencies’ exploration of blockchain technology. We saw the launch of some of the first national-level blockchain-based systems, including in the Bahamas and Cambodia. At the same time, progress around China’s DCEP (Digital Currency/Electronic Payment) continued in the background, with the People’s Bank of China having completed pilots in Shenzhen, Xiong’an and Suzhou, processing RMB 1.1 billion across 3.1 million transactions.

Still, many governments and central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, continue to research whether central bank digital currencies (CBDC) hold potential but have maintained they do not see value in issuing one at this time. Many are also watching the growth in the stablecoin space – with total value now surpassing $25 billion – fueled by decentralized finance (DeFi) and institutional interest. This has corresponded with increased attention from regulators, for instance the controversial STABLE Act in the U.S. and the recent letter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. We can expect continued regulatory interest and activity in this area from around the world.

NFTs boost inclusive wealth

We have come a long way since CryptoKitties, yet relatively little progress has been made in realizing the potential of non-fungible tokens (a cryptocurrency token that is indivisible and unique) outside of the gaming context.

But we are already seeing shifts around the dialogue of inclusion. Previously, there was talk of democratizing access to high-value assets, such as art. While there still might be potential here, it’s important to consider the implications for creators as well. For instance, some have spotlighted black artists and the role that crypto art can play in allowing for greater ownership and wealth creation within the space, as well as art exchanges. We’ve also seen early signs of how this may translate to music or writing.

Decentralized infrastructure

Awareness of the power that centralized platforms and service providers wield over our lives is moving beyond the crypto and blockchain community to the mainstream. Take, for example, the recent mass exodus from WhatsApp to Signal following a (relatively minor) change in Facebook’s data-sharing policies.

This may create an increase in demand for decentralized service provision. In 2020, we saw the highly anticipated launch of Filecoin from Protocol Labs and continued growth of Web 3.0 projects such as Keep, Oasis and Polkadot. The public cloud market is among the most highly concentrated in existence, with four providers controlling 80% of the market. Decentralized cloud storage is currently the only alternative that could pose a challenge to this status quo. Along with advances in AI, this transition could lead to significant expansion of the scope of human and machine interaction, and an acceleration of the transition to Web 3.0.

Even as we have been wrestling with the consequences of the greatest social and economic disruption of our lifetimes, the pace of work across the blockchain ecosystem has been accelerating. The great news is that awareness of the potential of decentralized systems now lives beyond the minds of a tiny minority and is slowly gaining awareness among a larger audience (although the bitcoin price index remains the biggest reason most people pay any attention to the space).","['watching', 'continue', 'solutions', 'currencies', 'crypto', 'decentralized', 'trends', 'warren', 'potential', 'sheila', 'global', 'digital', 'identity', 'im', 'blockchain']","Renewed interest in, and conversations around, blockchain technology and digital currencies from industry and government leaders have accompanied the rise.

The vote went live on the web app Snapshot on Jan. 28 and ended today at 18:00 UTC (1 p.m. ET).

Yearn Finance is a collectively designed robo-advisor for yield that is fast becoming a portal into all of DeFi. It’s governed by the token YFI, which is worth slightly more than $30,000, as of this writing.

There’s a total of 30,000 YFI in existence, per the project’s original “fair launch.” If the new tokens were minted right now and had no impact on the market capitalization, then one would expect the value of YFI to drop to something like $25,000 (meaning the new tokens would be worth $167 million), but these things are not predictable.

The final vote to increase the supply was 1,670 YFI for versus 331 against.

To participate in a vote, YFI holders have to stake to the governance contract in advance of a vote by a specified Ethereum block number. The total amount of YFI staked to vote on YIP-57 was 4,089.

Final changes are approved by six of the nine members of the Yearn multisig, which is something like the DeFi equivalent of a board of directors.

Under the proposal, 33% of the new tokens would be set aside for key contributors. Which contributors the allocation would be for and how much each would get is unknown. There will be some sort of staking set up so contributors only get their allocations for sticking around, but none of that has been decided.

The other 66% will be set aside as a treasury, for everything from protocol acquisition to further development.

The decision marks a clear shift for the team, which accrued a unique amount of buzz for eschewing the convention of setting aside governance tokens for insiders.

The authors of the newly passed proposal wrote:

""Yearn's launch was exceptional at creating a decentralized and engaged community, but it did not provide adequate incentives to retain existing and future contributors on an ongoing basis, nor did it provide the protocol with a war chest to fund future activities.""

The community remains somewhat divided on the initiative. As the vote indicates, though, most YFI holders are for it.

On the supporter side, user zkwaffles wrote:

""This seems to be the equivalent of an equity raising round. In these rounds an early-stage venture will issue equity and in effect dilute current shareholders. ... The overarching idea being that the cash raised will increase future value enough to offset any dilution.""

On the opposition, user laur_science argued the proposal wasn’t specific enough:

""I don't like it, so I voted against. It doesn't even specify what type of vesting we're talking about. I want it to be for 5 years, equal amounts per year.""","['set', 'community', 'tokens', 'proposal', 'token', 'contributors', 'defi', 'inflate', 'yearn', '20', 'future', 'vote', 'finance', 'supply', 'yfi', 'votes']","The Yearn Finance community has been discussing expanding the supply of YFI as a way to compensate the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform’s de facto staffers.

Balancer, a non-custodial portfolio manager, is releasing version 2.0, which puts all the assets entrusted to it in one big vault. This should dramatically reduce gas fees for decentralized finance (DeFi) trades because users can swap as much as they want, only paying gas for going into and out of Balancer.

The team had considered building it this way from the start but decided initially to be conservative and separate out each pool for added security, CEO Fernando Martinelli told CoinDesk.

“We are today … comfortable enough with having a big vault that holds a lot of money. We put a lot of effort into making this as safe as if the assets were siloed,” he wrote in an email. “Many other protocols (not AMMs) already do this: lending protocols, collateral in MakerDAO, etc.”

Balancer works much like (and can serve the function of) an automated market maker (AMM) like Uniswap or Curve but it allows users to create pools of multiple tokens, weighted as they see fit. The pools automatically rebalance as needed in order to stay in line with the market.

This requires making a lot of transactions, which in turn require a lot of Ethereum gas fees. That is not capital-efficient for traders nor for liquidity pool providers, especially as gas prices tick upward.

In this new version, the accounting for those pools will just be done in smart contracts separate from the big custody pool.

One big pool

With Balancer v2, no matter how complex a trade or trades, “only the final net token amounts are transferred from and to the vault, saving a significant amount of gas in the process,” Martinelli wrote in an announcement post. Balancer can keep track of all of the assets entrusted to it in one vault and just move allocations around on people’s accounts.

“Now, token management and accounting is done by the vault while the AMM logic is individual to each pool. Because pools are contracts external to the vault, they can implement any arbitrary, customized AMM logic,” the team wrote.

In fact, the new version will even take it a step further. Active traders can set up an individual account so they can make lots of trades. Then they will only be charged gas fees when they want to withdraw.

Of course, that may sound more like a centralized exchange to some traders, which is somewhat fair. The key difference here is it’s all being kept on smart contracts that can be reviewed by the public; and, as an Ethereum project, its functionality can be easily integrated into others.

It does raise a security concern. To oversimplify it, think of it this way: If someone had a large treasure of gold, it would be trickier to steal it all if it were locked away in multiple vaults in different places rather than one big vault.

Martinelli does not dispute this, but he also notes that the more-complex logic in Balancer doesn’t touch the assets, which should be reassuring.

“Since the operations the vault will be doing are very low-level (add to a user balance, remove from a pool the user traded with), we will make everything (including formal verification) to make sure the vault is safe and sound,” Martinelli said via email.

Other developments

Balancer is adding some other features in version 2.0 that may be of interest to more advanced users. Crucially, it wants to make it easier to experiment with composition pools.

“Balancer v2 pioneers customizable AMM logic: [I]t effectively creates a launch pad for teams to innovate with different AMM strategies without having to worry about low level token transfers, balance accounting, security checks [and] smart order routing,” the announcement says.

It will go live with the familiar weighted pools that Balancer users know already. It will also have stable pools that work more as Curve does, so big trades on stablecoins can see very little slippage. Soon, Balancer will launch smart pools, whose logic can change on the fly.

Balancer will also introduce asset managers, external smart contracts that can be used to put some of a liquidity pools’ underlying value to work elsewhere in DeFi. This should be good for liquidity providers, because as the team notes, “in normal trading conditions, most of the assets in an AMM are not actually used.”

Balancer will also introduce trading fees that can be controlled by holders of its BAL token. It will offer fees on trades, withdrawals and flash loans. Only the final fee will be active at the start of version 2.0, however. BAL holders can use the fees either to pay for further development, for a dividend or some combination of both.

Balancer was one of the earliest projects to join the liquidity mining craze this summer, launching BAL distributions to users shortly after COMP distributions went live. Like on Compound, BAL liquidity mining has never stopped.

“We are currently discussing with the community some interesting updates to BAL liquidity mining. It will certainly continue though: it’s our main way to make sure we have a diverse and engaged governance,” Martinelli noted.","['gas', 'pool', 'amm', 'fees', 'balancers', 'liquidity', 'version', 'balancer', 'cuts', 'vault', 'transactions', 'big', 'users', 'pools']","Balancer, a non-custodial portfolio manager, is releasing version 2.0, which puts all the assets entrusted to it in one big vault.

In light of Robinhood’s disabling of buying in a number of stocks, there is a lot of fury about potential conflicts of interest that are not new but now suddenly in the spotlight.

The situation emphasizes the need for transparency in markets and why certain marketing that appears beneficial – “Trade stocks for free!” – may have deleterious characteristics under some circumstances.

Matthew Trudeau, chief Operating Officer at ErisX, has participated in the successful launch of 12 electronic trading venues. Prior to ErisX, Matthew was most recently co-founder and president of Tradewind Markets, an electronic trading platform and blockchain-based post trade system for physical precious metals.

In a practice known as “payment for order flow,” or PFOF, brokers sell their clients’ order flow to professional trading firms called “internalizers.” This practice has been covered by the media many times over the years, more recently by Institutional Investor and MSN. Brokers send individual investors’ orders, e.g., to buy stock in GameStop, to the internalizers that pay to trade against this “dumb flow.” The internalizers then net-offset the retail trades, keeping the spread, or offset trades on the national stock exchanges, presumably at a profit that exceeds the cost of their payments made to Robinhood and other retail brokers. The majority of retail equities orders never execute on an actual stock exchange.

So, retail traders trade for “free” and the brokers and professional internalizers still make lots of money. Not all market makers support PFOF. The question retail traders should be asking is, how much in hidden fees are they paying? If the non-transparent markups, spreads, or opportunity costs are greater than an explicit and transparent trade commission, then “free” may be pretty misleading. How fees and conflicts are disclosed and managed, or not, is pretty important. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seems to agree.

Well, good thing this only happens in equity trading. Crypto must be free of these conflicts, right?

Not exactly.

There is a lot of lip service paid to “democratizing access.” Call us fundamentalists, but when we envision a “democratized market” we envision an exchange where all members can trade with all other members according to a common set of rules and standards.

If the non-transparent markups, spreads or opportunity costs are greater than an explicit and transparent trade commission, then 'free' may be pretty misleading.

It’s a market where price discovery and liquidity are available to all on equal terms, and where the commingling of order flows from many different participants with diverse market outlooks and time horizons produce a better market quality. A central limit order book (CLOB), the model most typically found on regulated futures and stock exchanges such as the CME and Nasdaq, provides such a market structure (as we discussed here and here). On a CLOB, with a published price schedule and displayed quotations, the full cost of a trade is explicit and transparent: the price at which investors can purchase or sell a quantity of an asset plus the transaction fee. It is really pretty simple.

It does not strike us as very “democratic” when order flow gets channeled to exclusive liquidity providers that gain an informational advantage as a result of that exclusivity, particularly where that conflict is not well disclosed. Almost without fail, if a trading or pricing arrangement is not fully transparent there is, at worst, a problem or conflict. Or, as may be the case with unregulated/offshore markets, something untoward may be happening. At best there is an arrangement the parties would rather keep quiet from their products, er, customers.

As a new asset, crypto has had the opportunity to learn from the market structure examples of traditional markets. Unfortunately, some of the lessons that have ported over are sub-optimal arrangements rather than best practices.

An apparently significant part of the crypto market structure involves brokers sending client orders to over-the-counter “trading venues,” in that model a synonym for internalizing dealers. Or, in some cases, the broker is the dealer. (It is worth noting that in traditional markets there are strict rules that generally prohibit or restrict exchanges and brokers trading against their own clients.) OTC liquidity provision is a variation on the PFOF model. Instead of all-to-all trading with the explicit and transparent fees CLOBs enable, the OTC liquidity model replicates the implicit costs, informational advantages, opacity and potential conflicts of interest that have been problematic in equities and FX trading.

The Robinhood saga also exposes another risk of the exclusive liquidity provider model: counterparty risk. There has been a lot of speculation about why Robinhood disabled the buying of certain stocks. We will not wade into that discussion, but it does beg the question of what happens when the liquidity providers cannot or will not provide the liquidity, or cannot or will not settle trades. A CLOB diversifies counterparties and a clearinghouse eliminates settlement risk. These are proven market infrastructures that were designed in response to past market failures and disruptions.","['retail', 'transparent', 'order', 'trudeau', 'matthew', 'market', 'markets', 'crypto', 'alltoall', 'liquidity', 'brokers', 'arent', 'trading', 'trade', 'model']","Matthew Trudeau, chief Operating Officer at ErisX, has participated in the successful launch of 12 electronic trading venues.

[],2021-02-02 15:00:00+00:00,https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Manta-Network-1200x628.jpg,"A new survey by Manta Network, a privacy-preserving decentralized finance stack built on Substrate, has shed further light on the need for privacy in the rapidly expanding DeFi space.

“We think one of the biggest problems that need to be tackled exists on decentralized exchanges,” said Shumo Chu, CEO and co-founder of Manta Network, in an email.

“The volume is large and increasing on decentralized exchanges, but DEXs are also a hotbed for front-running opportunities due to the transparent nature of the blockchain. Someone can see your transaction before it gets written and confirmed, and make the same transaction with a higher fee to get priority and pass that transaction before you do.”

Privacy in DeFi

According to the survey, nearly three-quarters of the 404 respondents (73.2%) “have either hesitated or completely avoided making a transaction in the past because they were worried about the privacy implications of that transaction.”

Additionally, 84% of respondents expressed concern about their wallet addresses being linked to their real identity. Part of this concern was caused due to the fact that the nature of blockchains allows people to see address balances.

In fact, over 90% of survey respondents said they’d looked up someone’s wallet address to view that person’s holdings and/or transactions.

The survey adds further weight to the notion that privacy is a central concern in the cryptocurrency space, and the Manta Network is one of a number of different projects in the DeFi space working to increase privacy functionality.

The Manta Network

The Manta Network aims to bolster privacy in DeFi, in part, by obfuscating wallet addresses, but with the overall aim of letting users transact and exchange privacy. A parachain in the Polkadot ecosystem, Manta Network’s first major project is a privacy-preserving automated market maker (AMM) DEX called MantaSwap.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

The Manta Network is working to implement ZkSNARKs on the blockchain level. ZkSNARKs are a cryptographic technique that allows two entities to verify information with each other without having to share the underlying data related to it.

Think about it in the context of logging into a website, for example. The site verifies who you are without sharing your password, geolocation data or other information that can be used to figure out additional details about yourself that you aren’t aware you might be giving up.

According to Chu, Manta’s use of ZkSNARKS can bring privacy to transactions and user identity.

“While you are still able to monitor your own transactions, no one else can do so anymore,” he said. “By taking this and applying it in an interoperable manner (through Polkadot), we’re able to provide a plug-and-play solution for the entire ecosystem in the future.”

Right now though, Chu said the team is focusing on enhancing usability, given their goal is to be a plug-and-play solution. Additionally, they’re working to ensure transparency of both the code itself as well as the process.

“As part of the usability, we also want to focus on the security of the implementation, which takes time,” he said.

Why privacy matters

The implications for transparent transactions aren’t limited to someone knowing how much money is in an address. It can have tangible downstream effects, given that information is power.

In traditional finance, if you want to view your bank account information (including transactions and total cash), you have to prove that you are the owner of that account. No one else is allowed to view your information without your consent.

“It’s different on the blockchain – anyone who knows your wallet address can review your transactions, trace your transactions and see all of your assets,” said Chu.

Chu said that lack of privacy leads to a host of other issues that arise in scaling out blockchain use cases. Automated monitoring and scraping leads to unauthorized data collection, opening up potential opportunities for blackmail. In corporate use cases, trade secrets may be revealed by tracing transactions on chain.

On decentralized exchanges, that transparency leads to front-running opportunities, according to Chu. People are taking extra steps, which increases the friction of usage, just to make transactions more obfuscated.

Chu said the availability of privacy products are a secondary issue on DEXs, which is part of the reason he said he wants Manta Network to be plug and play.

“Future DEX projects don’t need to bring onboard their own cryptography team; they can use our development tools,” he said. “Other DeFi projects and general blockchain projects can do the same thing.”

Funding and the future

The Manta Network, which was previously a Web 3.0 Foundation Grant winner, closed a $1.1 million funding round, led by Polychain Capital, to build MantaSwap.

“Manta Network brings an experienced team to tackle the critical and growing issues regarding privacy on the blockchain,” said Ben Perszyk, partner at Polychain, in a statement. “Its unique approach to building as a Polkadot parachain enables them to offer plug-and-play privacy to a multitude of use cases and projects, starting with their own privacy-preserving DEX.”

The funding will jump-start Manta Network’s development. The team is currently finishing its prototype to deliver to the Web3 Foundation. Before the end of Q1, it will be delivering the first version of its test net. In future releases of the test net, it will introduce other assets as well as exchange functionality.","['information', 'privacy', 'manta', 'wallet', 'projects', 'boost', 'network', 'getting', 'transaction', 'team', 'transactions', 'blockchain', 'defi']","A new survey by Manta Network, a privacy-preserving decentralized finance stack built on Substrate, has shed further light on the need for privacy in the rapidly expanding DeFi space.

All of this adds up to significant upfront costs.

Mining is the “glue” that holds together many cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, by ensuring that the network comes to consensus on each and every change made in the system. Ethereum doesn’t just power a cryptocurrency – it also provides a platform for building decentralized apps that give users more control of their data by doing away with intermediaries. Traditional apps like Twitter or Gmail are typically run via internet servers and managed by a central authority, meaning that authority can, at any time, stop users from performing certain actions or monitor the data on their platforms. Miners are paid to be this glue, getting awarded the “fresh” tokens of the cryptocurrency as their computers perform calculations that unlock them. That’s why most people take up the venture in the first place.

Miners set computers loose to grind through cryptographic computations in an attempt to win ether, Ethereum’s native token. They need to try a huge number of computational problems until one unlocks a new batch of the asset.

In theory, anyone can set their computers to focus on these cryptographic puzzles as a way to win rewards. The catch is that mining on major public blockchains tends to require more and more power over time. As more people invest in more powerful hardware to mine cryptocurrency, the calculations get harder. Miners using regular computers are very, very unlikely to win.

Choosing mining hardware

Before getting started, you will need special computer hardware to dedicate full-time to mining.

There are three types of mining hardware:

CPUs

GPUs: Faster than CPUs

ASICs: Even faster and more powerful than GPUs

GPUs and ASICs boast a higher hashrate, meaning they can guess puzzle answers more quickly. At time of writing, GPUs and ASICs are now the only cost-effective option for ether miners. CPUs aren’t powerful enough anymore.

Settling up a GPU is a complex task and you can browse plenty of advice about which ones are the most profitable based on how many hashes the GPU can compute per second, power consumption and the initial expense of the card.

You probably want to set up a mining rig, a machine that might be composed of multiple GPUs and can take a week to build.Online mining profitability calculators, such as the one offered by Etherscan, give some insight into the likely amount of ether you’ll earn at a given hashrate, and whether that ether is enough – when cutting out the costs of setup and electricity – to make a profit.

Installing Ethereum software

After selecting some mining hardware, the next step is to install the mining software.

Miners need to install an Ethereum client to connect to the wider Ethereum network. An internet connection is vital for miners. Without an internet connection, the node won’t be able to do much of anything.

Programmers familiar with the command line can install Geth, software that runs an Ethereum node written in the scripting language Go, or any of the other Ethereum clients, like Parity or OpenEthereum.

Download Geth here, using the directions for your appropriate operating system (Windows, Mac OS, or Linux), unzip it, and run it.

Once installed, your node can then connect to the Ethereum network where it can then “talk” to other nodes, to catch wind of the latest transactions and blocks. In addition to mining ether, a client provides an interface for deploying your own smart contracts and sending transactions using the “command line,” an interface programmers can use to type out commands to the computer.

Install Ethereum mining software

Aspiring miners then need to install the official mining software, Ethminer.

Find the download for the appropriate version of Windows here, or GPU mining instructions for other operating systems here.

Once installed, your node will officially play a part in securing the Ethereum network. For more detailed instructions on any of the above, visit the official ethereum website.

Joining a mining pool

As a miner, you’re unlikely to be able to mine ether on your own.

That’s why miners “pool” together their computational power into “mining pools,” to improve their chances of solving the cryptographic puzzles and earning ether. Then, they split the profits proportional to how much power each miner contributed.

There are many factors involved in joining a mining pool. Each pool might not be around forever, and the computational power of each pool is constantly changing, so there are a number of factors that go into deciding which to join.

One point to keep in mind is that mining pools have different payout structures. And pools charge mining fees.

Today the most popular mining pools are:

Ethermine

F2Pool

Sparkpool

Nanopool

The distribution of Ethereum mining pools as of Jan. 7, 2021. (Etherscan.io)

Mining pools generally have a signup process on their website so miners can connect to the pool and begin mining.

Find cheap electricity

The other biggest mining cost is electricity. Many profitable miners scout for electricity discounts, either by moving to regions around the world with less expensive electricity or by tapping renewable energy sources.

Ethereum Mining FAQs

Is Ethereum mining profitable?

The answer is complex. There are many variables miners need to consider when taking the plunge into mining, such as how much ether is worth at a given time and cost of electricity, an expensive necessity for mining. The cost of electricity varies across the globe.

How could the Ethereum upgrade ‘ProgPoW’ impact mining?

ProgPoW is a proposed Ethereum upgrade that, if implemented, would hamstring the most powerful miners. The motive for doing so is to keep the network decentralized by trying to ensure that no one in the network gets too much power.

In short, miners using ASICs (hardware even more powerful for mining than GPUs – see above) are the ones that would be affected. Their ASICs, which miners likely paid a premium for, would no longer be able to be used to mine ether.

How will Ethereum 2.0 upgrade impact mining?

The upgrade Ethereum 2.0 started roll out on Dec. 1, 2020, and will be iterated upon over the next several years.

The upgrade will impact mining even more drastically than ProgPoW. Once Ethereum 2.0 is fully rolled out, the goal is to eradicate miners completely, paving the way for a more energy-efficient method of maintaining the integrity of the Ethereum blockchain.

How do I keep abreast of Ethereum events that could impact mining?

The mining world is a whirlwind of change. The tools that you pick up today might be obsolete next year. Some mining pools might fall away while others emerge.

As a miner it’s worth keeping aware of industry shifts by keeping tabs on the latest mining news as well as Ethereum protocol upgrades.","['ether', 'need', 'power', 'network', 'mining', 'upgrade', 'miners', 'ethereum', '101', 'pools', 'electricity']","Miners need to install an Ethereum client to connect to the wider Ethereum network.

['Chris Cronimund'],,https://static.coindesk.com/static/chunks/images/facebook-cd851abcf9cbd3f39aaafc2c0a54009d.png,"If you are interested in buying or selling a cryptocurrency, there are few better places to look than one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trade volume, Binance.

Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao – who earned the number-one spot on CoinDesk’s 2018 Most Influential list – Binance rose to prominence during the historic crypto market-wide bull run in 2017 by supporting a wide array of cryptocurrencies in what was, and perhaps still is, one of the fastest and most reliable trading platforms.

In fact, Binance became so popular, so quickly that CZ and Binance both became worth more than $1 billion in less than one year, officially making it one of the first companies to achieve “unicorn” status in the cryptocurrency industry.

Yet despite its reputation as a destination for crypto traders, it’s not exactly easy for users who lack a traditional trading or investment background to navigate their way around.

In this piece, we take a step-by-step look at how to use Binance and conduct a trade on the exchange.

Signing up

First thing’s first, you’ll need to create an account. Anyone is able to sign up since Binance does not require customer information, but by doing so “you acknowledge and declare that you are not on any trade or economic sanctions lists” as per its Terms of Use.

This includes citizens of the member countries in the UN Security Council Sanctions list, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC), among other groups.

The terms also state each user must be at least 18 years of age. Binance reserves the right to cancel or freeze any account If the terms are disobeyed.

If the restrictions do not apply to you, to sign up simply navigate to the homepage and click register.

You will then be asked to enter a minimal amount of personal information such as your email address, password, and a referral ID if you have one.

As per Binance’s referral system, you will receive 50 percent of your referrals trading fees.

After you fill in the required fields, click “Register” and complete the captcha, a confirmation link will be sent to your email address.

Once the link is clicked, your Binance account is ready to be used.

Deposit Funds

Now that your account is activated, but before exploring the rest of the exchange, you’ll need to add funds to your account if you wish to buy or sell any cryptocurrencies.

Pay with credit card

Binance has a feature that allows users to purchase certain cryptocurrencies directly with their Visa or Mastercard credit card. If you are a qualified candidate, navigate to the “Funds” tab and select “Buy With Credit Card.”

You will then be required to enter the purchase amount of the desired cryptocurrency and whether you will be paying with the US dollar or euro. Cryptocurrency purchases by credit card are limited to BTC, ETH, and LTC at this time.

There is a minimum processing fee of $10 or 3.5 percent of the total order – whichever is more expensive. After completing this step, you will need to confirm your billing information, email address as well as your identity.

A valid government issued form of ID is required to be submitted to confirm your identity.

Once all of the required steps have been completed, the newly purchased cryptocurrency should reach your Binance wallet within 10-30 minutes.

Deposit from wallet

You can also make a deposit by sending funds from a separate cryptocurrency wallet into your Binance account.

In order to do this, navigate to the “Funds” tab once again and click “Balances.”

On this page, you will see all of the cryptocurrencies available for trading on Binance. To deposit the corresponding crypto into any of these, simply click the “Deposit” button next to the crypto asset of your choice.

Next, either scan the QR code from your cryptocurrency wallet or paste in the address and then send.

Once that’s complete, wait for the transaction to process and you’ll be ready for trading.

Placing a trade

Let’s go back to the home page now that your funds are ready to be used.

Here, you will again see all the cryptocurrencies that are tradable on Binance and their respective markets.

For this example, let’s say you previously deposited 0.0024 BTC (~$10) into your account and now wish to trade it for NEO.

First, you’ll need to find the right NEO market.

Since you want to spend BTC in order to get NEO, click the “BTC Markets” tab and then type NEO into the search bar.

Click the appropriate row and the page where trading takes place will open.

Trading module

This page may look intimidating, but you can easily get the hang of it with a bit of practice.

Plus, most cryptocurrency exchanges have a similar trading interface so what you remember here, in all likelihood, will be relevant elsewhere.

The left section of the screen is known as an order book.

Here, you will see all active buy and sell limit orders. A limit order is simply an order that will only be placed at the user’s desired price, given there are buyers or sellers interested at that level.

If you would like to learn the “in’s and out’s” of an order book, check out our comprehensive guide, but for now all you need to know is that the top of the order book (red) is where the limit sell orders wait to be filled and the bottom section (green) is where the limit buy orders wait to be filled.

The right side of the page is more simple – the above section shows the other cryptocurrencies that can be traded and the lower section shows the public trade history of the market currently being viewed.

Trade example: Buying NEO

The center of the page is where the real magic happens.

Here lays a chart feature that shows real-time price action and technical analysis indicators. Just below the chart is where you will actually execute the trade, so let’s buy some NEO.

If certainty of execution is your priority, select market order. If you are interested in only buying at a specific price level, select either limit or stop-limit order.

For the purposes of this example, let’s place a market order, which will be placed immediately at current market prices.

Now, just enter the amount of BTC desired to be spent and how much NEO you want to purchase. Binance has a useful shortcut for entering the purchase amount and it is based on a percentage of your bitcoin balance (or any other appropriate trading pair).

Let’s spend 50 percent of the BTC balance so there is some left over, perhaps for another trade.

The last step is to click the big green button “Buy NEO.” Since this is a market order, the trade for 0.58 NEO should have completed instantly, but that is most likely not the case if you selected limit or stop-limit order.

To check on the status of your order, look towards the bottom of the page where it says “Open order.” As the title would suggest, if your order has not yet executed, in other words, is still “open,” it will appear in this box until it has either been canceled or filled.

When it has been filled, it will show up in the lower box highlighting your 24-hour order history, just as how this order has below.

In order to sell, simply follow this same process but execute a market or limit sell order.

Withdrawing funds

While Binance does have a decentralized exchange in the works, the existing platform is centralized and susceptible to hacks like many other websites, so it’s recommended funds are only held on the exchange for as long as necessary.

In order to withdraw, navigate back to the “Balances” page. If you would like to see only the cryptocurrencies you have a substantial balance in, check the “hide” box.

Now select the withdrawal button in the NEO row and have your destination address or QR code handy. Paste the address and select how much you want to withdraw.

Last but not least, click submit and wait for the transaction to complete.

Binance Launchpad

The Binance Launchpad is a token launch platform exclusive to Binance and plans to offer token sales for new projects.

Binance handpicks which tokens to launch based on a number of factors including project maturity, scalability and adoption readiness, team quality and the ability of the project to benefit the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

To ensure the sales are being conducted in compliance with regulatory regimes around the world, each user must verify his or her Binance account.

Completed token sales, as well as those scheduled for a future date, can be seen on the home page of the Binance Launchpad. It’s worth noting that the token sales operate on a “first come, first serve” basis and usually sell out in just minutes, so be sure to do your due diligence.

If you successfully participate in a Launchpad token sale, the tokens will be automatically credited to your Binance account.

Security

Like most modern cryptocurrency exchanges, two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled on Binance and is highly recommended to be set up in order to add an extra layer of protection to your account.

In order to do so, navigate to your account summary by clicking the user avatar in the top right of the home page.

Once directed to your account page, a prompt will likely appear suggesting you to enable 2FA, which happens to automatically pops up when a new user accesses this page.

Binance allows two methods for enabling 2FA, via SMS or Google Authenticator.

With the SMS version, simply enter your mobile phone number and the verification code sent to the corresponding phone and you will be all set.

If Google Authenticator is your 2FA of choice, download the mobile application, open it and scan the QR code provided by Binance. Next, you will be asked to write down a 16-word recovery phrase to be used as a backup in case you lose access to this google authentication.

Lastly, you will be prompted to enter your account’s login password and the authenticator code found in the Google Authenticator mobile app. Once complete, this form of 2FA security will be complete.

Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao – who earned the number-one spot on CoinDesk’s 2018 Most Influential list – Binance rose to prominence during the historic crypto market-wide bull run in 2017 by supporting a wide array of cryptocurrencies in what was, and perhaps still is, one of the fastest and most reliable trading platforms.

In fact, Binance became so popular, so quickly that CZ and Binance both became worth more than $1 billion in less than one year, officially making it one of the first companies to achieve “unicorn” status in the cryptocurrency industry.

Yet despite its reputation as a destination for crypto traders, it’s not exactly easy for users who lack a traditional trading or investment background to navigate their way around.

In this piece, we take a step-by-step look at how to use Binance and conduct a trade on the exchange.

Signing up

First thing’s first, you’ll need to create an account. Anyone is able to sign up since Binance does not require customer information, but by doing so “you acknowledge and declare that you are not on any trade or economic sanctions lists” as per its Terms of Use.

This includes citizens of the member countries in the UN Security Council Sanctions list, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC), among other groups.

The terms also state each user must be at least 18 years of age. Binance reserves the right to cancel or freeze any account If the terms are disobeyed.

If the restrictions do not apply to you, to sign up simply navigate to the homepage and click register.

You will then be asked to enter a minimal amount of personal information such as your email address, password, and a referral ID if you have one.

As per Binance’s referral system, you will receive 50 percent of your referrals trading fees.

After you fill in the required fields, click “Register” and complete the captcha, a confirmation link will be sent to your email address.

Once the link is clicked, your Binance account is ready to be used.

Deposit Funds

Now that your account is activated, but before exploring the rest of the exchange, you’ll need to add funds to your account if you wish to buy or sell any cryptocurrencies.

Pay with credit card

Binance has a feature that allows users to purchase certain cryptocurrencies directly with their Visa or Mastercard credit card. If you are a qualified candidate, navigate to the “Funds” tab and select “Buy With Credit Card.”

You will then be required to enter the purchase amount of the desired cryptocurrency and whether you will be paying with the US dollar or euro. Cryptocurrency purchases by credit card are limited to BTC, ETH, and LTC at this time.

There is a minimum processing fee of $10 or 3.5 percent of the total order – whichever is more expensive. After completing this step, you will need to confirm your billing information, email address as well as your identity.

A valid government issued form of ID is required to be submitted to confirm your identity.

Once all of the required steps have been completed, the newly purchased cryptocurrency should reach your Binance wallet within 10-30 minutes.

Deposit from wallet

You can also make a deposit by sending funds from a separate cryptocurrency wallet into your Binance account.

In order to do this, navigate to the “Funds” tab once again and click “Balances.”

On this page, you will see all of the cryptocurrencies available for trading on Binance. To deposit the corresponding crypto into any of these, simply click the “Deposit” button next to the crypto asset of your choice.

Next, either scan the QR code from your cryptocurrency wallet or paste in the address and then send.

Once that’s complete, wait for the transaction to process and you’ll be ready for trading.

Placing a trade

Let’s go back to the home page now that your funds are ready to be used.

Here, you will again see all the cryptocurrencies that are tradable on Binance and their respective markets.

For this example, let’s say you previously deposited 0.0024 BTC (~$10) into your account and now wish to trade it for NEO.

First, you’ll need to find the right NEO market.

Since you want to spend BTC in order to get NEO, click the “BTC Markets” tab and then type NEO into the search bar.

Click the appropriate row and the page where trading takes place will open.

Trading module

This page may look intimidating, but you can easily get the hang of it with a bit of practice.

Plus, most cryptocurrency exchanges have a similar trading interface so what you remember here, in all likelihood, will be relevant elsewhere.

The left section of the screen is known as an order book.

Here, you will see all active buy and sell limit orders. A limit order is simply an order that will only be placed at the user’s desired price, given there are buyers or sellers interested at that level.

If you would like to learn the “in’s and out’s” of an order book, check out our comprehensive guide, but for now all you need to know is that the top of the order book (red) is where the limit sell orders wait to be filled and the bottom section (green) is where the limit buy orders wait to be filled.

The right side of the page is more simple – the above section shows the other cryptocurrencies that can be traded and the lower section shows the public trade history of the market currently being viewed.

Trade example: Buying NEO

The center of the page is where the real magic happens.

Here lays a chart feature that shows real-time price action and technical analysis indicators. Just below the chart is where you will actually execute the trade, so let’s buy some NEO.

If certainty of execution is your priority, select market order. If you are interested in only buying at a specific price level, select either limit or stop-limit order.

For the purposes of this example, let’s place a market order, which will be placed immediately at current market prices.

Now, just enter the amount of BTC desired to be spent and how much NEO you want to purchase. Binance has a useful shortcut for entering the purchase amount and it is based on a percentage of your bitcoin balance (or any other appropriate trading pair).

Let’s spend 50 percent of the BTC balance so there is some left over, perhaps for another trade.

The last step is to click the big green button “Buy NEO.” Since this is a market order, the trade for 0.58 NEO should have completed instantly, but that is most likely not the case if you selected limit or stop-limit order.

To check on the status of your order, look towards the bottom of the page where it says “Open order.” As the title would suggest, if your order has not yet executed, in other words, is still “open,” it will appear in this box until it has either been canceled or filled.

When it has been filled, it will show up in the lower box highlighting your 24-hour order history, just as how this order has below.

In order to sell, simply follow this same process but execute a market or limit sell order.

Withdrawing funds

While Binance does have a decentralized exchange in the works, the existing platform is centralized and susceptible to hacks like many other websites, so it’s recommended funds are only held on the exchange for as long as necessary.

In order to withdraw, navigate back to the “Balances” page. If you would like to see only the cryptocurrencies you have a substantial balance in, check the “hide” box.

Now select the withdrawal button in the NEO row and have your destination address or QR code handy. Paste the address and select how much you want to withdraw.

Last but not least, click submit and wait for the transaction to complete.

Binance Launchpad

The Binance Launchpad is a token launch platform exclusive to Binance and plans to offer token sales for new projects.

Binance handpicks which tokens to launch based on a number of factors including project maturity, scalability and adoption readiness, team quality and the ability of the project to benefit the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

To ensure the sales are being conducted in compliance with regulatory regimes around the world, each user must verify his or her Binance account.

Completed token sales, as well as those scheduled for a future date, can be seen on the home page of the Binance Launchpad. It’s worth noting that the token sales operate on a “first come, first serve” basis and usually sell out in just minutes, so be sure to do your due diligence.

If you successfully participate in a Launchpad token sale, the tokens will be automatically credited to your Binance account.

Security

Like most modern cryptocurrency exchanges, two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled on Binance and is highly recommended to be set up in order to add an extra layer of protection to your account.

In order to do so, navigate to your account summary by clicking the user avatar in the top right of the home page.

Once directed to your account page, a prompt will likely appear suggesting you to enable 2FA, which happens to automatically pops up when a new user accesses this page.

Binance allows two methods for enabling 2FA, via SMS or Google Authenticator.

With the SMS version, simply enter your mobile phone number and the verification code sent to the corresponding phone and you will be all set.

If Google Authenticator is your 2FA of choice, download the mobile application, open it and scan the QR code provided by Binance. Next, you will be asked to write down a 16-word recovery phrase to be used as a backup in case you lose access to this google authentication.

While Binance does have a decentralized exchange in the works, the existing platform is centralized and susceptible to hacks like many other websites, so it’s recommended funds are only held on the exchange for as long as necessary.

In order to withdraw, navigate back to the “Balances” page. If you would like to see only the cryptocurrencies you have a substantial balance in, check the “hide” box.

Now select the withdrawal button in the NEO row and have your destination address or QR code handy. Paste the address and select how much you want to withdraw.

Last but not least, click submit and wait for the transaction to complete.

Binance Launchpad

The Binance Launchpad is a token launch platform exclusive to Binance and plans to offer token sales for new projects.

Binance handpicks which tokens to launch based on a number of factors including project maturity, scalability and adoption readiness, team quality and the ability of the project to benefit the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

To ensure the sales are being conducted in compliance with regulatory regimes around the world, each user must verify his or her Binance account.

Completed token sales, as well as those scheduled for a future date, can be seen on the home page of the Binance Launchpad. It’s worth noting that the token sales operate on a “first come, first serve” basis and usually sell out in just minutes, so be sure to do your due diligence.

If you successfully participate in a Launchpad token sale, the tokens will be automatically credited to your Binance account.

Security

Like most modern cryptocurrency exchanges, two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled on Binance and is highly recommended to be set up in order to add an extra layer of protection to your account.

In order to do so, navigate to your account summary by clicking the user avatar in the top right of the home page.

Once directed to your account page, a prompt will likely appear suggesting you to enable 2FA, which happens to automatically pops up when a new user accesses this page.

Binance allows two methods for enabling 2FA, via SMS or Google Authenticator.

With the SMS version, simply enter your mobile phone number and the verification code sent to the corresponding phone and you will be all set.

If Google Authenticator is your 2FA of choice, download the mobile application, open it and scan the QR code provided by Binance. Next, you will be asked to write down a 16-word recovery phrase to be used as a backup in case you lose access to this google authentication.

Lastly, you will be prompted to enter your account’s login password and the authenticator code found in the Google Authenticator mobile app. Once complete, this form of 2FA security will be complete.

['Chris Cronimund'],,https://static.coindesk.com/static/chunks/images/facebook-cd851abcf9cbd3f39aaafc2c0a54009d.png,"If you are interested in buying or selling a cryptocurrency, there are few better places to look than one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trade volume, Binance.

Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao – who earned the number-one spot on CoinDesk’s 2018 Most Influential list – Binance rose to prominence during the historic crypto market-wide bull run in 2017 by supporting a wide array of cryptocurrencies in what was, and perhaps still is, one of the fastest and most reliable trading platforms.

In fact, Binance became so popular, so quickly that CZ and Binance both became worth more than $1 billion in less than one year, officially making it one of the first companies to achieve “unicorn” status in the cryptocurrency industry.

Yet despite its reputation as a destination for crypto traders, it’s not exactly easy for users who lack a traditional trading or investment background to navigate their way around.

In this piece, we take a step-by-step look at how to use Binance and conduct a trade on the exchange.

Signing up

First thing’s first, you’ll need to create an account. Anyone is able to sign up since Binance does not require customer information, but by doing so “you acknowledge and declare that you are not on any trade or economic sanctions lists” as per its Terms of Use.

This includes citizens of the member countries in the UN Security Council Sanctions list, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC), among other groups.

The terms also state each user must be at least 18 years of age. Binance reserves the right to cancel or freeze any account If the terms are disobeyed.

If the restrictions do not apply to you, to sign up simply navigate to the homepage and click register.

You will then be asked to enter a minimal amount of personal information such as your email address, password, and a referral ID if you have one.

As per Binance’s referral system, you will receive 50 percent of your referrals trading fees.

After you fill in the required fields, click “Register” and complete the captcha, a confirmation link will be sent to your email address.

Once the link is clicked, your Binance account is ready to be used.

Deposit Funds

Now that your account is activated, but before exploring the rest of the exchange, you’ll need to add funds to your account if you wish to buy or sell any cryptocurrencies.

Pay with credit card

Binance has a feature that allows users to purchase certain cryptocurrencies directly with their Visa or Mastercard credit card. If you are a qualified candidate, navigate to the “Funds” tab and select “Buy With Credit Card.”

You will then be required to enter the purchase amount of the desired cryptocurrency and whether you will be paying with the US dollar or euro. Cryptocurrency purchases by credit card are limited to BTC, ETH, and LTC at this time.

There is a minimum processing fee of $10 or 3.5 percent of the total order – whichever is more expensive. After completing this step, you will need to confirm your billing information, email address as well as your identity.

A valid government issued form of ID is required to be submitted to confirm your identity.

Once all of the required steps have been completed, the newly purchased cryptocurrency should reach your Binance wallet within 10-30 minutes.

Deposit from wallet

You can also make a deposit by sending funds from a separate cryptocurrency wallet into your Binance account.

In order to do this, navigate to the “Funds” tab once again and click “Balances.”

On this page, you will see all of the cryptocurrencies available for trading on Binance. To deposit the corresponding crypto into any of these, simply click the “Deposit” button next to the crypto asset of your choice.

Next, either scan the QR code from your cryptocurrency wallet or paste in the address and then send.

Once that’s complete, wait for the transaction to process and you’ll be ready for trading.

Placing a trade

Let’s go back to the home page now that your funds are ready to be used.

Here, you will again see all the cryptocurrencies that are tradable on Binance and their respective markets.

For this example, let’s say you previously deposited 0.0024 BTC (~$10) into your account and now wish to trade it for NEO.

First, you’ll need to find the right NEO market.

Since you want to spend BTC in order to get NEO, click the “BTC Markets” tab and then type NEO into the search bar.

Click the appropriate row and the page where trading takes place will open.

Trading module

This page may look intimidating, but you can easily get the hang of it with a bit of practice.

Plus, most cryptocurrency exchanges have a similar trading interface so what you remember here, in all likelihood, will be relevant elsewhere.

The left section of the screen is known as an order book.

Here, you will see all active buy and sell limit orders. A limit order is simply an order that will only be placed at the user’s desired price, given there are buyers or sellers interested at that level.

If you would like to learn the “in’s and out’s” of an order book, check out our comprehensive guide, but for now all you need to know is that the top of the order book (red) is where the limit sell orders wait to be filled and the bottom section (green) is where the limit buy orders wait to be filled.

The right side of the page is more simple – the above section shows the other cryptocurrencies that can be traded and the lower section shows the public trade history of the market currently being viewed.

Trade example: Buying NEO

The center of the page is where the real magic happens.

Here lays a chart feature that shows real-time price action and technical analysis indicators. Just below the chart is where you will actually execute the trade, so let’s buy some NEO.

If certainty of execution is your priority, select market order. If you are interested in only buying at a specific price level, select either limit or stop-limit order.

For the purposes of this example, let’s place a market order, which will be placed immediately at current market prices.

Now, just enter the amount of BTC desired to be spent and how much NEO you want to purchase. Binance has a useful shortcut for entering the purchase amount and it is based on a percentage of your bitcoin balance (or any other appropriate trading pair).

Let’s spend 50 percent of the BTC balance so there is some left over, perhaps for another trade.

The last step is to click the big green button “Buy NEO.” Since this is a market order, the trade for 0.58 NEO should have completed instantly, but that is most likely not the case if you selected limit or stop-limit order.

To check on the status of your order, look towards the bottom of the page where it says “Open order.” As the title would suggest, if your order has not yet executed, in other words, is still “open,” it will appear in this box until it has either been canceled or filled.

When it has been filled, it will show up in the lower box highlighting your 24-hour order history, just as how this order has below.

In order to sell, simply follow this same process but execute a market or limit sell order.

Withdrawing funds

While Binance does have a decentralized exchange in the works, the existing platform is centralized and susceptible to hacks like many other websites, so it’s recommended funds are only held on the exchange for as long as necessary.

In order to withdraw, navigate back to the “Balances” page. If you would like to see only the cryptocurrencies you have a substantial balance in, check the “hide” box.

Now select the withdrawal button in the NEO row and have your destination address or QR code handy. Paste the address and select how much you want to withdraw.

According to an excerpt from the firm’s upcoming “2021 Crypto Crime Report,” published Monday, online marketplaces providing illegal goods like drugs and fake IDs received a record-setting amount of cryptocurrency last year, equivalent to $1.7 billion. Russia, the U.S., Ukraine and China were the main areas of global money traffic to such platforms.

Darknet marketplaces receive most of their money through peer-to-peer crypto marketplaces and centralized exchanges, Chainalysis wrote. However, in 2020, the use of centralized exchanges increased, as did mixing services, which allow to obfuscate the participants in a cryptocurrency transaction.

Drug deal distribution

The report lists 10 countries where people are most actively interacting with dark markets: Russia, the U.S., Ukraine, China, the U.K., Venezuela, Vietnam, Turkey, India and Germany. Together, these nations were the source of $538 million to illicit markets during 2020 while people there received $403 million, Chainalysis said.

Russians sent around $169 million to the various darknet marketplaces, and received $119 million from such sites. Americans were second, with $115 million sent and $64 million received. In third place, Ukrainians sent $47 million and received $52 million.

“Generally speaking, drugs are grown or manufactured in Latin America and Asia and consumed in North America and Northern & Western Europe,” the report reads. “Darknet vendors and administrators typically launder funds through cryptocurrency services – often over-the-counter (OTC) brokers – in China or Eastern Europe. We can see some of this activity in the blockchain data associated with darknet market transactions.”

Dominant player

The biggest marketplace in the field by far is Hydra, a Russian-language drug marketplace that pocketed 75% of the entire global dark market revenue, Chainalysis said. Hydra was mostly responsible for the rapid growth in the global dark market revenue over the last year, while the income of other marketplaces didn’t change significantly between 2019 and 2020.

Hydra delivers drugs to buyers via “drops,” in which a delivery person hides the purchase close to a buyer and shares the geolocation of the package so it can be collected. In December 2019, Hydra announced it wanted to expand to other regions of the world and would hold a $146 million token sale. This was later put on hold due to the global coronavirus pandemic.

According to the data from Bitfury’s data firm Crystal Blockchain, currently, Hydra’s bitcoin addresses hold more than 521 BTC, worth over $18 million. Since 2011, Hydra has sent and received more than 439,000 BTC ($15.2 billion).

Data limitations

Chainalysis has been researching the various aspects of geography of cryptocurrency use for several years, although the firm admits locating such activity on the globe is a tricky task and such research has its limitations.

To see where in the world crypto markets are most active, Chainalysis looks into such data as web traffic on the particular services via SimilarWeb, time zones in which transactions take place, fiat currencies involved, languages and the location of the headquarters of the services, the firm’s head of research, Kim Grauer, told CoinDesk for a previous report on cryptocurrency adoption around the globe.","['dominate', 'report', 'dark', 'marketplaces', 'russia', 'cryptocurrency', 'market', 'hydra', 'traffic', 'received', 'global', 'sent', 'services', 'chainalysis', 'million']","People in Russia and the U.S. were the source of over $284 million to illicit online marketplaces in 2020, blockchain research firm Chainalysis said in its latest report.

In traditional markets, European and Asian shares rose and U.S. stock futures pointed toward a higher open amid renewed optimism for economic stimulus and the distribution of coronavirus vaccines. GameStop shares lost nearly a third of their value on Monday following last week’s 400% short squeeze.

Silver, whose price had shot up to an eight-year high after a series of posts on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum calling for a “short squeeze,” tumbled as some commenters pushed back against the narrative; precious-metals analysts for the lenders HSBC and Commerzbank warned the rally would be hard to sustain. Gold weakened 0.6% to $1,849 an ounce.

Market Moves

With the coronavirus vaccine distribution well underway, Wall Street analysts are sketching out what the economy might look like as 2021 unfolds and social-distancing measures recede.

The short answer is that activity is set to heat up, which could also provide the first real test of the hidden inflationary pressures that might have built up over the past year. Whatever happens will likely prove crucial for the bitcoin market because the cryptocurrency has become one of the most popular ways for big investors to bet on the likelihood of rising prices or dollar debasement.

The U.S. Congressional Budget Office projected on Monday that gross domestic product will expand by 3.7% this year, after a 2.5% contraction in 2020. But Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. lender, is even more optimistic, recently boosting its forecast for this year’s growth to 6%, from 4.5% at the start of the year.

A key question for the inflation watchers, of course, is just how much stimulus money will be pumped into the economy by the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve.

President Joe Biden has proposed a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill, but a group of senators from the opposition Republican party on Monday released details of a $618 billion proposal they argue is more appropriate. Bank of America’s analysts assume the package will end up around $1 trillion.

Why it matters is that as Americans start to get out and about, a surge in consumer spending looks likely. The Bank of America analysts estimate there’s already some $1.6 trillion of excess savings that might start to trickle into the economy.

“The jolt from stimulus, the support of excess savings and the green light from lower virus cases should unleash pent-up consumer spending,” the Bank of America economists wrote. “Stronger growth means a lower unemployment rate and greater inflation pressure.”

That outlook raises the question of how the Fed might respond, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell stating last week that it’s “too early to be talking about dates“ for tapering the central bank’s $120-billion-a-month of bond purchases – funded via printing more money – that are currently ongoing to provide stimulus to financial markets.

By the middle of this year, if the economy is recovering quickly Powell and his colleagues might find it harder to characterize any talk of tapering as still too soon. Because these are typically well-telegraphed affairs, the actual tapering might start six to seven months after that. Call it early 2022.

“We believe the Fed will have difficulty justifying persistently large asset purchases in the face of a sustainable decrease in [COVID-19] cases, economic overheating, and frothy asset prices,” according to Bank of America.

On the other hand, the Fed might flinch.

“We can envision a scenario whereby the Fed signals an intention to taper/starts tapering, markets react negatively, and the Fed finds that they need to continue purchasing or extend the duration of their purchases in order to preserve market functioning,” according to Bank of America.

It’s that latter scenario – or even just the prospect of it – that might drive bitcoin prices a lot higher. Based on the reluctance of central bankers to withdraw stimulus, not to mention the market lurches late last year when a new U.S. stimulus bill seemed in doubt, the scenario isn’t all that implausible.

Bitcoin’s ongoing range play between $30,000 and $40,000 could end with a bullish breakout as demand from investors continues to outstrip new supplies of the cryptocurrency.

In 2021 so far, around 26,000 new bitcoins have been produced by miners on the Bitcoin blockchain, data provider Glassnode said in a weekly report. Yet, in the same period, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has acquired over 40,000 BTC. (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.)

In another bullish indicator, the number of coins held on exchange addresses continues to slide, interpreted as a sign of waning interest from sellers. The balance of bitcoin held across all exchanges fell to a 2.5-year low of 2,349,040 on Monday, according to Glassnode.

On the bearish side, a stronger dollar could play spoilsport to any push higher. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback’s value against major currencies, is looking north, with price charts showing a major bullish pattern known an “inverse head-and-shoulders breakout.”

“If a bullish trend develops from DXY’s latest breakout, it could be a problem for bitcoin,” trader and analyst Alex Kruger told CoinDesk.

The spillover to digital markets from the past week’s GameStop saga has taken on a new form: Soaring demand for digital tokens associated with cryptocurrency exchanges and the arcane but fast-growing arena of decentralized finance, known as DeFi, which could provide an alternative to Wall Street and traditional trading platforms.

“It seems investors are looking for the next trade to cycle through,” Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the cryptocurrency exchange firm EQUOS, wrote Tuesday in a note to clients.

The exchange Binance’s in-house BNB token hit a new all-time high on Monday, just days after rival FTX’s FTT token logged a new record, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reported.

Prices have also hit new highs for tokens from decentralized exchanges, which are essentially just automated, blockchain-based software protocols that can be used to trade digital assets. Uniswap’s UNI and SushiSwap’s SUSHI both saw big price jumps – a dynamic that might reflect retail investors’ growing concerns with centralized trading platforms amid widespread anger over Robinhood’s trading suspensions last week. Trading volumes on the decentralized exchanges,, hit a record above $50 billion in January, CoinDesk’s Zack Voell reported.

Ether, the native blockchain of the Ethereum blockchain, where much of the DeFi development is taking place, has pushed back toward a record high above $1,400.

“Decentralized trading, decentralized lending, decentralized insurance, decentralized everything starts to make a lot more sense in light of what is happening today in the traditional financial system,” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of the cryptocurrency-focused Arca Funds, wrote Monday in his weekly newsletter.

What's Hot

“It’s pretty obvious that the WSB traders are applying the same principles of the digital/CryptoAsset world to the stock market and they are loving the fact that the old schoolers are hating it,” billionaire Mark Cuban writes in a blog post. (CoinDesk)

Coinbase has reportedly tapped Nasdaq for its planned direct listing, according to The Block. Existing Coinbase investors have already been trading shares through Nasdaq’s Private Market platform, where the company has notched an implied valuation of $50 billion.

Winklevosses’ Gemini crypto exchange inks partnership with crypto lender Genesis to give customers option to earn up to 7.4% annual interest on holdings, CoinDesk’s Nathan DiCamillo reported. The new offering aims to lure away customers turned off by “anemic” interest rates from traditional banks, Gemini COO Noah Perlman said. According to DiCamillo, the annual yield is consistent with what’s typically seen among centralized crypto lenders but pales in comparison to yield farming interest rates in decentralized finance (DeFi), which are much higher but more erratic. (Genesis is another CoinDesk sister company.)

The latest on the economy and traditional finance

Robinhood has raised $3.4 billion from investors over the past several days, CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson reported. The online trading platform’s backers are apparently looking past the blowback from Robinhood’s trading suspensions amid the peak of the runup in prices for GameStop, AMC and other “meme stocks.” CFO Jason Warnick said the cash infusion will help Robinhood “scale to meet the incredible growth we’ve seen and demand for our platform.” Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev is expected to testify before the U.S. House of Representatives’ financial-services committee on Feb. 18, CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair reported.

Even before the pandemic hit, global debt was at a far higher level than before the financial crisis of 2008, according to the International Monetary Fund. The figure reached $197 trillion at the end of 2019, for a debt-to-GDP ratio of 226%, according to an International Monetary Fund blog post on Monday. That compares with a ratio of 193% in 2007. But because of unusually accommodative monetary policies (i.e., interest rates set at close to zero or even negative levels), the average debt expense as a share of revenue was 0.3 percentage points lower in 2019, according to the IMF. With U.S. government debt alone rising by about $4 trillion to about $27 trillion, the year-end 2020 numbers are likely to look a lot uglier.

In short, it brings a combination of bank-grade custody and post-trade settlement to crypto.

“There is very little institutional-grade infrastructure within digital. In fact, I’m gobsmacked at how little there is,” said Cobalt Chairman Adrian Patten. “Also, I’ve noticed that in the crypto world everyone concentrates on the coin, the crypto bit. They forget the dollar. Whether that’s from a risk management perspective, management of collateral or settlement, that’s always the thing that holds them back.”

Specifically, the partnership involves integrating METACO’s institutional operating system for digital assets, SILO, with Cobalt’s interoperable FX and digital assets platform to offer a fully integrated end-to-end SaaS solution for the storage, limit allocation and intraday settlement of digital assets, per a press release.

“There’s a lot of friction in the market still,” said Seamus Donoghue, VP of sales and business development at METACO. “When you trade on exchanges or with counterparts in general, you have to pre-fund those positions. That’s capital intensive. There’s a counterparty risk there as well, and it’s just not a very efficient market.”

BBVA, StanChart and more

Between them the two firms have a hand in most of the major crypto banking plays happening in Europe right now. METACO is working on crypto custody with Standard Chartered, BBVA, DBS Bank and Gazprombank Switzerland. Cobalt is also involved with Standard Chartered and has other projects in the pipeline involving the likes of ErisX and LMAX Digital.

Cobalt’s Patten pointed out that banks and many regulated buy-side firms need certain processes and ways of doing things. “You can’t go settling a transaction on the back of emails. Which is what happens,” he said.

But it’s not just institutions looking for better digital asset trading infrastructure. Many of the largest crypto exchanges are in talks with the firms too, Patten said.

“Over 75% of our pipeline is crypto firms looking to upgrade their processes,” Patten said. “They’re having massive increases of volume and volatility, and they realize you can’t carry on doing it in this way. We’re going to be signing a bunch of these firms up in the first quarter.”","['firms', 'exchanges', 'patten', 'metaco', 'crypto', 'cobalt', 'infrastructure', 'banks', 'assets', 'thats', 'digital', 'trading', 'settlement', 'upgrade']","Announced Tuesday, METACO and Cobalt are launching a software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering that covers the full gamut of institutional trading requirements for digital assets.

“We have a lot of customers who look at the interest rate in traditional finance, which is pretty anemic,” said Noah Perlman, Gemini’s chief operating officer. The company hopes to give customers a reason to keep their crypto on the Gemini platform. The product is in line with other traditional-looking crypto products such as the Gemini credit card launched earlier this year.

The APY is consistent with what’s typically seen among centralized crypto lenders, but pales in comparison to yield farming interest rates in decentralized finance (DeFi), which are much higher but more erratic. (Genesis is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)

The product is offered in all 50 states, including New York where Gemini has its trust license. Users can get yield on any cryptocurrency available on the Gemini platform now and on Gemini’s GUSD stablecoin at some point in the future. The product is open to active Gemini customers currently and will be rolled out to all Gemini customers later this month.

Gemini collects part of the spread between interest paid on the crypto and interest Genesis charges on its loans to institutions. As part of the partnership, Gemini reviewed Genesis’ financial statements and verified that the lender’s loans are overcollateralized, said Yusuf Hussain, Gemini’s head of risk.

The cryptocurrency almost doubled in value over the weekend and clocked a two-month high earlier today. The price action suggests some traders bought XRP in anticipation of a price pump, inadvertently pushing it higher. Some of them may now be trapped on the wrong side of the market.

At press time, the exact reason for the price dump is not known. It’s quite possible that a whale (large investor) took advantage of the price rise and dumped his holdings. Pump and dump strategies are not new to crypto markets, particularly for XRP.

A Reddit post, which talked about a crowd-buying attack at 08:30 and how it could be successful, has now been removed by Ripple moderators. The Telegram group, however, is still active, where members are blaming exchange downtimes for the price drop.","['crashes', 'buying', 'telegram', 'pump', 'fails', 'days', '40', 'cryptocurrency', '0830', 'reached', 'twomonth', 'price', 'high', 'xrp', 'materialize']","XRP has crashed hard from a two-month high reached early Monday, with a planned community buying effort failing to yield desired results.

The move more than reversed the late-December price slide triggered by legal troubles at the San Francisco-based payment protocol developer Ripple Labs, which has close ties to the digital asset.

XRP rose to a high of $0.6836 during European trading hours, its highest level since Nov. 25, extending the weekend’s rally from $0.27 to $0.50, according to CoinDesk 20 data. As a result, the cryptocurrency has replaced the tether stablecoin as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market value.

XRP prices fell from $0.55 to $0.20 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced a lawsuit against Ripple Labs on Dec. 22, triggering a number of exchange delistings of the cryptocurrency. The regulator charged the company with violating securities laws by raising $1.3 billion over seven years from retail investors through its sales of XRP.

Ripple Labs pushed back against the SEC’s allegations on Friday, arguing the functionality and liquidity of XRP are wholly incompatible with securities regulation, and its registration as a security would impair its main utility in faster, cheaper and more transparent global payments.

The cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid on Saturday, rising 56% to register its biggest single-day gain in three years, and has remained on the offensive ever since.

A coordinated effort by the members of the two-day-old Telegram group called “Buy & Hold XRP” alongside calls to buy XRP by the r/SatoshiStreetBets group seems to have helped push the cryptocurrency to multi-month highs. At press time, the Telegram pump group had 200,000 members.

However, some observers are of the opinion the Telegram traders may not be the sole drivers of the price rise. “24H volume on XRP on Sunday was over $26 billion. Even if each of the groups’ members dropped $5,000 on XRP, that equates to 2% of total daily volume. Let’s be rational here – no Telegram group is pumping the 5th largest coin in the space,” popular Twitter-based analyst Credible Crypto tweeted Sunday.

The cryptocurrency is trading near $0.66 at press time, representing a nearly 30% gain on the day.

“XRP’s next target is $0.80, which, if breached, would allow a rally to $1 and higher,” Alex Melikhov, CEO and founder of cryptocurrency framework Equilibrium and the EOSDT stablecoin, told CoinDesk.

The double-digit price rise was likely fueled by members of a Telegram-based group called Buy & Hold XRP (t.me/pumpxrp), which came into existence on Saturday. The group’s membership hit Telegram’s 200,000 ceiling within the first 24 hours, forcing a migration to a new official channel with a similar title but a different link (t.me/pumpxrpofficial).

“Traditional Crypto-Pump groups are being copied and legitimized by WallStreetBets-style crowd-pumps, and are now turning their burning gaze from dogecoin to XRP,” Jehan Chu, co-founder and managing partner at Hong Kong-based Kenetic Capital, told CoinDesk.

Classic pump and dump tactics are not new to crypto, particularly for XRP, which has a strong army of followers. However, their morale may have been boosted by a group of amateur day traders based on a Reddit forum called WallStreetBets, who recently launched a coordinated buying attack on the video game retailer GameStop (GME), triggering a short squeeze and inflicting heavy losses for hedge funds.

GameStop surged nearly 400% last week, extending the preceding week’s 83% rise and attracting unwanted attention from regulators. Meanwhile, the meme-based cryptocurrency dogecoin surged 800% a day before XRP’s price pump. The data suggests the crowd buying tactics are returning to their home turf, having democratized the legacy markets.

The top cryptocurrency hit a peak price of $41,962 on Jan. 8 and has mostly traded the range of $29,000–$40,000 since then, according to CoinDesk 20 data.

However, demand continues to outstrip supply amid the price lull. “In 2021 so far, around 26,000 BTC have been mined. Meanwhile, the Grayscale Investment Trust has acquired over 40,000 BTC in the same period,” Glassnode said in its weekly report.

Further, the number of coins held on exchange addresses continues to slide, taking sell-side liquidity off the market.

The balance of bitcoin held across all exchanges fell to a 2.5-year low of 2,349,040 on Monday, according to Glassnode.

Meanwhile, the number of whale entities – clusters of crypto wallet addresses held by a single network participant holding at least 1,000 BTC – jumped to a new record high of 2,218 on Sunday. The count has increased by over 50 during the recent bout of price consolidation in a sign of continued accumulation by investors large enough to influence market trends.

Lastly, the odds of a deeper drop due to profit-taking appear low, as the 24-hour average of bitcoin’s adjusted spent output ratio (aSOPR), recently fell to 1.00, indicating that coins moving between investors are no longer carrying profit. The SOPR metric measures the profit ratio of coins based on the prices when they last moved. The aSOPR ignores all outputs with a lifespan of less than one hour.

Bitcoin's aSOPR Source: Glassnode

Investors typically sell at a loss during bear markets, but bitcoin is currently in a bull market, having rallied by 200% in the past three months.

“For SOPR to go lower, investors would have to be willing to sell at a loss, which is unlikely given the current shape of the market. We have been looking for this reset to generate some stability in the market and pave the way for the next bull run,” Glassnode recently said. Historically, values below 1.0 have been consistently rejected during bull markets.

So, the odds appear stacked in favor of a convincing bitcoin move above $40,000. “The breakout may happen in two weeks; everything is bullish now,” trader and analyst Alex Kruger told CoinDesk over Twitter.

Kruger, however, cited potential dollar strength as a short-term risk to bitcoin’s bullish outlook. The Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback’s value against major currencies, is looking north, with the daily chart reporting an inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) breakout – a major bullish pattern (below right).

“If a bullish trend develops from DXY’s latest breakout, it could be a problem for bitcoin,” Kruger said. The breakout has opened the doors for a rise to 93.00. The DXY is trading near 91.12 at press time, little changed on the day.

Matthew Dibb, COO and co-founder of Stack Funds, voiced similar concerns while drawing attention to the fact that bitcoin’s rally from early November lows near $14,000 happened alongside the DXY’s decline from 94.5 to 89.00.

Bitcoin has moved mainly in the opposite direction to the U.S. dollar since the March markets crash, with the cryptocurrency witnessing consolidation or pullbacks during bouts of strength in USD. Bitcoin’s recent decline from record highs and the subsequent consolidation has been accompanied by a recovery rally in the dollar.

The inverse correlation between the two is likely the result of the dollar’s negative correlation to the appetite for risk in the global financial markets.

“Whenever risk sentiment deteriorates around the globe there is a natural desire to move to safety in the form of the U.S. dollar. And by extension, bitcoin, which is still an emerging asset, is exposed to risk-off,” Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital, told CoinDesk.

However, the dollar’s overall trend looks bearish, courtesy of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s open-ended money printing strategy, and analysts remain confident about bitcoin’s long-term prospects.

“Both for the medium and long term, bitcoin remains attractive and, ultimately, on that longer-term proposition, bitcoin should become an in-demand currency during periods of risk-off,” Kruger said.","['renewed', 'risk', 'point', 'bullish', 'source', 'ahead', 'kruger', 'dollar', 'bitcoins', 'market', 'fundamentals', 'price', 'bitcoin', 'rally', 'breakout']","Bitcoin exchange balance Source: GlassnodeThe balance of bitcoin held across all exchanges fell to a 2.5-year low of 2,349,040 on Monday, according to Glassnode.

“I think we’ll see more interest in bitcoin again if we move solidly above $35,000,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for Swissquote Bank. “On the support side for bitcoin is institutional buying in the low $30,000s.”

Some exhaustion recently in the bitcoin market may have been caused by speculative activity in the stock market.

“So much attention has been on U.S. equities markets as of late, a lot of the mainstream and crypto outlets have been much less focused on driving the formation of opinions of traders and hodlers,” said John Willock, chief executive officer of crypto custody provider Tritum.

Equities on major indexes were all up Tuesday.

In addition to the bullish sentiment keeping stocks buoyant, it should be noted the price per 1 BTC has been able to stay above $30,000 for quite a while.

The last time bitcoin’s closing price was under $30,000, according to CoinDesk 20 data, was on New Year’s Day, when it closed at $29,333. It hasn’t looked back since.

“More than anything else, we should all take the long-term sustained price levels above the 2017 high of $20,000 now over a month as the best possible endorsement of bitcoin being a long-term bullish asset,” added Tritum’s Willock.

“Generally speaking, I think that the market is accepting higher prices while trying to digest the volatility,” noted Neil Van Huis, director of institutional trading at crypto liquidity provider Blockfills.

Bitcoin’s gyrations seem to have subsided somewhat, helped by a very flat weekend into Monday. As of Feb. 1, bitcoin’s 30-day volatility has trended downward; but it is still above 100%, which is quite high. The S&P 500, by comparison, has a 30-day volatility below 20%.

Jun Dam, a smart-contract developer who has written code on the Ethereum and Tron platforms, noted that many decentralized exchanges have numerous pairs with ETH, and speculates traders may be selling some of their stash for DeFi tokens. “It seems like total DEX volume has increased significantly in 2021,” Dam told CoinDesk.

“DeFi is definitely the flavor,” concurred Swissquote’s Thomas. “There’s still good value out there if you consider the possibility that more people will move to DEXs in the next 12 months [and that] arguably the DEXs are still undervalued.”

USDC on exchanges “represents almost $1 billion worth of buying power from USDC alone, poised to move into assets” such as bitcoin, according to Glassnode’s weekly newsletter dated Feb 1. “This high figure should increase investors’ confidence in any dips being quickly bought up, making it a bullish signal.”

As CoinDesk reported Tuesday, some analysts see several on-chain metrics for bitcoin’s price pointing in a bullish direction in the coming weeks. For example, a decreased amount of bitcoin held on exchange addresses indicates less pressure on the sell side.

In crypto trading, traders and investors often use stablecoins to put money into riskier cryptocurrencies; in such cases, buying stablecoins backed by government-issued currencies is seen as the first step necessary before buying other cryptocurrencies.

“The growth in on-exchange USDC reflects the increasing view among traders that USDC is a preferred base currency, as well as the fact that a lot of the new flows into crypto are starting with on-exchange activity,” Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of peer-to-peer payments company Circle, told CoinDesk through a spokesperson. He noted that USDC issuance in January saw “record levels.” Circle and crypto exchange Coinbase are behind USDC’s governing Centre consortium.

The circulating supply of USDC, which is valued 1:1 with the U.S. dollar, has grown to over 5 billion from just below 4 billion in the beginning of the month, sharp growth after slowing in October, according to data from Glassnode.

Increased exchange activity is also reflected in the significant price rise of exchanges’ utility tokens. Centralized exchanges Binance and FTX and decentralized exchanges Uniswap and SushiSwap all saw their exchange tokens hit new all-time highs in the past week.

As of press time, MakerDAO did not respond to CoinDesk’s requests for comment regarding its dai stablecoin.

The latest leg higher from $1,200 came alongside turmoil in the stock markets, where brokerage platforms like Robinhood have restricted transactions to rein volatility fueled by Reddit-based retail traders’ coordinated buying in stocks such as GameStop. The retail frenzy prompted by Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets forced hedge funds to unwind short bets in GameStop, leading to a 1,700% price rally in the 17 days to Jan. 28.

Crypto analysts believe the restrictive actions could bring more users into the DeFi space, which is dominated by Ethereum’s blockchain.

“With investment and trading platform Robinhood halting trading of certain assets like GameStop and Nokia (NOK), and Nasdaq President and CEO Adena Friedman calling for regulations to prevent retail investors from coordinating on social media, the case for cryptocurrencies only grows stronger,” Nicholas Pelecanos, head of trading at NEM Group, told CoinDesk.

According to Messari’s Ryan Selkis, the door for mass adoption of bitcoin, ethereum, DeFi and Web 3.0 assets has been flung open. “Buy ethereum to secure the fledging decentralized financial system and potentially make a lot of money, but also to tell your bank to f**k off,” Selkis noted in Thursday’s daily market brief.

IBM’s blockchain unit missed its revenue targets by a wide margin for two years in a row, said a second source. Expectations for enterprise blockchain were too high, they said, adding that IBM “didn’t really manage to execute, despite doing a lot of announcements.”

A spokesperson for IBM denied the claims.

“Our blockchain business is doing well, thank you,” Holli Haswell, a director of public relations at IBM, said via email. “We have realigned some leaders and business units to continue to drive growth – we do that every year.”

A former IBM staffer who had been working on enterprise blockchain, however, said there have been a succession of “Resource Actions,” or RAs, which basically means firing people based on business performance as opposed to personal performance.

“I would wager less than 10% [of the blockchain product and engineering team] is still working on IBM Blockchain,” said the ex-IBM source. “There have been tons of reorgs. Pretty much everyone is gone. IBM is now 100% focused on hybrid cloud, so everything that doesn’t support that is deprioritized.”

IBM has pumped a lot of money into blockchain since 2016, when it began talking about the technology’s potential to transform the way industries do business.

If IBM’s blockchain innovation work is now confined to some R&D, and does not even extend to consulting, as one of the sources said, this sounds an ominous note for the enterprise blockchain space in general – perhaps particularly for the Hyperledger collection of blockchains, to which IBM was a key contributor.

In its recent full-year results statement, IBM as a whole reported revenue fell 6% on an annualized basis. Looking back to its 2017 financial statement, IBM called itself the “blockchain leader for business.” All mention of the technology is now absent from the company’s statements.

No more TV commercials

In the past several years, IBM has pushed ahead with a series of blockchain networks built on Hyperledger Fabric. Big Blue’s major blockchain networks are FoodTrust, a farm-to-supermarket tracking system backed by Walmart; and TradeLens, a shipping container logistics blockchain backed by Maersk. IBM has also added the Trust Your Supplier network and previously had a go at payments via World Wire.

While cryptocurrencies and public blockchain networks appear to have flourished in 2020, the economic shock of COVID-19 has impacted innovation departments inside large firms, to the extent that areas not immediately generating revenue – such as blockchain – have been trimmed.

Another source, an enterprise blockchain engineer with former ties to IBM, estimated more than 100 blockchain-related jobs were cut at Big Blue over the last year.

The source also pointed out that Jerry Cuomo, IBM’s head of blockchain and an evangelist for the tech going back to 2016, has been moved and is now working on artificial intelligence.

“Jerry is indeed overseeing additional strategic, high-growth parts of the IBM business but is still involved in blockchain,” said Haswell, the company spokesperson. “He is a very senior technical leader and that is what we do in IBM – people’s roles expand.”

After publication of this article, Haswell further disputed the reporting, adding:

""IBM maintains a strong team dedicated to blockchain across the company. We have shifted some resources but remain committed to the technology, blockchain ecosystem and services. We see blockchain as a driver for our cloud business.""

On Jan. 7 the total cryptocurrency market hit an all-time high exceeding $1 trillion for the first time. Renewed interest in, and conversations around, blockchain technology and digital currencies from industry and government leaders have accompanied the rise.

At the same time, the challenges of 2020 continue, including the global pandemic. COVID-19 dominated the recent Davos agenda, with the need for digital solutions and real-time multi-party access to consistent information highlighted across multiple sectors.

At the World Economic Forum, we will continue to work with hundreds of experts from governments, business, civil society and academia to bring together the seemingly disparate worlds of crypto and long-standing institutions.

Sheila Warren is the Head of Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology at the World Economic Forum.

Here are some of the top trends we are watching this year:

Identity

All eyes are on digital identity for COVID-related needs – but long-term strategies and implications remain to be seen.

The COVID-19 crisis has increased consumer demand for identity solutions that don’t compromise individual privacy and freedoms. Of course, ideas of what constitutes the ideal level of privacy preservation vary widely around the world, with China and the U.S. taking deeply divergent perspectives. As the travel industry and various governments continue to explore ideas like “immunity passports,” which would maintain vaccination and/or testing records, the creation of a global standard around digital credentialing seems both necessary and elusive.

In addition, what does it mean to anchor on digital identity as a reaction to a very specific set of circumstances (namely an unprecedented global pandemic)? Digital identity systems are relevant for everything from financial services to re-skilling workforces, which each have distinct requirements. Focusing on one sector without taking a longer-term view can mean that we lose out on opportunities, duplicate efforts and create more complicated user experiences.

As it stands, there are very few regulations or industry standards to prevent fragmentation of technical solutions, protect privacy or promote inclusivity, interoperability and portability – all essential principles – for digital credentialing beyond time-sensitive use cases. As global society struggles to return to “normal,” there is a need to ensure potential solutions that embrace the use of digital credentials, leverage the experience of the digital identity community, consider a longer-term and holistic view, and create strong partnerships with public authorities.

Institutional adoption

Last year was the year of “institutional investment” in bitcoin – a buzzy phrase that was seen across pundit analyses of the crypto rallies, referring to large-scale investments of players such as MassMutual and Square (SQ). It is likely that financial institutions and service providers will intensify their own experiments with, and use of, cryptocurrency this year, whether via investment or actual deployment.

In some instances, they are also being used for improving internal processes. For example, in a Davos agenda panel Hikmet Ersek, CEO of Western Union, cited the company’s use of a stable “WU Coin” to exchange different currencies, done “21 times every second.”

COVID-19 also raised the profile of the conversation around central bank digital currencies’ exploration of blockchain technology. We saw the launch of some of the first national-level blockchain-based systems, including in the Bahamas and Cambodia. At the same time, progress around China’s DCEP (Digital Currency/Electronic Payment) continued in the background, with the People’s Bank of China having completed pilots in Shenzhen, Xiong’an and Suzhou, processing RMB 1.1 billion across 3.1 million transactions.

Still, many governments and central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, continue to research whether central bank digital currencies (CBDC) hold potential but have maintained they do not see value in issuing one at this time. Many are also watching the growth in the stablecoin space – with total value now surpassing $25 billion – fueled by decentralized finance (DeFi) and institutional interest. This has corresponded with increased attention from regulators, for instance the controversial STABLE Act in the U.S. and the recent letter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. We can expect continued regulatory interest and activity in this area from around the world.

NFTs boost inclusive wealth

We have come a long way since CryptoKitties, yet relatively little progress has been made in realizing the potential of non-fungible tokens (a cryptocurrency token that is indivisible and unique) outside of the gaming context.

But we are already seeing shifts around the dialogue of inclusion. Previously, there was talk of democratizing access to high-value assets, such as art. While there still might be potential here, it’s important to consider the implications for creators as well. For instance, some have spotlighted black artists and the role that crypto art can play in allowing for greater ownership and wealth creation within the space, as well as art exchanges. We’ve also seen early signs of how this may translate to music or writing.

Decentralized infrastructure

Awareness of the power that centralized platforms and service providers wield over our lives is moving beyond the crypto and blockchain community to the mainstream. Take, for example, the recent mass exodus from WhatsApp to Signal following a (relatively minor) change in Facebook’s data-sharing policies.

This may create an increase in demand for decentralized service provision. In 2020, we saw the highly anticipated launch of Filecoin from Protocol Labs and continued growth of Web 3.0 projects such as Keep, Oasis and Polkadot. The public cloud market is among the most highly concentrated in existence, with four providers controlling 80% of the market. Decentralized cloud storage is currently the only alternative that could pose a challenge to this status quo. Along with advances in AI, this transition could lead to significant expansion of the scope of human and machine interaction, and an acceleration of the transition to Web 3.0.

Even as we have been wrestling with the consequences of the greatest social and economic disruption of our lifetimes, the pace of work across the blockchain ecosystem has been accelerating. The great news is that awareness of the potential of decentralized systems now lives beyond the minds of a tiny minority and is slowly gaining awareness among a larger audience (although the bitcoin price index remains the biggest reason most people pay any attention to the space).","['potential', 'sheila', 'blockchain', 'solutions', 'digital', 'crypto', 'trends', 'im', 'identity', 'warren', 'continue', 'currencies', 'global', 'decentralized', 'watching']","Renewed interest in, and conversations around, blockchain technology and digital currencies from industry and government leaders have accompanied the rise.

The vote went live on the web app Snapshot on Jan. 28 and ended today at 18:00 UTC (1 p.m. ET).

Yearn Finance is a collectively designed robo-advisor for yield that is fast becoming a portal into all of DeFi. It’s governed by the token YFI, which is worth slightly more than $30,000, as of this writing.

There’s a total of 30,000 YFI in existence, per the project’s original “fair launch.” If the new tokens were minted right now and had no impact on the market capitalization, then one would expect the value of YFI to drop to something like $25,000 (meaning the new tokens would be worth $167 million), but these things are not predictable.

The final vote to increase the supply was 1,670 YFI for versus 331 against.

To participate in a vote, YFI holders have to stake to the governance contract in advance of a vote by a specified Ethereum block number. The total amount of YFI staked to vote on YIP-57 was 4,089.

Final changes are approved by six of the nine members of the Yearn multisig, which is something like the DeFi equivalent of a board of directors.

Under the proposal, 33% of the new tokens would be set aside for key contributors. Which contributors the allocation would be for and how much each would get is unknown. There will be some sort of staking set up so contributors only get their allocations for sticking around, but none of that has been decided.

The other 66% will be set aside as a treasury, for everything from protocol acquisition to further development.

The decision marks a clear shift for the team, which accrued a unique amount of buzz for eschewing the convention of setting aside governance tokens for insiders.

The authors of the newly passed proposal wrote:

""Yearn's launch was exceptional at creating a decentralized and engaged community, but it did not provide adequate incentives to retain existing and future contributors on an ongoing basis, nor did it provide the protocol with a war chest to fund future activities.""

The community remains somewhat divided on the initiative. As the vote indicates, though, most YFI holders are for it.

On the supporter side, user zkwaffles wrote:

""This seems to be the equivalent of an equity raising round. In these rounds an early-stage venture will issue equity and in effect dilute current shareholders. ... The overarching idea being that the cash raised will increase future value enough to offset any dilution.""

On the opposition, user laur_science argued the proposal wasn’t specific enough:

""I don't like it, so I voted against. It doesn't even specify what type of vesting we're talking about. I want it to be for 5 years, equal amounts per year.""","['contributors', '20', 'yfi', 'set', 'future', 'finance', 'defi', 'yearn', 'inflate', 'community', 'votes', 'tokens', 'vote', 'supply', 'token', 'proposal']","The Yearn Finance community has been discussing expanding the supply of YFI as a way to compensate the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform’s de facto staffers.

Balancer, a non-custodial portfolio manager, is releasing version 2.0, which puts all the assets entrusted to it in one big vault. This should dramatically reduce gas fees for decentralized finance (DeFi) trades because users can swap as much as they want, only paying gas for going into and out of Balancer.

The team had considered building it this way from the start but decided initially to be conservative and separate out each pool for added security, CEO Fernando Martinelli told CoinDesk.

“We are today … comfortable enough with having a big vault that holds a lot of money. We put a lot of effort into making this as safe as if the assets were siloed,” he wrote in an email. “Many other protocols (not AMMs) already do this: lending protocols, collateral in MakerDAO, etc.”

Balancer works much like (and can serve the function of) an automated market maker (AMM) like Uniswap or Curve but it allows users to create pools of multiple tokens, weighted as they see fit. The pools automatically rebalance as needed in order to stay in line with the market.

This requires making a lot of transactions, which in turn require a lot of Ethereum gas fees. That is not capital-efficient for traders nor for liquidity pool providers, especially as gas prices tick upward.

In this new version, the accounting for those pools will just be done in smart contracts separate from the big custody pool.

One big pool

With Balancer v2, no matter how complex a trade or trades, “only the final net token amounts are transferred from and to the vault, saving a significant amount of gas in the process,” Martinelli wrote in an announcement post. Balancer can keep track of all of the assets entrusted to it in one vault and just move allocations around on people’s accounts.

“Now, token management and accounting is done by the vault while the AMM logic is individual to each pool. Because pools are contracts external to the vault, they can implement any arbitrary, customized AMM logic,” the team wrote.

In fact, the new version will even take it a step further. Active traders can set up an individual account so they can make lots of trades. Then they will only be charged gas fees when they want to withdraw.

Of course, that may sound more like a centralized exchange to some traders, which is somewhat fair. The key difference here is it’s all being kept on smart contracts that can be reviewed by the public; and, as an Ethereum project, its functionality can be easily integrated into others.

It does raise a security concern. To oversimplify it, think of it this way: If someone had a large treasure of gold, it would be trickier to steal it all if it were locked away in multiple vaults in different places rather than one big vault.

Martinelli does not dispute this, but he also notes that the more-complex logic in Balancer doesn’t touch the assets, which should be reassuring.

“Since the operations the vault will be doing are very low-level (add to a user balance, remove from a pool the user traded with), we will make everything (including formal verification) to make sure the vault is safe and sound,” Martinelli said via email.

Other developments

Balancer is adding some other features in version 2.0 that may be of interest to more advanced users. Crucially, it wants to make it easier to experiment with composition pools.

“Balancer v2 pioneers customizable AMM logic: [I]t effectively creates a launch pad for teams to innovate with different AMM strategies without having to worry about low level token transfers, balance accounting, security checks [and] smart order routing,” the announcement says.

It will go live with the familiar weighted pools that Balancer users know already. It will also have stable pools that work more as Curve does, so big trades on stablecoins can see very little slippage. Soon, Balancer will launch smart pools, whose logic can change on the fly.

Balancer will also introduce asset managers, external smart contracts that can be used to put some of a liquidity pools’ underlying value to work elsewhere in DeFi. This should be good for liquidity providers, because as the team notes, “in normal trading conditions, most of the assets in an AMM are not actually used.”

Balancer will also introduce trading fees that can be controlled by holders of its BAL token. It will offer fees on trades, withdrawals and flash loans. Only the final fee will be active at the start of version 2.0, however. BAL holders can use the fees either to pay for further development, for a dividend or some combination of both.

Balancer was one of the earliest projects to join the liquidity mining craze this summer, launching BAL distributions to users shortly after COMP distributions went live. Like on Compound, BAL liquidity mining has never stopped.

“We are currently discussing with the community some interesting updates to BAL liquidity mining. It will certainly continue though: it’s our main way to make sure we have a diverse and engaged governance,” Martinelli noted.","['vault', 'fees', 'gas', 'version', 'liquidity', 'pool', 'pools', 'users', 'transactions', 'cuts', 'balancers', 'balancer', 'big', 'amm']","Balancer, a non-custodial portfolio manager, is releasing version 2.0, which puts all the assets entrusted to it in one big vault.

In light of Robinhood’s disabling of buying in a number of stocks, there is a lot of fury about potential conflicts of interest that are not new but now suddenly in the spotlight.

The situation emphasizes the need for transparency in markets and why certain marketing that appears beneficial – “Trade stocks for free!” – may have deleterious characteristics under some circumstances.

Matthew Trudeau, chief Operating Officer at ErisX, has participated in the successful launch of 12 electronic trading venues. Prior to ErisX, Matthew was most recently co-founder and president of Tradewind Markets, an electronic trading platform and blockchain-based post trade system for physical precious metals.

In a practice known as “payment for order flow,” or PFOF, brokers sell their clients’ order flow to professional trading firms called “internalizers.” This practice has been covered by the media many times over the years, more recently by Institutional Investor and MSN. Brokers send individual investors’ orders, e.g., to buy stock in GameStop, to the internalizers that pay to trade against this “dumb flow.” The internalizers then net-offset the retail trades, keeping the spread, or offset trades on the national stock exchanges, presumably at a profit that exceeds the cost of their payments made to Robinhood and other retail brokers. The majority of retail equities orders never execute on an actual stock exchange.

So, retail traders trade for “free” and the brokers and professional internalizers still make lots of money. Not all market makers support PFOF. The question retail traders should be asking is, how much in hidden fees are they paying? If the non-transparent markups, spreads, or opportunity costs are greater than an explicit and transparent trade commission, then “free” may be pretty misleading. How fees and conflicts are disclosed and managed, or not, is pretty important. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seems to agree.

Well, good thing this only happens in equity trading. Crypto must be free of these conflicts, right?

Not exactly.

There is a lot of lip service paid to “democratizing access.” Call us fundamentalists, but when we envision a “democratized market” we envision an exchange where all members can trade with all other members according to a common set of rules and standards.

If the non-transparent markups, spreads or opportunity costs are greater than an explicit and transparent trade commission, then 'free' may be pretty misleading.

It’s a market where price discovery and liquidity are available to all on equal terms, and where the commingling of order flows from many different participants with diverse market outlooks and time horizons produce a better market quality. A central limit order book (CLOB), the model most typically found on regulated futures and stock exchanges such as the CME and Nasdaq, provides such a market structure (as we discussed here and here). On a CLOB, with a published price schedule and displayed quotations, the full cost of a trade is explicit and transparent: the price at which investors can purchase or sell a quantity of an asset plus the transaction fee. It is really pretty simple.

It does not strike us as very “democratic” when order flow gets channeled to exclusive liquidity providers that gain an informational advantage as a result of that exclusivity, particularly where that conflict is not well disclosed. Almost without fail, if a trading or pricing arrangement is not fully transparent there is, at worst, a problem or conflict. Or, as may be the case with unregulated/offshore markets, something untoward may be happening. At best there is an arrangement the parties would rather keep quiet from their products, er, customers.

As a new asset, crypto has had the opportunity to learn from the market structure examples of traditional markets. Unfortunately, some of the lessons that have ported over are sub-optimal arrangements rather than best practices.

An apparently significant part of the crypto market structure involves brokers sending client orders to over-the-counter “trading venues,” in that model a synonym for internalizing dealers. Or, in some cases, the broker is the dealer. (It is worth noting that in traditional markets there are strict rules that generally prohibit or restrict exchanges and brokers trading against their own clients.) OTC liquidity provision is a variation on the PFOF model. Instead of all-to-all trading with the explicit and transparent fees CLOBs enable, the OTC liquidity model replicates the implicit costs, informational advantages, opacity and potential conflicts of interest that have been problematic in equities and FX trading.

The Robinhood saga also exposes another risk of the exclusive liquidity provider model: counterparty risk. There has been a lot of speculation about why Robinhood disabled the buying of certain stocks. We will not wade into that discussion, but it does beg the question of what happens when the liquidity providers cannot or will not provide the liquidity, or cannot or will not settle trades. A CLOB diversifies counterparties and a clearinghouse eliminates settlement risk. These are proven market infrastructures that were designed in response to past market failures and disruptions.","['trade', 'order', 'matthew', 'crypto', 'alltoall', 'brokers', 'model', 'transparent', 'retail', 'market', 'markets', 'trudeau', 'liquidity', 'arent', 'trading']","Matthew Trudeau, chief Operating Officer at ErisX, has participated in the successful launch of 12 electronic trading venues.

“We think one of the biggest problems that need to be tackled exists on decentralized exchanges,” said Shumo Chu, CEO and co-founder of Manta Network, in an email.

“The volume is large and increasing on decentralized exchanges, but DEXs are also a hotbed for front-running opportunities due to the transparent nature of the blockchain. Someone can see your transaction before it gets written and confirmed, and make the same transaction with a higher fee to get priority and pass that transaction before you do.”

Privacy in DeFi

According to the survey, nearly three-quarters of the 404 respondents (73.2%) “have either hesitated or completely avoided making a transaction in the past because they were worried about the privacy implications of that transaction.”

Additionally, 84% of respondents expressed concern about their wallet addresses being linked to their real identity. Part of this concern was caused due to the fact that the nature of blockchains allows people to see address balances.

In fact, over 90% of survey respondents said they’d looked up someone’s wallet address to view that person’s holdings and/or transactions.

The survey adds further weight to the notion that privacy is a central concern in the cryptocurrency space, and the Manta Network is one of a number of different projects in the DeFi space working to increase privacy functionality.

The Manta Network

The Manta Network aims to bolster privacy in DeFi, in part, by obfuscating wallet addresses, but with the overall aim of letting users transact and exchange privacy. A parachain in the Polkadot ecosystem, Manta Network’s first major project is a privacy-preserving automated market maker (AMM) DEX called MantaSwap.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

The Manta Network is working to implement ZkSNARKs on the blockchain level. ZkSNARKs are a cryptographic technique that allows two entities to verify information with each other without having to share the underlying data related to it.

Think about it in the context of logging into a website, for example. The site verifies who you are without sharing your password, geolocation data or other information that can be used to figure out additional details about yourself that you aren’t aware you might be giving up.

According to Chu, Manta’s use of ZkSNARKS can bring privacy to transactions and user identity.

“While you are still able to monitor your own transactions, no one else can do so anymore,” he said. “By taking this and applying it in an interoperable manner (through Polkadot), we’re able to provide a plug-and-play solution for the entire ecosystem in the future.”

Right now though, Chu said the team is focusing on enhancing usability, given their goal is to be a plug-and-play solution. Additionally, they’re working to ensure transparency of both the code itself as well as the process.

“As part of the usability, we also want to focus on the security of the implementation, which takes time,” he said.

Why privacy matters

The implications for transparent transactions aren’t limited to someone knowing how much money is in an address. It can have tangible downstream effects, given that information is power.

In traditional finance, if you want to view your bank account information (including transactions and total cash), you have to prove that you are the owner of that account. No one else is allowed to view your information without your consent.

“It’s different on the blockchain – anyone who knows your wallet address can review your transactions, trace your transactions and see all of your assets,” said Chu.

Chu said that lack of privacy leads to a host of other issues that arise in scaling out blockchain use cases. Automated monitoring and scraping leads to unauthorized data collection, opening up potential opportunities for blackmail. In corporate use cases, trade secrets may be revealed by tracing transactions on chain.

On decentralized exchanges, that transparency leads to front-running opportunities, according to Chu. People are taking extra steps, which increases the friction of usage, just to make transactions more obfuscated.

Chu said the availability of privacy products are a secondary issue on DEXs, which is part of the reason he said he wants Manta Network to be plug and play.

“Future DEX projects don’t need to bring onboard their own cryptography team; they can use our development tools,” he said. “Other DeFi projects and general blockchain projects can do the same thing.”

Funding and the future

The Manta Network, which was previously a Web 3.0 Foundation Grant winner, closed a $1.1 million funding round, led by Polychain Capital, to build MantaSwap.

“Manta Network brings an experienced team to tackle the critical and growing issues regarding privacy on the blockchain,” said Ben Perszyk, partner at Polychain, in a statement. “Its unique approach to building as a Polkadot parachain enables them to offer plug-and-play privacy to a multitude of use cases and projects, starting with their own privacy-preserving DEX.”

The funding will jump-start Manta Network’s development. The team is currently finishing its prototype to deliver to the Web3 Foundation. Before the end of Q1, it will be delivering the first version of its test net. In future releases of the test net, it will introduce other assets as well as exchange functionality.","['blockchain', 'privacy', 'information', 'transaction', 'getting', 'team', 'projects', 'network', 'wallet', 'transactions', 'manta', 'defi', 'boost']","A new survey by Manta Network, a privacy-preserving decentralized finance stack built on Substrate, has shed further light on the need for privacy in the rapidly expanding DeFi space.

All of this adds up to significant upfront costs.

Mining is the “glue” that holds together many cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, by ensuring that the network comes to consensus on each and every change made in the system. Ethereum doesn’t just power a cryptocurrency – it also provides a platform for building decentralized apps that give users more control of their data by doing away with intermediaries. Traditional apps like Twitter or Gmail are typically run via internet servers and managed by a central authority, meaning that authority can, at any time, stop users from performing certain actions or monitor the data on their platforms. Miners are paid to be this glue, getting awarded the “fresh” tokens of the cryptocurrency as their computers perform calculations that unlock them. That’s why most people take up the venture in the first place.

Miners set computers loose to grind through cryptographic computations in an attempt to win ether, Ethereum’s native token. They need to try a huge number of computational problems until one unlocks a new batch of the asset.

In theory, anyone can set their computers to focus on these cryptographic puzzles as a way to win rewards. The catch is that mining on major public blockchains tends to require more and more power over time. As more people invest in more powerful hardware to mine cryptocurrency, the calculations get harder. Miners using regular computers are very, very unlikely to win.

Choosing mining hardware

Before getting started, you will need special computer hardware to dedicate full-time to mining.

There are three types of mining hardware:

CPUs

GPUs: Faster than CPUs

ASICs: Even faster and more powerful than GPUs

GPUs and ASICs boast a higher hashrate, meaning they can guess puzzle answers more quickly. At time of writing, GPUs and ASICs are now the only cost-effective option for ether miners. CPUs aren’t powerful enough anymore.

Settling up a GPU is a complex task and you can browse plenty of advice about which ones are the most profitable based on how many hashes the GPU can compute per second, power consumption and the initial expense of the card.

You probably want to set up a mining rig, a machine that might be composed of multiple GPUs and can take a week to build.Online mining profitability calculators, such as the one offered by Etherscan, give some insight into the likely amount of ether you’ll earn at a given hashrate, and whether that ether is enough – when cutting out the costs of setup and electricity – to make a profit.

Installing Ethereum software

After selecting some mining hardware, the next step is to install the mining software.

Miners need to install an Ethereum client to connect to the wider Ethereum network. An internet connection is vital for miners. Without an internet connection, the node won’t be able to do much of anything.

Programmers familiar with the command line can install Geth, software that runs an Ethereum node written in the scripting language Go, or any of the other Ethereum clients, like Parity or OpenEthereum.

Download Geth here, using the directions for your appropriate operating system (Windows, Mac OS, or Linux), unzip it, and run it.

Once installed, your node can then connect to the Ethereum network where it can then “talk” to other nodes, to catch wind of the latest transactions and blocks. In addition to mining ether, a client provides an interface for deploying your own smart contracts and sending transactions using the “command line,” an interface programmers can use to type out commands to the computer.

Install Ethereum mining software

Aspiring miners then need to install the official mining software, Ethminer.

Find the download for the appropriate version of Windows here, or GPU mining instructions for other operating systems here.

Once installed, your node will officially play a part in securing the Ethereum network. For more detailed instructions on any of the above, visit the official ethereum website.

Joining a mining pool

As a miner, you’re unlikely to be able to mine ether on your own.

That’s why miners “pool” together their computational power into “mining pools,” to improve their chances of solving the cryptographic puzzles and earning ether. Then, they split the profits proportional to how much power each miner contributed.

There are many factors involved in joining a mining pool. Each pool might not be around forever, and the computational power of each pool is constantly changing, so there are a number of factors that go into deciding which to join.

One point to keep in mind is that mining pools have different payout structures. And pools charge mining fees.

Today the most popular mining pools are:

Ethermine

F2Pool

Sparkpool

Nanopool

The distribution of Ethereum mining pools as of Jan. 7, 2021. (Etherscan.io)

Mining pools generally have a signup process on their website so miners can connect to the pool and begin mining.

Find cheap electricity

The other biggest mining cost is electricity. Many profitable miners scout for electricity discounts, either by moving to regions around the world with less expensive electricity or by tapping renewable energy sources.

Ethereum Mining FAQs

Is Ethereum mining profitable?

The answer is complex. There are many variables miners need to consider when taking the plunge into mining, such as how much ether is worth at a given time and cost of electricity, an expensive necessity for mining. The cost of electricity varies across the globe.

How could the Ethereum upgrade ‘ProgPoW’ impact mining?

ProgPoW is a proposed Ethereum upgrade that, if implemented, would hamstring the most powerful miners. The motive for doing so is to keep the network decentralized by trying to ensure that no one in the network gets too much power.

In short, miners using ASICs (hardware even more powerful for mining than GPUs – see above) are the ones that would be affected. Their ASICs, which miners likely paid a premium for, would no longer be able to be used to mine ether.

How will Ethereum 2.0 upgrade impact mining?

The upgrade Ethereum 2.0 started roll out on Dec. 1, 2020, and will be iterated upon over the next several years.

The upgrade will impact mining even more drastically than ProgPoW. Once Ethereum 2.0 is fully rolled out, the goal is to eradicate miners completely, paving the way for a more energy-efficient method of maintaining the integrity of the Ethereum blockchain.

How do I keep abreast of Ethereum events that could impact mining?

The mining world is a whirlwind of change. The tools that you pick up today might be obsolete next year. Some mining pools might fall away while others emerge.

As a miner it’s worth keeping aware of industry shifts by keeping tabs on the latest mining news as well as Ethereum protocol upgrades.","['electricity', 'mining', 'network', '101', 'upgrade', 'miners', 'need', 'pools', 'ether', 'power', 'ethereum']","Miners need to install an Ethereum client to connect to the wider Ethereum network.

['Chris Cronimund'],,https://static.coindesk.com/static/chunks/images/facebook-cd851abcf9cbd3f39aaafc2c0a54009d.png,"If you are interested in buying or selling a cryptocurrency, there are few better places to look than one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trade volume, Binance.

Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao – who earned the number-one spot on CoinDesk’s 2018 Most Influential list – Binance rose to prominence during the historic crypto market-wide bull run in 2017 by supporting a wide array of cryptocurrencies in what was, and perhaps still is, one of the fastest and most reliable trading platforms.

In fact, Binance became so popular, so quickly that CZ and Binance both became worth more than $1 billion in less than one year, officially making it one of the first companies to achieve “unicorn” status in the cryptocurrency industry.

Yet despite its reputation as a destination for crypto traders, it’s not exactly easy for users who lack a traditional trading or investment background to navigate their way around.

In this piece, we take a step-by-step look at how to use Binance and conduct a trade on the exchange.

Signing up

First thing’s first, you’ll need to create an account. Anyone is able to sign up since Binance does not require customer information, but by doing so “you acknowledge and declare that you are not on any trade or economic sanctions lists” as per its Terms of Use.

This includes citizens of the member countries in the UN Security Council Sanctions list, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC), among other groups.

The terms also state each user must be at least 18 years of age. Binance reserves the right to cancel or freeze any account If the terms are disobeyed.

If the restrictions do not apply to you, to sign up simply navigate to the homepage and click register.

You will then be asked to enter a minimal amount of personal information such as your email address, password, and a referral ID if you have one.

As per Binance’s referral system, you will receive 50 percent of your referrals trading fees.

After you fill in the required fields, click “Register” and complete the captcha, a confirmation link will be sent to your email address.

Once the link is clicked, your Binance account is ready to be used.

Deposit Funds

Now that your account is activated, but before exploring the rest of the exchange, you’ll need to add funds to your account if you wish to buy or sell any cryptocurrencies.

Pay with credit card

Binance has a feature that allows users to purchase certain cryptocurrencies directly with their Visa or Mastercard credit card. If you are a qualified candidate, navigate to the “Funds” tab and select “Buy With Credit Card.”

You will then be required to enter the purchase amount of the desired cryptocurrency and whether you will be paying with the US dollar or euro. Cryptocurrency purchases by credit card are limited to BTC, ETH, and LTC at this time.

There is a minimum processing fee of $10 or 3.5 percent of the total order – whichever is more expensive. After completing this step, you will need to confirm your billing information, email address as well as your identity.

A valid government issued form of ID is required to be submitted to confirm your identity.

Once all of the required steps have been completed, the newly purchased cryptocurrency should reach your Binance wallet within 10-30 minutes.

Deposit from wallet

You can also make a deposit by sending funds from a separate cryptocurrency wallet into your Binance account.

In order to do this, navigate to the “Funds” tab once again and click “Balances.”

On this page, you will see all of the cryptocurrencies available for trading on Binance. To deposit the corresponding crypto into any of these, simply click the “Deposit” button next to the crypto asset of your choice.

Next, either scan the QR code from your cryptocurrency wallet or paste in the address and then send.

Once that’s complete, wait for the transaction to process and you’ll be ready for trading.

Placing a trade

Let’s go back to the home page now that your funds are ready to be used.

Here, you will again see all the cryptocurrencies that are tradable on Binance and their respective markets.

For this example, let’s say you previously deposited 0.0024 BTC (~$10) into your account and now wish to trade it for NEO.

First, you’ll need to find the right NEO market.

Since you want to spend BTC in order to get NEO, click the “BTC Markets” tab and then type NEO into the search bar.

Click the appropriate row and the page where trading takes place will open.

Trading module

This page may look intimidating, but you can easily get the hang of it with a bit of practice.

Plus, most cryptocurrency exchanges have a similar trading interface so what you remember here, in all likelihood, will be relevant elsewhere.

The left section of the screen is known as an order book.

Here, you will see all active buy and sell limit orders. A limit order is simply an order that will only be placed at the user’s desired price, given there are buyers or sellers interested at that level.

If you would like to learn the “in’s and out’s” of an order book, check out our comprehensive guide, but for now all you need to know is that the top of the order book (red) is where the limit sell orders wait to be filled and the bottom section (green) is where the limit buy orders wait to be filled.

The right side of the page is more simple – the above section shows the other cryptocurrencies that can be traded and the lower section shows the public trade history of the market currently being viewed.

Trade example: Buying NEO

The center of the page is where the real magic happens.

Here lays a chart feature that shows real-time price action and technical analysis indicators. Just below the chart is where you will actually execute the trade, so let’s buy some NEO.

If certainty of execution is your priority, select market order. If you are interested in only buying at a specific price level, select either limit or stop-limit order.

For the purposes of this example, let’s place a market order, which will be placed immediately at current market prices.

Now, just enter the amount of BTC desired to be spent and how much NEO you want to purchase. Binance has a useful shortcut for entering the purchase amount and it is based on a percentage of your bitcoin balance (or any other appropriate trading pair).

Let’s spend 50 percent of the BTC balance so there is some left over, perhaps for another trade.

The last step is to click the big green button “Buy NEO.” Since this is a market order, the trade for 0.58 NEO should have completed instantly, but that is most likely not the case if you selected limit or stop-limit order.

To check on the status of your order, look towards the bottom of the page where it says “Open order.” As the title would suggest, if your order has not yet executed, in other words, is still “open,” it will appear in this box until it has either been canceled or filled.

When it has been filled, it will show up in the lower box highlighting your 24-hour order history, just as how this order has below.

In order to sell, simply follow this same process but execute a market or limit sell order.

Withdrawing funds

While Binance does have a decentralized exchange in the works, the existing platform is centralized and susceptible to hacks like many other websites, so it’s recommended funds are only held on the exchange for as long as necessary.

In order to withdraw, navigate back to the “Balances” page. If you would like to see only the cryptocurrencies you have a substantial balance in, check the “hide” box.

Now select the withdrawal button in the NEO row and have your destination address or QR code handy. Paste the address and select how much you want to withdraw.

Last but not least, click submit and wait for the transaction to complete.

Binance Launchpad

The Binance Launchpad is a token launch platform exclusive to Binance and plans to offer token sales for new projects.

Binance handpicks which tokens to launch based on a number of factors including project maturity, scalability and adoption readiness, team quality and the ability of the project to benefit the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

To ensure the sales are being conducted in compliance with regulatory regimes around the world, each user must verify his or her Binance account.

Completed token sales, as well as those scheduled for a future date, can be seen on the home page of the Binance Launchpad. It’s worth noting that the token sales operate on a “first come, first serve” basis and usually sell out in just minutes, so be sure to do your due diligence.

If you successfully participate in a Launchpad token sale, the tokens will be automatically credited to your Binance account.

Security

Like most modern cryptocurrency exchanges, two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled on Binance and is highly recommended to be set up in order to add an extra layer of protection to your account.

In order to do so, navigate to your account summary by clicking the user avatar in the top right of the home page.

Once directed to your account page, a prompt will likely appear suggesting you to enable 2FA, which happens to automatically pops up when a new user accesses this page.

Binance allows two methods for enabling 2FA, via SMS or Google Authenticator.

With the SMS version, simply enter your mobile phone number and the verification code sent to the corresponding phone and you will be all set.

If Google Authenticator is your 2FA of choice, download the mobile application, open it and scan the QR code provided by Binance. Next, you will be asked to write down a 16-word recovery phrase to be used as a backup in case you lose access to this google authentication.

Lastly, you will be prompted to enter your account’s login password and the authenticator code found in the Google Authenticator mobile app. Once complete, this form of 2FA security will be complete.

Pros and Cons

Pros

If you're constantly on the go, Binance’s mobile application may be perfect for you. It's compatible with iOS, Android, as well as Mac and PC operating systems so just about anyone can place a trade or monitor their account from virtually anywhere.

Binance offers a large selection of tradeable cryptocurrency markets. As of May 1, 2019, 467 different markets are supported on the exchange.

Binance has it own native exchange token, BNB, which can be used to supplement trading fees and boost the overall liquidity on Binance.

Binance was a pioneer of the Initial Exchange Offerings, and It’s Launchpad facilitates sales once a month for those who are interested in being early holders of new tokens.

Higher trading volume that most other cryptocurrency exchanges.

Cons

If following government regulations like that of the US is important to you, then you may want to try out exchanges such As Coinbase or Gemini, because at this point Binance is still an unregulated exchange.

Many of Binance’s markets, specifically those of the lesser known altcoins, offer low liquidity which can make trading large altcoin positions difficult.

Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao – who earned the number-one spot on CoinDesk’s 2018 Most Influential list – Binance rose to prominence during the historic crypto market-wide bull run in 2017 by supporting a wide array of cryptocurrencies in what was, and perhaps still is, one of the fastest and most reliable trading platforms.

In fact, Binance became so popular, so quickly that CZ and Binance both became worth more than $1 billion in less than one year, officially making it one of the first companies to achieve “unicorn” status in the cryptocurrency industry.

Yet despite its reputation as a destination for crypto traders, it’s not exactly easy for users who lack a traditional trading or investment background to navigate their way around.

In this piece, we take a step-by-step look at how to use Binance and conduct a trade on the exchange.

Signing up

First thing’s first, you’ll need to create an account. Anyone is able to sign up since Binance does not require customer information, but by doing so “you acknowledge and declare that you are not on any trade or economic sanctions lists” as per its Terms of Use.

This includes citizens of the member countries in the UN Security Council Sanctions list, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC), among other groups.

The terms also state each user must be at least 18 years of age. Binance reserves the right to cancel or freeze any account If the terms are disobeyed.

If the restrictions do not apply to you, to sign up simply navigate to the homepage and click register.

You will then be asked to enter a minimal amount of personal information such as your email address, password, and a referral ID if you have one.

As per Binance’s referral system, you will receive 50 percent of your referrals trading fees.

After you fill in the required fields, click “Register” and complete the captcha, a confirmation link will be sent to your email address.

Once the link is clicked, your Binance account is ready to be used.

Deposit Funds

Now that your account is activated, but before exploring the rest of the exchange, you’ll need to add funds to your account if you wish to buy or sell any cryptocurrencies.

Pay with credit card

Binance has a feature that allows users to purchase certain cryptocurrencies directly with their Visa or Mastercard credit card. If you are a qualified candidate, navigate to the “Funds” tab and select “Buy With Credit Card.”

You will then be required to enter the purchase amount of the desired cryptocurrency and whether you will be paying with the US dollar or euro. Cryptocurrency purchases by credit card are limited to BTC, ETH, and LTC at this time.

There is a minimum processing fee of $10 or 3.5 percent of the total order – whichever is more expensive. After completing this step, you will need to confirm your billing information, email address as well as your identity.

A valid government issued form of ID is required to be submitted to confirm your identity.

Once all of the required steps have been completed, the newly purchased cryptocurrency should reach your Binance wallet within 10-30 minutes.

Deposit from wallet

You can also make a deposit by sending funds from a separate cryptocurrency wallet into your Binance account.

In order to do this, navigate to the “Funds” tab once again and click “Balances.”

On this page, you will see all of the cryptocurrencies available for trading on Binance. To deposit the corresponding crypto into any of these, simply click the “Deposit” button next to the crypto asset of your choice.

Next, either scan the QR code from your cryptocurrency wallet or paste in the address and then send.

Once that’s complete, wait for the transaction to process and you’ll be ready for trading.

Placing a trade

Let’s go back to the home page now that your funds are ready to be used.

Here, you will again see all the cryptocurrencies that are tradable on Binance and their respective markets.

For this example, let’s say you previously deposited 0.0024 BTC (~$10) into your account and now wish to trade it for NEO.

First, you’ll need to find the right NEO market.

Since you want to spend BTC in order to get NEO, click the “BTC Markets” tab and then type NEO into the search bar.

Click the appropriate row and the page where trading takes place will open.

Trading module

This page may look intimidating, but you can easily get the hang of it with a bit of practice.

Plus, most cryptocurrency exchanges have a similar trading interface so what you remember here, in all likelihood, will be relevant elsewhere.

The left section of the screen is known as an order book.

Here, you will see all active buy and sell limit orders. A limit order is simply an order that will only be placed at the user’s desired price, given there are buyers or sellers interested at that level.

If you would like to learn the “in’s and out’s” of an order book, check out our comprehensive guide, but for now all you need to know is that the top of the order book (red) is where the limit sell orders wait to be filled and the bottom section (green) is where the limit buy orders wait to be filled.

The right side of the page is more simple – the above section shows the other cryptocurrencies that can be traded and the lower section shows the public trade history of the market currently being viewed.

Trade example: Buying NEO

The center of the page is where the real magic happens.

Here lays a chart feature that shows real-time price action and technical analysis indicators. Just below the chart is where you will actually execute the trade, so let’s buy some NEO.

If certainty of execution is your priority, select market order. If you are interested in only buying at a specific price level, select either limit or stop-limit order.

For the purposes of this example, let’s place a market order, which will be placed immediately at current market prices.

Now, just enter the amount of BTC desired to be spent and how much NEO you want to purchase. Binance has a useful shortcut for entering the purchase amount and it is based on a percentage of your bitcoin balance (or any other appropriate trading pair).

Let’s spend 50 percent of the BTC balance so there is some left over, perhaps for another trade.

The last step is to click the big green button “Buy NEO.” Since this is a market order, the trade for 0.58 NEO should have completed instantly, but that is most likely not the case if you selected limit or stop-limit order.

To check on the status of your order, look towards the bottom of the page where it says “Open order.” As the title would suggest, if your order has not yet executed, in other words, is still “open,” it will appear in this box until it has either been canceled or filled.

When it has been filled, it will show up in the lower box highlighting your 24-hour order history, just as how this order has below.

In order to sell, simply follow this same process but execute a market or limit sell order.

Withdrawing funds

While Binance does have a decentralized exchange in the works, the existing platform is centralized and susceptible to hacks like many other websites, so it’s recommended funds are only held on the exchange for as long as necessary.

In order to withdraw, navigate back to the “Balances” page. If you would like to see only the cryptocurrencies you have a substantial balance in, check the “hide” box.

Now select the withdrawal button in the NEO row and have your destination address or QR code handy. Paste the address and select how much you want to withdraw.

Last but not least, click submit and wait for the transaction to complete.

Binance Launchpad

The Binance Launchpad is a token launch platform exclusive to Binance and plans to offer token sales for new projects.

Binance handpicks which tokens to launch based on a number of factors including project maturity, scalability and adoption readiness, team quality and the ability of the project to benefit the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

To ensure the sales are being conducted in compliance with regulatory regimes around the world, each user must verify his or her Binance account.

Completed token sales, as well as those scheduled for a future date, can be seen on the home page of the Binance Launchpad. It’s worth noting that the token sales operate on a “first come, first serve” basis and usually sell out in just minutes, so be sure to do your due diligence.

If you successfully participate in a Launchpad token sale, the tokens will be automatically credited to your Binance account.

Security

Like most modern cryptocurrency exchanges, two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled on Binance and is highly recommended to be set up in order to add an extra layer of protection to your account.

In order to do so, navigate to your account summary by clicking the user avatar in the top right of the home page.

Once directed to your account page, a prompt will likely appear suggesting you to enable 2FA, which happens to automatically pops up when a new user accesses this page.

Binance allows two methods for enabling 2FA, via SMS or Google Authenticator.

With the SMS version, simply enter your mobile phone number and the verification code sent to the corresponding phone and you will be all set.

If Google Authenticator is your 2FA of choice, download the mobile application, open it and scan the QR code provided by Binance. Next, you will be asked to write down a 16-word recovery phrase to be used as a backup in case you lose access to this google authentication.

Lastly, you will be prompted to enter your account’s login password and the authenticator code found in the Google Authenticator mobile app. Once complete, this form of 2FA security will be complete.

Pros and Cons

Pros

If you're constantly on the go, Binance’s mobile application may be perfect for you. It's compatible with iOS, Android, as well as Mac and PC operating systems so just about anyone can place a trade or monitor their account from virtually anywhere.

Binance offers a large selection of tradeable cryptocurrency markets. As of May 1, 2019, 467 different markets are supported on the exchange.

Binance has it own native exchange token, BNB, which can be used to supplement trading fees and boost the overall liquidity on Binance.

Binance was a pioneer of the Initial Exchange Offerings, and It’s Launchpad facilitates sales once a month for those who are interested in being early holders of new tokens.

Higher trading volume that most other cryptocurrency exchanges.

Cons

If following government regulations like that of the US is important to you, then you may want to try out exchanges such As Coinbase or Gemini, because at this point Binance is still an unregulated exchange.

Many of Binance’s markets, specifically those of the lesser known altcoins, offer low liquidity which can make trading large altcoin positions difficult.

['Chris Cronimund'],,https://static.coindesk.com/static/chunks/images/facebook-cd851abcf9cbd3f39aaafc2c0a54009d.png,"If you are interested in buying or selling a cryptocurrency, there are few better places to look than one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trade volume, Binance.

Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao – who earned the number-one spot on CoinDesk’s 2018 Most Influential list – Binance rose to prominence during the historic crypto market-wide bull run in 2017 by supporting a wide array of cryptocurrencies in what was, and perhaps still is, one of the fastest and most reliable trading platforms.

In fact, Binance became so popular, so quickly that CZ and Binance both became worth more than $1 billion in less than one year, officially making it one of the first companies to achieve “unicorn” status in the cryptocurrency industry.

Yet despite its reputation as a destination for crypto traders, it’s not exactly easy for users who lack a traditional trading or investment background to navigate their way around.

In this piece, we take a step-by-step look at how to use Binance and conduct a trade on the exchange.

Signing up

First thing’s first, you’ll need to create an account. Anyone is able to sign up since Binance does not require customer information, but by doing so “you acknowledge and declare that you are not on any trade or economic sanctions lists” as per its Terms of Use.

This includes citizens of the member countries in the UN Security Council Sanctions list, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC), among other groups.

The terms also state each user must be at least 18 years of age. Binance reserves the right to cancel or freeze any account If the terms are disobeyed.

If the restrictions do not apply to you, to sign up simply navigate to the homepage and click register.

You will then be asked to enter a minimal amount of personal information such as your email address, password, and a referral ID if you have one.

As per Binance’s referral system, you will receive 50 percent of your referrals trading fees.

After you fill in the required fields, click “Register” and complete the captcha, a confirmation link will be sent to your email address.

Once the link is clicked, your Binance account is ready to be used.

Deposit Funds

Now that your account is activated, but before exploring the rest of the exchange, you’ll need to add funds to your account if you wish to buy or sell any cryptocurrencies.

Pay with credit card

Binance has a feature that allows users to purchase certain cryptocurrencies directly with their Visa or Mastercard credit card. If you are a qualified candidate, navigate to the “Funds” tab and select “Buy With Credit Card.”

You will then be required to enter the purchase amount of the desired cryptocurrency and whether you will be paying with the US dollar or euro. Cryptocurrency purchases by credit card are limited to BTC, ETH, and LTC at this time.

There is a minimum processing fee of $10 or 3.5 percent of the total order – whichever is more expensive. After completing this step, you will need to confirm your billing information, email address as well as your identity.

A valid government issued form of ID is required to be submitted to confirm your identity.

Once all of the required steps have been completed, the newly purchased cryptocurrency should reach your Binance wallet within 10-30 minutes.

Deposit from wallet

You can also make a deposit by sending funds from a separate cryptocurrency wallet into your Binance account.

In order to do this, navigate to the “Funds” tab once again and click “Balances.”

On this page, you will see all of the cryptocurrencies available for trading on Binance. To deposit the corresponding crypto into any of these, simply click the “Deposit” button next to the crypto asset of your choice.

Next, either scan the QR code from your cryptocurrency wallet or paste in the address and then send.

Once that’s complete, wait for the transaction to process and you’ll be ready for trading.

Placing a trade

Let’s go back to the home page now that your funds are ready to be used.

Here, you will again see all the cryptocurrencies that are tradable on Binance and their respective markets.

For this example, let’s say you previously deposited 0.0024 BTC (~$10) into your account and now wish to trade it for NEO.

First, you’ll need to find the right NEO market.

Since you want to spend BTC in order to get NEO, click the “BTC Markets” tab and then type NEO into the search bar.

Click the appropriate row and the page where trading takes place will open.

Trading module

This page may look intimidating, but you can easily get the hang of it with a bit of practice.

Plus, most cryptocurrency exchanges have a similar trading interface so what you remember here, in all likelihood, will be relevant elsewhere.

The left section of the screen is known as an order book.

Here, you will see all active buy and sell limit orders. A limit order is simply an order that will only be placed at the user’s desired price, given there are buyers or sellers interested at that level.

If you would like to learn the “in’s and out’s” of an order book, check out our comprehensive guide, but for now all you need to know is that the top of the order book (red) is where the limit sell orders wait to be filled and the bottom section (green) is where the limit buy orders wait to be filled.

The right side of the page is more simple – the above section shows the other cryptocurrencies that can be traded and the lower section shows the public trade history of the market currently being viewed.

Trade example: Buying NEO

The center of the page is where the real magic happens.

Here lays a chart feature that shows real-time price action and technical analysis indicators. Just below the chart is where you will actually execute the trade, so let’s buy some NEO.

If certainty of execution is your priority, select market order. If you are interested in only buying at a specific price level, select either limit or stop-limit order.

For the purposes of this example, let’s place a market order, which will be placed immediately at current market prices.

Now, just enter the amount of BTC desired to be spent and how much NEO you want to purchase. Binance has a useful shortcut for entering the purchase amount and it is based on a percentage of your bitcoin balance (or any other appropriate trading pair).

Let’s spend 50 percent of the BTC balance so there is some left over, perhaps for another trade.

The last step is to click the big green button “Buy NEO.” Since this is a market order, the trade for 0.58 NEO should have completed instantly, but that is most likely not the case if you selected limit or stop-limit order.

To check on the status of your order, look towards the bottom of the page where it says “Open order.” As the title would suggest, if your order has not yet executed, in other words, is still “open,” it will appear in this box until it has either been canceled or filled.

When it has been filled, it will show up in the lower box highlighting your 24-hour order history, just as how this order has below.

In order to sell, simply follow this same process but execute a market or limit sell order.

Withdrawing funds

While Binance does have a decentralized exchange in the works, the existing platform is centralized and susceptible to hacks like many other websites, so it’s recommended funds are only held on the exchange for as long as necessary.

In order to withdraw, navigate back to the “Balances” page. If you would like to see only the cryptocurrencies you have a substantial balance in, check the “hide” box.

Now select the withdrawal button in the NEO row and have your destination address or QR code handy. Paste the address and select how much you want to withdraw.

Last but not least, click submit and wait for the transaction to complete.

Binance Launchpad

The Binance Launchpad is a token launch platform exclusive to Binance and plans to offer token sales for new projects.

Binance handpicks which tokens to launch based on a number of factors including project maturity, scalability and adoption readiness, team quality and the ability of the project to benefit the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

To ensure the sales are being conducted in compliance with regulatory regimes around the world, each user must verify his or her Binance account.

Completed token sales, as well as those scheduled for a future date, can be seen on the home page of the Binance Launchpad. It’s worth noting that the token sales operate on a “first come, first serve” basis and usually sell out in just minutes, so be sure to do your due diligence.

If you successfully participate in a Launchpad token sale, the tokens will be automatically credited to your Binance account.

Security

Like most modern cryptocurrency exchanges, two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled on Binance and is highly recommended to be set up in order to add an extra layer of protection to your account.

In order to do so, navigate to your account summary by clicking the user avatar in the top right of the home page.

Once directed to your account page, a prompt will likely appear suggesting you to enable 2FA, which happens to automatically pops up when a new user accesses this page.

Binance allows two methods for enabling 2FA, via SMS or Google Authenticator.

With the SMS version, simply enter your mobile phone number and the verification code sent to the corresponding phone and you will be all set.

If Google Authenticator is your 2FA of choice, download the mobile application, open it and scan the QR code provided by Binance. Next, you will be asked to write down a 16-word recovery phrase to be used as a backup in case you lose access to this google authentication.

Lastly, you will be prompted to enter your account’s login password and the authenticator code found in the Google Authenticator mobile app. Once complete, this form of 2FA security will be complete.

According to an excerpt from the firm’s upcoming “2021 Crypto Crime Report,” published Monday, online marketplaces providing illegal goods like drugs and fake IDs received a record-setting amount of cryptocurrency last year, equivalent to $1.7 billion. Russia, the U.S., Ukraine and China were the main areas of global money traffic to such platforms.

Darknet marketplaces receive most of their money through peer-to-peer crypto marketplaces and centralized exchanges, Chainalysis wrote. However, in 2020, the use of centralized exchanges increased, as did mixing services, which allow to obfuscate the participants in a cryptocurrency transaction.

Drug deal distribution

The report lists 10 countries where people are most actively interacting with dark markets: Russia, the U.S., Ukraine, China, the U.K., Venezuela, Vietnam, Turkey, India and Germany. Together, these nations were the source of $538 million to illicit markets during 2020 while people there received $403 million, Chainalysis said.

Russians sent around $169 million to the various darknet marketplaces, and received $119 million from such sites. Americans were second, with $115 million sent and $64 million received. In third place, Ukrainians sent $47 million and received $52 million.

“Generally speaking, drugs are grown or manufactured in Latin America and Asia and consumed in North America and Northern & Western Europe,” the report reads. “Darknet vendors and administrators typically launder funds through cryptocurrency services – often over-the-counter (OTC) brokers – in China or Eastern Europe. We can see some of this activity in the blockchain data associated with darknet market transactions.”

Dominant player

The biggest marketplace in the field by far is Hydra, a Russian-language drug marketplace that pocketed 75% of the entire global dark market revenue, Chainalysis said. Hydra was mostly responsible for the rapid growth in the global dark market revenue over the last year, while the income of other marketplaces didn’t change significantly between 2019 and 2020.

Hydra delivers drugs to buyers via “drops,” in which a delivery person hides the purchase close to a buyer and shares the geolocation of the package so it can be collected. In December 2019, Hydra announced it wanted to expand to other regions of the world and would hold a $146 million token sale. This was later put on hold due to the global coronavirus pandemic.

According to the data from Bitfury’s data firm Crystal Blockchain, currently, Hydra’s bitcoin addresses hold more than 521 BTC, worth over $18 million. Since 2011, Hydra has sent and received more than 439,000 BTC ($15.2 billion).

Data limitations

Chainalysis has been researching the various aspects of geography of cryptocurrency use for several years, although the firm admits locating such activity on the globe is a tricky task and such research has its limitations.

To see where in the world crypto markets are most active, Chainalysis looks into such data as web traffic on the particular services via SimilarWeb, time zones in which transactions take place, fiat currencies involved, languages and the location of the headquarters of the services, the firm’s head of research, Kim Grauer, told CoinDesk for a previous report on cryptocurrency adoption around the globe.","['dark', 'dominate', 'sent', 'russia', 'marketplaces', 'services', 'chainalysis', 'received', 'cryptocurrency', 'market', 'report', 'million', 'traffic', 'global', 'hydra']","People in Russia and the U.S. were the source of over $284 million to illicit online marketplaces in 2020, blockchain research firm Chainalysis said in its latest report.

In traditional markets, European and Asian shares rose and U.S. stock futures pointed toward a higher open amid renewed optimism for economic stimulus and the distribution of coronavirus vaccines. GameStop shares lost nearly a third of their value on Monday following last week’s 400% short squeeze.

Silver, whose price had shot up to an eight-year high after a series of posts on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum calling for a “short squeeze,” tumbled as some commenters pushed back against the narrative; precious-metals analysts for the lenders HSBC and Commerzbank warned the rally would be hard to sustain. Gold weakened 0.6% to $1,849 an ounce.

Market Moves

With the coronavirus vaccine distribution well underway, Wall Street analysts are sketching out what the economy might look like as 2021 unfolds and social-distancing measures recede.

The short answer is that activity is set to heat up, which could also provide the first real test of the hidden inflationary pressures that might have built up over the past year. Whatever happens will likely prove crucial for the bitcoin market because the cryptocurrency has become one of the most popular ways for big investors to bet on the likelihood of rising prices or dollar debasement.

The U.S. Congressional Budget Office projected on Monday that gross domestic product will expand by 3.7% this year, after a 2.5% contraction in 2020. But Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. lender, is even more optimistic, recently boosting its forecast for this year’s growth to 6%, from 4.5% at the start of the year.

A key question for the inflation watchers, of course, is just how much stimulus money will be pumped into the economy by the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve.

President Joe Biden has proposed a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill, but a group of senators from the opposition Republican party on Monday released details of a $618 billion proposal they argue is more appropriate. Bank of America’s analysts assume the package will end up around $1 trillion.

Why it matters is that as Americans start to get out and about, a surge in consumer spending looks likely. The Bank of America analysts estimate there’s already some $1.6 trillion of excess savings that might start to trickle into the economy.

“The jolt from stimulus, the support of excess savings and the green light from lower virus cases should unleash pent-up consumer spending,” the Bank of America economists wrote. “Stronger growth means a lower unemployment rate and greater inflation pressure.”

That outlook raises the question of how the Fed might respond, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell stating last week that it’s “too early to be talking about dates“ for tapering the central bank’s $120-billion-a-month of bond purchases – funded via printing more money – that are currently ongoing to provide stimulus to financial markets.

By the middle of this year, if the economy is recovering quickly Powell and his colleagues might find it harder to characterize any talk of tapering as still too soon. Because these are typically well-telegraphed affairs, the actual tapering might start six to seven months after that. Call it early 2022.

“We believe the Fed will have difficulty justifying persistently large asset purchases in the face of a sustainable decrease in [COVID-19] cases, economic overheating, and frothy asset prices,” according to Bank of America.

On the other hand, the Fed might flinch.

“We can envision a scenario whereby the Fed signals an intention to taper/starts tapering, markets react negatively, and the Fed finds that they need to continue purchasing or extend the duration of their purchases in order to preserve market functioning,” according to Bank of America.

It’s that latter scenario – or even just the prospect of it – that might drive bitcoin prices a lot higher. Based on the reluctance of central bankers to withdraw stimulus, not to mention the market lurches late last year when a new U.S. stimulus bill seemed in doubt, the scenario isn’t all that implausible.

Bitcoin’s ongoing range play between $30,000 and $40,000 could end with a bullish breakout as demand from investors continues to outstrip new supplies of the cryptocurrency.

In 2021 so far, around 26,000 new bitcoins have been produced by miners on the Bitcoin blockchain, data provider Glassnode said in a weekly report. Yet, in the same period, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has acquired over 40,000 BTC. (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.)

In another bullish indicator, the number of coins held on exchange addresses continues to slide, interpreted as a sign of waning interest from sellers. The balance of bitcoin held across all exchanges fell to a 2.5-year low of 2,349,040 on Monday, according to Glassnode.

On the bearish side, a stronger dollar could play spoilsport to any push higher. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback’s value against major currencies, is looking north, with price charts showing a major bullish pattern known an “inverse head-and-shoulders breakout.”

“If a bullish trend develops from DXY’s latest breakout, it could be a problem for bitcoin,” trader and analyst Alex Kruger told CoinDesk.

The spillover to digital markets from the past week’s GameStop saga has taken on a new form: Soaring demand for digital tokens associated with cryptocurrency exchanges and the arcane but fast-growing arena of decentralized finance, known as DeFi, which could provide an alternative to Wall Street and traditional trading platforms.

“It seems investors are looking for the next trade to cycle through,” Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the cryptocurrency exchange firm EQUOS, wrote Tuesday in a note to clients.

The exchange Binance’s in-house BNB token hit a new all-time high on Monday, just days after rival FTX’s FTT token logged a new record, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reported.

Prices have also hit new highs for tokens from decentralized exchanges, which are essentially just automated, blockchain-based software protocols that can be used to trade digital assets. Uniswap’s UNI and SushiSwap’s SUSHI both saw big price jumps – a dynamic that might reflect retail investors’ growing concerns with centralized trading platforms amid widespread anger over Robinhood’s trading suspensions last week. Trading volumes on the decentralized exchanges,, hit a record above $50 billion in January, CoinDesk’s Zack Voell reported.

Ether, the native blockchain of the Ethereum blockchain, where much of the DeFi development is taking place, has pushed back toward a record high above $1,400.

“Decentralized trading, decentralized lending, decentralized insurance, decentralized everything starts to make a lot more sense in light of what is happening today in the traditional financial system,” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of the cryptocurrency-focused Arca Funds, wrote Monday in his weekly newsletter.

What's Hot

“It’s pretty obvious that the WSB traders are applying the same principles of the digital/CryptoAsset world to the stock market and they are loving the fact that the old schoolers are hating it,” billionaire Mark Cuban writes in a blog post. (CoinDesk)

Coinbase has reportedly tapped Nasdaq for its planned direct listing, according to The Block. Existing Coinbase investors have already been trading shares through Nasdaq’s Private Market platform, where the company has notched an implied valuation of $50 billion.

Winklevosses’ Gemini crypto exchange inks partnership with crypto lender Genesis to give customers option to earn up to 7.4% annual interest on holdings, CoinDesk’s Nathan DiCamillo reported. The new offering aims to lure away customers turned off by “anemic” interest rates from traditional banks, Gemini COO Noah Perlman said. According to DiCamillo, the annual yield is consistent with what’s typically seen among centralized crypto lenders but pales in comparison to yield farming interest rates in decentralized finance (DeFi), which are much higher but more erratic. (Genesis is another CoinDesk sister company.)

The latest on the economy and traditional finance

Robinhood has raised $3.4 billion from investors over the past several days, CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson reported. The online trading platform’s backers are apparently looking past the blowback from Robinhood’s trading suspensions amid the peak of the runup in prices for GameStop, AMC and other “meme stocks.” CFO Jason Warnick said the cash infusion will help Robinhood “scale to meet the incredible growth we’ve seen and demand for our platform.” Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev is expected to testify before the U.S. House of Representatives’ financial-services committee on Feb. 18, CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair reported.

Even before the pandemic hit, global debt was at a far higher level than before the financial crisis of 2008, according to the International Monetary Fund. The figure reached $197 trillion at the end of 2019, for a debt-to-GDP ratio of 226%, according to an International Monetary Fund blog post on Monday. That compares with a ratio of 193% in 2007. But because of unusually accommodative monetary policies (i.e., interest rates set at close to zero or even negative levels), the average debt expense as a share of revenue was 0.3 percentage points lower in 2019, according to the IMF. With U.S. government debt alone rising by about $4 trillion to about $27 trillion, the year-end 2020 numbers are likely to look a lot uglier.

In fact, I’m gobsmacked at how little there is,” said Cobalt Chairman Adrian Patten. “Also, I’ve noticed that in the crypto world everyone concentrates on the coin, the crypto bit. They forget the dollar. Whether that’s from a risk management perspective, management of collateral or settlement, that’s always the thing that holds them back.”

Specifically, the partnership involves integrating METACO’s institutional operating system for digital assets, SILO, with Cobalt’s interoperable FX and digital assets platform to offer a fully integrated end-to-end SaaS solution for the storage, limit allocation and intraday settlement of digital assets, per a press release.

“There’s a lot of friction in the market still,” said Seamus Donoghue, VP of sales and business development at METACO. “When you trade on exchanges or with counterparts in general, you have to pre-fund those positions. That’s capital intensive. There’s a counterparty risk there as well, and it’s just not a very efficient market.”

BBVA, StanChart and more

Between them the two firms have a hand in most of the major crypto banking plays happening in Europe right now. METACO is working on crypto custody with Standard Chartered, BBVA, DBS Bank and Gazprombank Switzerland. Cobalt is also involved with Standard Chartered and has other projects in the pipeline involving the likes of ErisX and LMAX Digital.

Cobalt’s Patten pointed out that banks and many regulated buy-side firms need certain processes and ways of doing things. “You can’t go settling a transaction on the back of emails. Which is what happens,” he said.

But it’s not just institutions looking for better digital asset trading infrastructure. Many of the largest crypto exchanges are in talks with the firms too, Patten said.

“Over 75% of our pipeline is crypto firms looking to upgrade their processes,” Patten said. “They’re having massive increases of volume and volatility, and they realize you can’t carry on doing it in this way. We’re going to be signing a bunch of these firms up in the first quarter.”","['metaco', 'digital', 'exchanges', 'banks', 'crypto', 'settlement', 'thats', 'upgrade', 'infrastructure', 'cobalt', 'patten', 'firms', 'assets', 'trading']","Announced Tuesday, METACO and Cobalt are launching a software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering that covers the full gamut of institutional trading requirements for digital assets.

“We have a lot of customers who look at the interest rate in traditional finance, which is pretty anemic,” said Noah Perlman, Gemini’s chief operating officer. The company hopes to give customers a reason to keep their crypto on the Gemini platform. The product is in line with other traditional-looking crypto products such as the Gemini credit card launched earlier this year.

The APY is consistent with what’s typically seen among centralized crypto lenders, but pales in comparison to yield farming interest rates in decentralized finance (DeFi), which are much higher but more erratic. (Genesis is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)

The product is offered in all 50 states, including New York where Gemini has its trust license. Users can get yield on any cryptocurrency available on the Gemini platform now and on Gemini’s GUSD stablecoin at some point in the future. The product is open to active Gemini customers currently and will be rolled out to all Gemini customers later this month.

Gemini collects part of the spread between interest paid on the crypto and interest Genesis charges on its loans to institutions. As part of the partnership, Gemini reviewed Genesis’ financial statements and verified that the lender’s loans are overcollateralized, said Yusuf Hussain, Gemini’s head of risk.

Last Thursday, Robinhood limited the ability of traders to buy GameStop and other stocks targeted by Reddit group WallStreetBets, which worked to cause financial harm to large hedge funds by causing a short squeeze on the hedge funds betting against the stocks.

Tenev said his platform acted to protect itself and customers during a tumultuous trading period where demand outstripped its ability to facilitate obligatory deposits to clearinghouses.

Melvin Capital, the $8 billion hedge fund that didn’t find GameStop (GME) funny, lost 53% of its portfolio in January ($7 billion) trying to short against the rallying cries of the Reddit Capitalist Union. Founder Gabe Plotkin also faces the embarrassment of having to get bailed out by his old boss.

Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter.

Speaking of, Steven A Cohen, New York Mets baseball team owner and former name-on-the-door of SAC Capital (known most recently for its insider trading fine of $1.8 billion), put $2.8 billion of capital into Melvin’s fund.

Ken Griffin, owner of the Citadel hedge fund (an investor in Melvin), and Citadel Securities (a massive market maker and buyer-of-order-flow for Robinhood), is seeing capital losses in the former and Washington, D.C., cries for scrutiny into market structure in regards to the latter.

Robinhood itself – which, for goodness sake, is not Wall Street but as Silicon Valley as it possibly gets – raised $1 billion immediately to protect itself from class-action lawsuits, DTCC capital calls and a now-rapidly closing IPO window. That means Yuri Milner of DST Global chipping in yet again.

That’s at least four people that have had a very bad, no good day.

The Reddit WallStreetBets army has eight million members. Robinhood has 13 million users. These are the opposing forces. They are, loosely speaking, having a pretty good day.

This isn’t about how much money you have. This is about a mindset and a framing of the world. It’s about who you are and who you are not.

But other billionaires are having way more fun. The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, is raising the crypto rallying flag and ex-Facebook billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya is trading along with Reddit for quick profits, decentralized hedge fund and all. This isn’t about how much money you have. This is about a mindset and a framing of the world. It’s about who you are and who you are not. And it’s about what you did and did not do.

Do you side with the internet’s gamer heroes, wearing Nyan cat shirts and crying out sarcastically for “moar Stonks, money printer go brrrr, number go up”! A post-Gawker-4chan swirl of human vectors, coalescing into one giant middle finger to every Karen and Ken? Dopamine splashing out from our pituitary glands into a vortex tornado of well-earned resentment.

Or, do you like your finance suited, ministerial, administrative and gated? Do you think it is storied, respectable and important. That you have to go to HYP and then do your “two and two” at Goldman and HBS before hopping to KKR or Tiger or SAC and then into your own cozy fund? All that work, all that sweat for the GMAT and the SAT and the bootlicking, to be undone by someone literally making fun of you in the language of money.

It’s not about some truth about Wall Street or Silicon Valley or the internet or bitcoin or decentralized finance (DeFi) and least of all about GameStop (GME). Those are just flags of our armies. And we are at war with ourselves.

GameStop is a mall shop that sold video games. The mall shops that rented videos (Blockbuster) or sold books (Borders) are bankrupt and rightly dead. The internet, and its children Netflix and Amazon, killed them. And yet, their names are etched into the collective childhood memories of millions. GameStop has no chance against Steam or Epic – both brands that are also deeply loved by nerds all over the world. We say this as self-incrimination. And yet, GameStop is a symbol, a feeling, a reminiscence.

The person building financial models and analyzing this stuff according to economics is “right” to point out bad things about “fundamentals” of the business. Within the game of financial capital markets, the fundamentals are the gears of the economic machines that you evaluate with capital decisions. You buy good fundamentals, says Warren Buffett and you sell bad ones. Another Warren, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, also believes in fundamentals. She believes in them so much she wants the government to regulate them into the market and “fair, orderly and efficient function.”

All that might be right, and we are not doubting the wisdom of John Maynard Keynes or the animal spirits. But Warren Buffett is no longer number one. It’s an Elon Musk world now.

Fundamentals are what the financial doctors will tell you that you have. Do you think the internet cares about their diagnosis? No. The internet cares about being patronized by people in coats. Musk and Chamath are the mushrooms of the internet. It is in their DNA.

The GameStop trade itself is worth a pause. While some of the original thinking by DeepF**kingValue that led to his $30+ million capital gain reflected on the GameStop business, the core insight was market structure. The trade was not about GameStop beating its analyst estimates or any of that boring-play-by-the-rules stuff. It was about a short squeeze. It was about restricting the supply of the stock in such a way as to blow up a levered short bet that Melvin Capital was putting into play.

In other words, we are talking about the meta-game, not the grunt Excel spreadsheet game. SAC, Tiger, Point72, Melvin Capital and every other hedge fund worth its salt plays the meta-game. That’s the whole point. You get a PhD in financial instruments by doing the work and testing the levers rather than believing in them blindly. And WallStreetBets dared to play the meta-game as well. Retail investors aren’t supposed to self-organize into a hive-mind of levered derivatives strategy driven by spite. And here we are.

To go short, Melvin has to borrow. To borrow, you have to pay an interest rate. To cover your short, you have to buy back the stock. You’re paying an interest rate and have to buy back the stock. Nobody is selling you the stock, because they hate you. Everyone is buying, to troll you specifically. They are levering up with options. And you keep raising your bids until you cover your position.

Robinhood is a broker/dealer. It came into being in Silicon Valley, a place where consumer services are free because they are actually not services but honeypots that aggregate user demand, package it at large scale and re-sell attention to advertisers. Such is Facebook and Google. Our lives are better because of these services, but also compromised and profoundly insane.

Robinhood uses this playbook to aggregate consumer demand with the honeypot of free trading, and then sends it to market makers like Citadel Securities and gets paid $600 million for the orders. TD Ameritrade and eTrade and other discount brokers do this, too! But Robinhood does it most, and does it best. Check out our prior explanation with Paul Rowady here.

There is nothing unusually nefarious going on. It is just American capital markets structure and a clever lead-generation arbitrage. That is, if customers are still getting best-execution with Citadel. But the structure is ancient by modern technology standards, and far from real-time. It takes two days for a trade to settle, and this among other reasons leads to a requirement of capital to be placed with a “clearing house,” in this case the DTCC. Given the volatility in GameSpot caused by the internet trying to break a hedge fund the way George Soros broke the Bank of England, capital requirements skyrocketed tenfold.

Robinhood, as well as TD Ameritrade, ended up restricting trading in the instrument as a result of this capital call. If you are burning and raising a billion dollars per year, you probably don’t have a “tenfold” of cash lying around to give to the DTCC to make it feel comfy. So, you know, it just removed the “Buy” button for a whole bunch of crusaders on a mission with their capital on the line. They didn’t remove the “Sell” button, thereby throwing fire on the internet conspiracy meme machine.

Was this done on instruction from Citadel billionaires? Was this the banksters colluding against the common person? Was “Wall Street” trying to take away our constitutional freedom to trade on a mobile app? Even U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez found common ground in finding someone to blame!

It’s not a lot of rioters yet.

But remember, fintech – including Robinhood, Revolut, SoFi and the rest – is supposed to democratize access to financial services. That meant very little a decade ago, and “dumb money” was disorganized and uninformed. Now, information is free and available to all. Equities trading is largely costless and frictionless. And the scariest part, for the suited part of finance anyway, is that strength lies in numbers and can now self-organize.

In addition to this, we have the crypto currency ecosystem. Unlike fintech, which went after distribution, blockchain goes after manufacturing. If you are a trader or market maker on Ethereum, there is no clearinghouse. There is no broker/dealer. There is only you and the distributed machine with its smart contracts, automated rule sets and software-enforced property rights. All data is real-time. The blocks click into being one after another without a single lawyerly piece of paper in sight. Hundreds of millions of people in the world have touched this asset class and it renders financial intermediaries unnecessary in their imagination.

Now don’t get us wrong. A trade on Ethereum is going to cost you $10 to $100 today, and another 1% in slippage. It is going to cost you some immeasurable but ever-present probability of cyber risk and regulatory overhang. But you nobody can take away your “Buy” or “Sell” button, and the speed and scale issues are mere technical problems to be solved by the entrepreneurial gods.

Here’s the rub, post-fintech-crypto-democratization and all.

Humans are social animals. It is in our bones. The concept of fairness has been selected through the evolutionary filter and fueled a cooperation-based multi-billion person civilization.

Democracy is not oligarchy. Democracy means each person has one vote. If you were to vote according to assets under management, which is how finance has done it to date, you get very different outcomes than when you vote person by person. Now we have a set of promises and representation from companies like Robinhood that suggest a democratic empowerment of individuals to access the storied products of finance. Most people don’t know, or want to know, how the actual machine works. When the promises have a gap to reality, because of whatever reason, this creates kinetic energy for Twitter and Reddit.

It creates energy for people in the position of leverage who understand the machine, and want it to change. Elon Musk hates short-sellers for their damping, and perhaps manipulating, effect on his promises of Tesla greatness. Certainly Chamath, having launched endless SPACs to take Silicon Valley fintech distributors like SoFi public, understands the machine as well. For them, this tear in the fabric of reality is a power. It is a rallying cry.

Retail investors aren’t supposed to self-organize into a hive-mind of levered derivatives strategy driven by spite. And here we are.

If we really want to put this into dystopian context, let’s at least reference the theory of overcrowding elites from Peter Turchin. The historian eerily predicted the 2020 rioting and disaffection back in 2010, suggesting that societies fall apart when they over-produce members of the ruling class. Education has minted PhDs, MBAs and entrepreneurs who have no seat to inherit from a retiring predecessor. As a result, they take on the populist mantle and position themselves as outsiders to attack the insiders, while of course being fabulously gifted. Thus Donald Trump and all the rest.

If you are holding power today you probably don’t want everything to fall apart just because Redditors hate a caricatured notion of hedge funds. So you tweak things at the edges. Edit out the glitches in the current matrix. It is through this lens that we see Google deleting 100,000 negative Robinhood reviews for being “inauthentic.”

Of course they were coordinated. But they were very authentic to the people who wrote them. They were, however, “inauthentic” to the current rule-set of the game. Based on fundamentals, market structure and a variety of other “this is how things work” explanations, Robinhood did nothing wrong. Nor did Melvin, really, as far as we can tell from the media coverage. It just played a game that has become a cartoon that millions of people despise. Google’s app store is also an incumbent, a rule-set as well of what constitutes good behavior and what you should do according to its Terms, and so on. Protecting Robinhood’s reputation because it did not fundamentally err is what you do when you believe the current system works.","['capital', 'robinhood', 'sokolin', 'old', 'gamestop', 'hedge', 'billion', 'person', 'fund', 'financial', 'using', 'market', 'internet', 'democratize', 'cant', 'finance', 'tech']","The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, is raising the crypto rallying flag and ex-Facebook billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya is trading along with Reddit for quick profits, decentralized hedge fund and all.

Chaos ensued. Retail traders everywhere cried foul, accusing the startup brokerage of protecting hedge funds and the establishment at their expense. U.S. politicians across the spectrum, from Rep. AOC to Sen. Ted Cruz, came together to lambast the move on Twitter. Venture capitalists and technologists called into question the morality of Robinhood’s founders and proclaimed that the moment for decentralization had finally arrived.

Robinhood did not halt trading of GameStop to punish the insurgent mass of retail traders. Nor did it do so out of a paternalistic impulse to try to protect them. Robinhood halted trading of GameStop because it had to, thanks to a set of standards put in place by market players upstream. Robinhood’s clearing firm, the company that facilitates the settlement of the broker-dealer’s trades, could not keep up with the risk it was being asked to take on.

Jill Carlson, a CoinDesk columnist, is co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, a non-profit research organization working to guarantee the right to a free and open financial system. She is also an investor in early-stage startups with Slow Ventures.

Clearing firms exist in part to mitigate the consequences should a broker-dealer fail to meet its obligations. Clearing firms therefore need to keep a tight handle on risk. This means they need to put up more money to make good on trades as markets get whackier and whackier (that is, as volatility increases). The GameStop market was about as whacky as it gets. The clearing firm couldn’t take on any more risk. Robinhood couldn’t fork over any more funds to the clearing firm. The music had to stop.

These are precisely the type of controls that became so clearly important in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis: strict risk management, transparency, liquidity thresholds, and capital requirements. These standards were designed to prevent reckless behavior and to mitigate the fallout should a financial firm become overexposed. When retail traders demanded these rules be implemented on big institutions 10 years ago, they couldn’t have imagined those rules would someday shut them out of the market.

Yesterday highlights the importance of understanding all of the boring nuances of trading back offices and the standards, rules, regulations and protocols that go along with them. Settling a trade takes two days. Thus, clearing firms have two days of exposure to their counterparty firm.

Why does it take two days? People love to say this is a technology issue and that innovations like blockchains can fix this. The reality is, as with so many things that people claim blockchains can fix that this issue is almost entirely one of process and regulation. Perhaps new technology can be a catalyst to revisit these, but it is certainly not the limiting factor.

The Securities and Exchange Commission mandates settlement periods for securities to keep processes among counterparties running smoothly. There are plenty of short-term securities that do settle the same day like certificates of deposit and commercial paper. Equities take as long as they do in part because of historical precedent, dating from the times when technology was indeed the constraint. Every financial institution became accustomed to the processes involved in multi-day settlement periods. Financial institutions are generally slowly evolving creatures, meaning that which they are used to is that which they prefer. Because their processes are built around multi-day settlement, they continue to choose multi-day settlement. The solution to this is not a blockchain anymore than it is a centralized database.

Robinhood halted trading of GameStop because it had to, thanks to a set of standards put in place by market players upstream.

It is so tempting to turn these conversations into conversations about technology. If only we had a decentralized financial trading platform, we would be saved from the censorship imposed by Robinhood or clearing firms or the SEC, the thinking goes. If only we had equities on a blockchain, we would be saved from two day settlement periods and the risks and inefficiencies they impose.

But the issues lie not with the technology. They lie with the way the protocols, processes, rules and laws around the market were designed. And these kinds of issues do not go away no matter how decentralized your trading venue is or how many blockchains you are using.

There are, to be sure, many archaic and obsolete practices that those in charge of the markets continue to adhere to. But it is all too easy to blindly rail against these or to blame them on technology without examining where these practices came from or why they exist. In the most extreme cases, these processes prevail for risk management reasons. In more innocuous cases, these practices simply emerged from the human behavior of those interacting with the markets.

When XRP was de-platformed earlier this month by Coinbase and many others there was not a sudden rush of liquidity and activity on decentralized exchanges that list the asset. That is because traders did not want to touch the asset given the regulatory concerns around the asset.

Take also the question of whether markets should be open and active 24 hours, 7 days per week, 365 days per year. This is another area where I frequently hear people saying that new technology would resolve this, pointing to cryptocurrency markets that are always open. But there are already plenty of mainstream markets that are always open. All over-the-counter markets work this way on Wall Street. If I want to do an over-the-counter trade, I can theoretically call up a market maker any time and ask for a price. In all likelihood, though, I don’t want to. I want to wait for times when there is liquidity.

So much of how the financial market works is based on historical human behaviors, either codifying them into market standards or erecting guardrails against their natural tendencies. To be sure, developments of the last weeks and years demonstrate that many of these policies and procedures are worth revisiting. Cryptocurrency markets have proven that there might be demand for 24/7 markets, at least in some asset classes. GameStop has shown that certain retail broker-dealers might need to be better capitalized to anticipate the kind of groundswell behavior we have seen this week.","['risk', 'jill', 'carlson', 'problem', 'clearing', 'stop', 'financial', 'standards', 'market', 'markets', 'gamestop', 'settlement', 'technology', 'trading']","Robinhood did not halt trading of GameStop to punish the insurgent mass of retail traders.

This was the week the internet finally defeated Wall Street – at least for a few days. The wild rally in GameStop’s stock, fueled by an army of Reddit retail day traders, imposed devastating losses on hedge funds and showed how free trading tools and social media (memes) can now be harnessed by networks of individuals to achieve economic outcomes previously controlled by elites. The gobsmacking story of GameStop, Melvin Capital and r/WallStreetbets was tailor-made for the disruptive, anti-establishment vibe of the crypto community. This “WSB effect” theme runs throughout this week’s newsletter.

On the other side of the masses vs. establishment divide, this was also the week of the “Davos Agenda” virtual event, held in lieu of the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting. It included the likes of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Chinese President Xi Zinping, a host of Fortune 500 CEOs and so forth.

My podcast co-host Sheila Warren, who happens to be the WEF’s blockchain lead, invited long-time WEF Managing Director Adrian Monck to this week’s “Money Reimagined” show. We talked directly about how the old guard deals with the changes that radical outsiders, such as crypto developers and tribes of activist retail investors, present.

BTC and ETH: Made for each other

As of 11:00 a.m. ET Friday, the year-to-date returns for bitcoin and ether show an easily discernible reversal of the BTC dominance seen in late 2020. Bitcoin is up 27% year to date and ether, 92%.

What’s going on here? Well, before we try to answer that, a caveat: If the past week’s WallStreetBets-vs-hedge funds spectacle has taught us anything, it’s that in today’s meme-consuming, radically democratizing markets, confidently defining fundamental reasons for price movements is difficult. What matters is which narrative is winning.

Well, before we try to answer that, a caveat: If the past week’s WallStreetBets-vs-hedge funds spectacle has taught us anything, it’s that in today’s meme-consuming, radically democratizing markets, confidently defining fundamental reasons for price movements is difficult. What matters is which narrative is winning. Narrative? So prices are just make-believe? Well, yes, but stories have always been about how people – and thus markets – reach consensus. It used to be Wall Street controlled the narrative. It’s unclear whether that’s still the case.

Well, yes, but stories have always been about how people – and thus markets – reach consensus. It used to be Wall Street controlled the narrative. It’s unclear whether that’s still the case. So, what narrative best explains ETH outperforming BTC? Well, let’s first challenge the “Tulip Bubble” angle that mainstream crypto critics might instinctively apply here: The idea this is a rerun of the 2017 bitcoin rally, which pushed speculators into comparatively cheaper tokens only to foster the mother of all bubbles. The loss suffered this week by short-selling hedge funds at the expense of hordes of retail investors from the r/WallStreetBets subreddit shows it’s dangerous to conclude that large groups of determined bulls are inherently wrong.



This is not to say ETH’s price won’t correct as bitcoin’s has this month. It just means we owe it to ourselves to explore other narratives.

This is not to say ETH’s price won’t correct as bitcoin’s has this month. It just means we owe it to ourselves to explore other narratives. Such as? Here’s one: There’s a BTC-to-ETH price rotation going on that suggests thoughtful investors are starting to see Ethereum, and more specifically the decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built on it, as a constructive complement to Bitcoin. As sophisticated investors increasingly recognize bitcoin’s potential as a “digital gold” store of wealth, the thesis goes, they will soon see DeFi as a means to creatively unlock that value – for payments, for loans, for insurance, and so forth.



This take sees Bitcoin as the base layer protocol for a software stack that handles the internet’s value storage and exchange. Bitcoin the currency is a simple yet hard-to-change, highly secure store of value. Much like gold, it doesn’t do much; you just lock it away and use it as security to back up your other investments and financial activity. But because it’s built on a permissionless protocol, developers can still do many more creative things with it than, say, a gold custodian can do with bullion.



That’s where Ethereum and DeFi come in. With smart contracts, oracles, decentralized exchanges and multi-sig systems for securing digital assets, the degens of DeFi are now incorporating bitcoin into their freewheeling, “composable” world of decentralized financial products. Hence the summer explosion of wrapped bitcoin tokens such as WBTC.



To go back to the software stack analogy, Ethereum is middleware and DeFi occupies the application layer.

Analogies are also being made to the traditional finance “stack.” RealVision CEO Raoul Pal says bitcoin is “pristine collateral” that could even take on the $123 trillion market for U.S. Treasury bonds as the base-level security for all credit. It’s appeal is not only that it’s a provably scarce asset, but also that it can be locked up in escrow through a decentralized smart contract that leaves neither lenders nor borrowers vulnerable to the failures of a middleman. You build DeFi’s lending, borrowing and insuring products on top of that feature and you now have the makings of a financial system.

Asked by CoinDesk contributor Jeff Wilser if he would ever see bitcoin as something more than a speculative investment, Dallas Mavericks owner and CNBC “Shark Tank” personality Mark Cuban responded, “Sure. If DeFi and BTC can evolve together in a manner that allows BTC to effectively be a bank account without the bank. That creates utility for BTC.” What does he think of Ethereum? “I like ETH. Obviously it’s a primary foundation for DeFi, and we will see what happens with ETH 2.”

Obviously it’s a primary foundation for DeFi, and we will see what happens with ETH 2.” Ah, Eth 2. The Elephant in the Room. If Ethereum 2.0 succeeds, over the next couple of years the blockchain will transition from a proof-of-work consensus model to proof-of-stake and will allow massively more transaction-processing capability. That scalability is needed if Ethereum is to play a meaningful role in the global financial system. But the transition is incredibly difficult to pull off within a large, decentralized community of users where billions of dollars are at stake.



Still, there seems to be early optimism around Eth 2.0. The amount of ether locked and staked on the transitional Beacon Chain has steadily risen to more than 2.8 million ETH as of Wednesday (an amount currently worth about $3.89 billion). Indeed, ether’s steady January gain to an all-time high of $1,476.12 on Sunday was itself an expression of confidence in that project.

And there’s support, including from suddenly in-the-news social media platform Reddit, for using so-called layer 2 scaling solutions such as Plasma to expand Ethereum’s use cases. Meanwhile, EY blockchain lead Paul Brody is predicting financial institutions will bring DeFi to the masses.



All of this points to an expanding and diversifying Ethereum ecosystem. For a blockchain, that’s the best story you can tell: a growing network.

Did Trump help bitcoin’s late-2020 surge?

Since we’re talking about narratives, let’s look at how we might visually represent a market-justifying story. I’ve chosen a take by CoinDesk Global News Editor Kevin Reynolds on the role played by fears of electoral chaos on bitcoin’s price rise during the late fall and early winter. I can buy this story: If bitcoin is digital gold, it should work as a backstop against dystopia. But what I also found interesting was how easy it was to illustrate this idea on a chart. I just grabbed a few election-related statements by former President Donald Trump and his supporters, got CoinDesk data visualizer Shuai Hao to mark them on a four-month chart from our subsidiary company TradeBlock and the yellow line did the rest.

TradeBlock XBX (Shuai Hao/CoinDesk) Source: https://tradeblock.com/markets/index

(NOTE: This chart was produced late Thursday New York time, before bitcoin’s huge leap to a new post-Jan. 8 high of $38,000 early Friday morning. The story may need a new chapter. Arrival of the WSB effect?)

Kevin argues that electoral fear added an extra $10,000 to the all-time high that was hit right after the climactic Jan. 6 raid on Congress. The rest of the gains came from the standard stuff everyone was talking about: mainly that institutional investors were now adding bitcoin to their long-term portfolios. So, when things simmered down and new President Joseph Biden was sworn in, bitcoin’s price eased to what would be fair value in normal times – you know, amid a normal global pandemic and economic depression.

The Conversation: Ants vs. elephants

In 2014, when the idea of decentralized autonomous organizations was first being kicked around, crypto pioneer and DAO enthusiast Joel Dietz founded a decentralized fundraising platform called “Swarm.” (It has since evolved into Swarm Capital, which provides tools for companies to issue security tokens.) The name always struck me as an evocative one for an entity comprising many individuals without centralized control.

Now, after digesting this heady week on Wall Street, the term seems especially apt. I’m talking, of course, about how retail investors in a Subreddit that quickly swelled to 4.4 million people collectively forced big hedge funds into a “short squeeze” on supposedly has-been “meme stocks” such as GameStop, AMC Entertainment and BlackBerry. The WSB group maneuver imposed billions of dollars of losses on those institutions. Melvin Capital needed an injection of $2.75 billion from Citadel and Point72. One thinks of a swarm of ants attacking elephants.

That the name stems from a crypto venture is also fitting since the WSB saga prompted an outpouring of interest from the crypto community. It had all the elements of a crypto drama, even though the battle never occurred on a blockchain.

For one, there was a much-discussed CNBC interview with Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya, who had spent time trawling through the r/WallStreetBets posts and, following the group’s lead, made a $500,000 profit. Declaring that what he “learned over the last couple of days is important for everybody that’s watching CNBC,” Chamath said the insurgent investor movement was “a pushback against the establishment in a very important way,” one that harked back to the 2008 financial crisis. It captured the rebellious, anti-Wall Street vibe that’s long been part of the crypto community.

As the drama unfolded, Crypto Twitter lit up with people drawing parallels with and lessons about the crypto scene.

In a tweet thread about people demanding change to a system rigged for the big guys, Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz said the movement was “a giant endorsement of DeFi.”

Then, on Thursday, when the Redditors’ favored trading app, Robinhood, shut down access to the the stocks in question – creating a vitriolic backlash in what one observer called the trading app’s own “Streisand Effect” – the crypto community leapt to remind the world that this could never happen on a decentralized exchange. It was the perfect opportunity for Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift, to weigh in about his company’s new decentralized offering.

Then, inevitably, the WSB phenomenon spread into the crypto world’s very own “meme token,” Dogecoin, which soared more than 800% to a new record high.

Going into the year-end was an exciting period for bitcoiners. Many large-name investors emerged to declare their appreciation of bitcoin’s potential and the price responded accordingly.

As the price dropped back in the latter part of January, the “institutions are coming” rallying cry tempered. Big-name investors still showed interest in bitcoin, but some of their messages emphasized their caution and focused on the challenges they still see bitcoin facing before it attains a widely recognized place in institutional portfolios. CoinDesk’s coverage this past week captured that. (We’ll have to see how next week’s stories look if bitcoin holds the gains it enjoyed Friday morning and as these institutions take stock of the powerful reckoning they’ve been confronted via a retail investor insurrection.)

Guggenheim Partners Chief Investment Officer Scott Minerd, who made waves last year when he assigned a long-term target of $400,000 to bitcoin, didn’t exactly retract that prediction but added an implicit “not any time soon” caveat. In a Bloomberg interview he said, “Right now, the reality of the institutional demand that would support a $35,000 price or even a $30,000 price is just not there.” After Friday’s jump, that comment is looking a little off.

Journalists are always looking for comments from Dallas Mavericks owner and CNBC “Shark Tank” personality Marc Cuban. Crypto journalists are no exception. So, we were thrilled that CoinDesk contributor Jeff Wilser had a rich exchange with Cuban this week. As discussed above, Cuban sees real potential in bitcoin, especially if it can team up with DeFi. But as a standalone investment for now, his current view is, let’s say, “meh.”

We’ve also long been trying to get legendary Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio’s thoughts on bitcoin. He has remained mostly skeptical, even if his tone has become moderately more upbeat over time and his view has emerged only via small snippets of commentary. Finally, in his widely read Daily Observations newsletter, Dalio and his team have delivered a detailed, deep-dive analysis of bitcoin’s opportunities and challenges. I’d say Dalio still has a small amount of learning to do – for example, on why bitcoin can’t easily be replaced by a “better” cryptocurrency – but otherwise this is a brilliant analysis. His team’s assessment of bitcoin’s infamous volatility and why that makes it hard for portfolio managers to adopt it as loss-mitigating uncorrelated asset is masterful. (Oh, and I’m super excited to tell you that Dalio will be a headline keynote at CoinDesk’s Consensus event in May. Stay tuned for more exciting speaker announcements as we update the events page.)

Perhaps the most important news of the week on the institutional investor side was Ian Allison’s scoop that the trustees who run the endowments of Harvard, Yale, Brown and other universities have been investing in bitcoin for over a year.

Bitcoin’s algorithmically determined rate of increase certainly makes it scarce when demand for the bitcoin cryptocurrency is rising, though not so much when it is falling. Furthermore, the fact that the algorithm provides for bitcoin’s supply to stop increasing about 120 years from now means that its supply is finite. Unless the code is changed (and that raises questions about what “Bitcoin” even means), there can never be more than 21 million bitcoins.

As I will show, however, bitcoin’s scarcity doesn’t stem from its finite nature, but from potentially infinite – though fickle – demand. And its legendary volatility is linked less to its scarcity or its finite nature and more to its inherent inflexibility. These distinctions may sound slight, but I argue they amount to important revisions of our understanding of this technology.

Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book, “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing,” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.

Scarcity is hardly unique to bitcoin. All assets are scarce. Indeed anything that has a price is scarce, by definition. If there is no scarcity, there is no price. Things that are so abundant that everyone can have all they want are free, even if they are objectively valuable to humans. Air, for example, is free, though it is so valuable to humans that we can’t exist without it.

Price is the mechanism by which markets equilibrate the supply of, and demand for, scarce objects. When there is more demand for a product than supply, the price rises until demand falls sufficiently for supply to be adequate. This means some people’s demand for the product will be partly or completely unsatisfied. In a free market, it is normal – indeed necessary – for people to be priced out of the market.

Conversely, when there is a greater supply of a product than demand, its price falls until demand rises sufficiently to mop up the excess. In retail markets, price falls might take the form of discounting and special offers.

Sometimes there is no demand for a product at any price, even a negative one. “You can’t pay people to take it away,” as the saying goes. There may be a limited supply of these things no one wants, but it is ridiculous to call them “scarce.” There are far too many of them. When there is an over-supply of a product, it becomes not simply worthless but costly to the holder because it incurs storage and disposal charges.

This brings me to what I regard as the fundamental problem with the definition of scarcity used by Bitcoin’s advocates. They confuse “scarce” with finite. It’s not necessary for something to have a fixed supply for it to be scarce; and things whose supply is constantly increasing are not necessarily abundant.

The passenger pigeon

To illustrate the difference between abundant, scarce and finite, let’s consider the sad story of the passenger pigeon, a bird once native to the U.S. but now extinct.

Back in the 19th century, passenger pigeons were so abundant that observers described them as “darkening the sky” in flight. They were a serious nuisance to crops but a free source of meat and eggs. So people were paid to kill them.

See also: Frances Coppola – Banks Are Toast but Crypto Has Lost Its Soul

As people killed passenger pigeons by the millions and destroyed their forest breeding grounds, their numbers crashed. Lawmakers did not believe that something so abundant could ever become scarce, so attempts to protect the bird with legislation failed, The carnage continued and the species went into terminal decline.

The last wild bird is thought to have been shot in 1901. The birds survived in zoos for a few more years, but breeding proved impossible. The last passenger pigeon, Martha, died in the Cincinnati Zoo on Sept. 1, 1914. She was (and remains, since after her death she was stuffed) a bird of infinite value, the last of her kind and the icon of her species.

While passenger pigeons still existed in the wild, their supply was not finite. They nested, laid eggs and brought up chicks. But the rate at which they reproduced could not keep up with the rate at which humans were destroying them, so they became scarce. If humans had stopped shooting them and stealing their eggs, their supply would have increased again. In contrast, if bitcoins are lost, they can never be replaced. The supply is permanently reduced. So bitcoins are finite, but the passenger pigeon was not.

Bitcoin is therefore intrinsically volatile, not because of its scarcity or its finite nature, but because of its inflexibility.

The passenger pigeon became scarce not because it had a finite supply, but because demand for it far exceeded the rate at which its supply was increasing. And because humans refused to believe it was becoming scarce, its price failed to rise to match supply and demand. The “stickiness” of the passenger pigeon’s zero price ensured its demise. This is a type of market failure known as the “tragedy of the commons.” As Joni Mitchell sang, “You don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone.”

Towards its end, the passenger pigeon became both scarce and finite because it would not breed in captivity. That ultimately is why it became extinct. But had the zoos been able to establish successful breeding programs, the passenger pigeon would not have been finite. It might still be with us today. And like all endangered species, it would now be protected by law. Endangered species aren’t finite but they are so scarce and valuable that people risk their lives to protect them.

So it is not a finite supply that creates scarcity. It is a persistent excess of demand over supply. In a well-functioning market, if demand for a product rises faster than its supply, its price will rise even though its supply is increasing.

For some kinds of good, there are natural limits to demand: Everyone needs water, but there is a limit to how much water people can drink. However, drinkable water is scarce and the population is growing. Even if the supply of drinkable water increases, therefore, it will remain scarce as long as the rate of increase is the same or lower than the rate of increase of the population.

But for other types of good, such as gold and bitcoin, demand is potentially insatiable. The price of these things should therefore rise continually even if the supply is uncapped and continually increasing, provided the rate of increase is not so great that people lose interest. So it’s possible to continually create more of something without making it so abundant that it becomes worthless.

What this means for bitcoin

And this brings me back to bitcoin. Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap does not make it scarce. After all, 21 million of things no one wants is abundance (or “oversupply”), not scarcity. Like every asset, bitcoin is scarce when demand for it exceeds the available supply. When demand crashes, as it did in 2014 and 2018, bitcoin can’t really be said to be scarce, even though the supply hasn’t increased. However, Bitcoin’s supply algorithm does affect the price because it makes it impossible for bitcoin’s supply to respond to demand. Just as passenger pigeons couldn’t increase their rate of reproduction to compensate for the rate at which humans were killing them, so Bitcoin can’t increase or reduce its rate of production to compensate for changes in demand for bitcoins. And in a well-functioning market, when supply can’t respond to demand, the price must adjust.","['rate', 'scarce', 'passenger', 'demand', 'scarcity', 'bitcoins', 'rethinking', 'finite', 'price', 'bitcoin', 'supply', 'frances', 'coppola']","Furthermore, the fact that the algorithm provides for bitcoin’s supply to stop increasing about 120 years from now means that its supply is finite.

XRP prices fell from $0.55 to $0.20 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced a lawsuit against Ripple Labs on Dec. 22, triggering a number of exchange delistings of the cryptocurrency. The regulator charged the company with violating securities laws by raising $1.3 billion over seven years from retail investors through its sales of XRP.

Ripple Labs pushed back against the SEC’s allegations on Friday, arguing the functionality and liquidity of XRP are wholly incompatible with securities regulation, and its registration as a security would impair its main utility in faster, cheaper and more transparent global payments.

The cryptocurrency picked up a strong bid on Saturday, rising 56% to register its biggest single-day gain in three years, and has remained on the offensive ever since.

A coordinated effort by the members of the two-day-old Telegram group called “Buy & Hold XRP” alongside calls to buy XRP by the r/SatoshiStreetBets group seems to have helped push the cryptocurrency to multi-month highs. At press time, the Telegram pump group had 200,000 members.

However, some observers are of the opinion the Telegram traders may not be the sole drivers of the price rise. “24H volume on XRP on Sunday was over $26 billion. Even if each of the groups’ members dropped $5,000 on XRP, that equates to 2% of total daily volume. Let’s be rational here – no Telegram group is pumping the 5th largest coin in the space,” popular Twitter-based analyst Credible Crypto tweeted Sunday.

The cryptocurrency is trading near $0.66 at press time, representing a nearly 30% gain on the day.

Meanwhile, the number of whale entities – clusters of crypto wallet addresses held by a single network participant holding at least 1,000 BTC – jumped to a new record high of 2,218 on Sunday. The count has increased by over 50 during the recent bout of price consolidation in a sign of continued accumulation by investors large enough to influence market trends.

Lastly, the odds of a deeper drop due to profit-taking appear low, as the 24-hour average of bitcoin’s adjusted spent output ratio (aSOPR), recently fell to 1.00, indicating that coins moving between investors are no longer carrying profit. The SOPR metric measures the profit ratio of coins based on the prices when they last moved. The aSOPR ignores all outputs with a lifespan of less than one hour.

Investors typically sell at a loss during bear markets, but bitcoin is currently in a bull market, having rallied by 200% in the past three months.

“For SOPR to go lower, investors would have to be willing to sell at a loss, which is unlikely given the current shape of the market. We have been looking for this reset to generate some stability in the market and pave the way for the next bull run,” Glassnode recently said. Historically, values below 1.0 have been consistently rejected during bull markets.

So, the odds appear stacked in favor of a convincing bitcoin move above $40,000. “The breakout may happen in two weeks; everything is bullish now,” trader and analyst Alex Kruger told CoinDesk over Twitter.

Kruger, however, cited potential dollar strength as a short-term risk to bitcoin’s bullish outlook. The Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback’s value against major currencies, is looking north, with the daily chart reporting an inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) breakout – a major bullish pattern (below right).

“If a bullish trend develops from DXY’s latest breakout, it could be a problem for bitcoin,” Kruger said. The breakout has opened the doors for a rise to 93.00. The DXY is trading near 91.12 at press time, little changed on the day.

Matthew Dibb, COO and co-founder of Stack Funds, voiced similar concerns while drawing attention to the fact that bitcoin’s rally from early November lows near $14,000 happened alongside the DXY’s decline from 94.5 to 89.00.

Bitcoin has moved mainly in the opposite direction to the U.S. dollar since the March markets crash, with the cryptocurrency witnessing consolidation or pullbacks during bouts of strength in USD. Bitcoin’s recent decline from record highs and the subsequent consolidation has been accompanied by a recovery rally in the dollar.

The inverse correlation between the two is likely the result of the dollar’s negative correlation to the appetite for risk in the global financial markets.

“Whenever risk sentiment deteriorates around the globe there is a natural desire to move to safety in the form of the U.S. dollar. And by extension, bitcoin, which is still an emerging asset, is exposed to risk-off,” Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital, told CoinDesk.

However, the dollar’s overall trend looks bearish, courtesy of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s open-ended money printing strategy, and analysts remain confident about bitcoin’s long-term prospects.

“Both for the medium and long term, bitcoin remains attractive and, ultimately, on that longer-term proposition, bitcoin should become an in-demand currency during periods of risk-off,” Kruger said.","['bitcoins', 'price', 'point', 'dollar', 'bullish', 'market', 'kruger', 'source', 'renewed', 'risk', 'rally', 'bitcoin', 'fundamentals', 'breakout', 'ahead']","Bitcoin exchange balance Source: GlassnodeThe balance of bitcoin held across all exchanges fell to a 2.5-year low of 2,349,040 on Monday, according to Glassnode.

Bitcoin’s price is gaining Tuesday, going as high as $35,645 around 10:00 UTC (5 a.m. ET) before dipping somewhat.

“I think we’ll see more interest in bitcoin again if we move solidly above $35,000,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for Swissquote Bank. “On the support side for bitcoin is institutional buying in the low $30,000s.”

Some exhaustion recently in the bitcoin market may have been caused by speculative activity in the stock market.

“So much attention has been on U.S. equities markets as of late, a lot of the mainstream and crypto outlets have been much less focused on driving the formation of opinions of traders and hodlers,” said John Willock, chief executive officer of crypto custody provider Tritum.

Equities on major indexes were all up Tuesday.

In addition to the bullish sentiment keeping stocks buoyant, it should be noted the price per 1 BTC has been able to stay above $30,000 for quite a while.

The last time bitcoin’s closing price was under $30,000, according to CoinDesk 20 data, was on New Year’s Day, when it closed at $29,333. It hasn’t looked back since.

“More than anything else, we should all take the long-term sustained price levels above the 2017 high of $20,000 now over a month as the best possible endorsement of bitcoin being a long-term bullish asset,” added Tritum’s Willock.

“Generally speaking, I think that the market is accepting higher prices while trying to digest the volatility,” noted Neil Van Huis, director of institutional trading at crypto liquidity provider Blockfills.

Bitcoin’s gyrations seem to have subsided somewhat, helped by a very flat weekend into Monday. As of Feb. 1, bitcoin’s 30-day volatility has trended downward; but it is still above 100%, which is quite high. The S&P 500, by comparison, has a 30-day volatility below 20%.

In the options market, traders are expecting a 62% chance of BTC over $32,000, based on their positions for February expirations. They seem to expect a 53% chance of trading over $34,000 and a 44% probability of bitcoin moving higher than $36,000, according to data collected by Skew.

Ether hits new price zenith, crypto locked in DeFi at all-time high

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, jumped Tuesday, trading around $1,526 and climbing 14.4% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET) – a fresh all-time high, according to CoinDesk 20 data.

The total value locked, or TVL, of crypto in U.S. dollar terms within decentralized finance (DeFi) is also hitting a brand-new high, going over $28 billion locked and at $28.8 billion as of press time, according to data aggregator DeFi Pulse.

Jun Dam, a smart-contract developer who has written code on the Ethereum and Tron platforms, noted that many decentralized exchanges have numerous pairs with ETH, and speculates traders may be selling some of their stash for DeFi tokens. “It seems like total DEX volume has increased significantly in 2021,” Dam told CoinDesk.

“DeFi is definitely the flavor,” concurred Swissquote’s Thomas. “There’s still good value out there if you consider the possibility that more people will move to DEXs in the next 12 months [and that] arguably the DEXs are still undervalued.”

USDC on exchanges “represents almost $1 billion worth of buying power from USDC alone, poised to move into assets” such as bitcoin, according to Glassnode’s weekly newsletter dated Feb 1. “This high figure should increase investors’ confidence in any dips being quickly bought up, making it a bullish signal.”

As CoinDesk reported Tuesday, some analysts see several on-chain metrics for bitcoin’s price pointing in a bullish direction in the coming weeks. For example, a decreased amount of bitcoin held on exchange addresses indicates less pressure on the sell side.

In crypto trading, traders and investors often use stablecoins to put money into riskier cryptocurrencies; in such cases, buying stablecoins backed by government-issued currencies is seen as the first step necessary before buying other cryptocurrencies.

“The growth in on-exchange USDC reflects the increasing view among traders that USDC is a preferred base currency, as well as the fact that a lot of the new flows into crypto are starting with on-exchange activity,” Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of peer-to-peer payments company Circle, told CoinDesk through a spokesperson. He noted that USDC issuance in January saw “record levels.” Circle and crypto exchange Coinbase are behind USDC’s governing Centre consortium.

The circulating supply of USDC, which is valued 1:1 with the U.S. dollar, has grown to over 5 billion from just below 4 billion in the beginning of the month, sharp growth after slowing in October, according to data from Glassnode.

Increased exchange activity is also reflected in the significant price rise of exchanges’ utility tokens. Centralized exchanges Binance and FTX and decentralized exchanges Uniswap and SushiSwap all saw their exchange tokens hit new all-time highs in the past week.

As of press time, MakerDAO did not respond to CoinDesk’s requests for comment regarding its dai stablecoin.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market value briefly topped $1,500, hitting $1,500.63, during early U.S. trading hours on Tuesday, passing the previous record price $1,459.93 last month, according to CoinDesk 20 data. In recent trading, ETH was at 1.494.26, up 14.28% over the last 24 hours.

The latest leg higher from $1,200 came alongside turmoil in the stock markets, where brokerage platforms like Robinhood have restricted transactions to rein volatility fueled by Reddit-based retail traders’ coordinated buying in stocks such as GameStop. The retail frenzy prompted by Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets forced hedge funds to unwind short bets in GameStop, leading to a 1,700% price rally in the 17 days to Jan. 28.

Crypto analysts believe the restrictive actions could bring more users into the DeFi space, which is dominated by Ethereum’s blockchain.

“With investment and trading platform Robinhood halting trading of certain assets like GameStop and Nokia (NOK), and Nasdaq President and CEO Adena Friedman calling for regulations to prevent retail investors from coordinating on social media, the case for cryptocurrencies only grows stronger,” Nicholas Pelecanos, head of trading at NEM Group, told CoinDesk.

According to Messari’s Ryan Selkis, the door for mass adoption of bitcoin, ethereum, DeFi and Web 3.0 assets has been flung open. “Buy ethereum to secure the fledging decentralized financial system and potentially make a lot of money, but also to tell your bank to f**k off,” Selkis noted in Thursday’s daily market brief.

Job losses at IBM (NYSE: IBM) escalated as the company failed to meet its revenue targets for the once-fêted technology by 90% this year, according to one of the sources.

“IBM is doing a major reorganization,” said a source at a startup that has been interviewing former IBM blockchain staffers. “There is not really going to be a blockchain team any longer. Most of the blockchain people at IBM have left.”

IBM’s blockchain unit missed its revenue targets by a wide margin for two years in a row, said a second source. Expectations for enterprise blockchain were too high, they said, adding that IBM “didn’t really manage to execute, despite doing a lot of announcements.”

A spokesperson for IBM denied the claims.

“Our blockchain business is doing well, thank you,” Holli Haswell, a director of public relations at IBM, said via email. “We have realigned some leaders and business units to continue to drive growth – we do that every year.”

A former IBM staffer who had been working on enterprise blockchain, however, said there have been a succession of “Resource Actions,” or RAs, which basically means firing people based on business performance as opposed to personal performance.

“I would wager less than 10% [of the blockchain product and engineering team] is still working on IBM Blockchain,” said the ex-IBM source. “There have been tons of reorgs. Pretty much everyone is gone. IBM is now 100% focused on hybrid cloud, so everything that doesn’t support that is deprioritized.”

IBM has pumped a lot of money into blockchain since 2016, when it began talking about the technology’s potential to transform the way industries do business.

If IBM’s blockchain innovation work is now confined to some R&D, and does not even extend to consulting, as one of the sources said, this sounds an ominous note for the enterprise blockchain space in general – perhaps particularly for the Hyperledger collection of blockchains, to which IBM was a key contributor.

In its recent full-year results statement, IBM as a whole reported revenue fell 6% on an annualized basis. Looking back to its 2017 financial statement, IBM called itself the “blockchain leader for business.” All mention of the technology is now absent from the company’s statements.

No more TV commercials

In the past several years, IBM has pushed ahead with a series of blockchain networks built on Hyperledger Fabric. Big Blue’s major blockchain networks are FoodTrust, a farm-to-supermarket tracking system backed by Walmart; and TradeLens, a shipping container logistics blockchain backed by Maersk. IBM has also added the Trust Your Supplier network and previously had a go at payments via World Wire.

While cryptocurrencies and public blockchain networks appear to have flourished in 2020, the economic shock of COVID-19 has impacted innovation departments inside large firms, to the extent that areas not immediately generating revenue – such as blockchain – have been trimmed.

Another source, an enterprise blockchain engineer with former ties to IBM, estimated more than 100 blockchain-related jobs were cut at Big Blue over the last year.

The source also pointed out that Jerry Cuomo, IBM’s head of blockchain and an evangelist for the tech going back to 2016, has been moved and is now working on artificial intelligence.

“Jerry is indeed overseeing additional strategic, high-growth parts of the IBM business but is still involved in blockchain,” said Haswell, the company spokesperson. “He is a very senior technical leader and that is what we do in IBM – people’s roles expand.”

After publication of this article, Haswell further disputed the reporting, adding:

""IBM maintains a strong team dedicated to blockchain across the company. We have shifted some resources but remain committed to the technology, blockchain ecosystem and services. We see blockchain as a driver for our cloud business.""

On Jan. 7 the total cryptocurrency market hit an all-time high exceeding $1 trillion for the first time. Renewed interest in, and conversations around, blockchain technology and digital currencies from industry and government leaders have accompanied the rise.

At the same time, the challenges of 2020 continue, including the global pandemic. COVID-19 dominated the recent Davos agenda, with the need for digital solutions and real-time multi-party access to consistent information highlighted across multiple sectors.

At the World Economic Forum, we will continue to work with hundreds of experts from governments, business, civil society and academia to bring together the seemingly disparate worlds of crypto and long-standing institutions.

Sheila Warren is the Head of Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology at the World Economic Forum.

Here are some of the top trends we are watching this year:

Identity

All eyes are on digital identity for COVID-related needs – but long-term strategies and implications remain to be seen.

The COVID-19 crisis has increased consumer demand for identity solutions that don’t compromise individual privacy and freedoms. Of course, ideas of what constitutes the ideal level of privacy preservation vary widely around the world, with China and the U.S. taking deeply divergent perspectives. As the travel industry and various governments continue to explore ideas like “immunity passports,” which would maintain vaccination and/or testing records, the creation of a global standard around digital credentialing seems both necessary and elusive.

In addition, what does it mean to anchor on digital identity as a reaction to a very specific set of circumstances (namely an unprecedented global pandemic)? Digital identity systems are relevant for everything from financial services to re-skilling workforces, which each have distinct requirements. Focusing on one sector without taking a longer-term view can mean that we lose out on opportunities, duplicate efforts and create more complicated user experiences.

As it stands, there are very few regulations or industry standards to prevent fragmentation of technical solutions, protect privacy or promote inclusivity, interoperability and portability – all essential principles – for digital credentialing beyond time-sensitive use cases. As global society struggles to return to “normal,” there is a need to ensure potential solutions that embrace the use of digital credentials, leverage the experience of the digital identity community, consider a longer-term and holistic view, and create strong partnerships with public authorities.

Institutional adoption

Last year was the year of “institutional investment” in bitcoin – a buzzy phrase that was seen across pundit analyses of the crypto rallies, referring to large-scale investments of players such as MassMutual and Square (SQ). It is likely that financial institutions and service providers will intensify their own experiments with, and use of, cryptocurrency this year, whether via investment or actual deployment.

In some instances, they are also being used for improving internal processes. For example, in a Davos agenda panel Hikmet Ersek, CEO of Western Union, cited the company’s use of a stable “WU Coin” to exchange different currencies, done “21 times every second.”

COVID-19 also raised the profile of the conversation around central bank digital currencies’ exploration of blockchain technology. We saw the launch of some of the first national-level blockchain-based systems, including in the Bahamas and Cambodia. At the same time, progress around China’s DCEP (Digital Currency/Electronic Payment) continued in the background, with the People’s Bank of China having completed pilots in Shenzhen, Xiong’an and Suzhou, processing RMB 1.1 billion across 3.1 million transactions.

Still, many governments and central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, continue to research whether central bank digital currencies (CBDC) hold potential but have maintained they do not see value in issuing one at this time. Many are also watching the growth in the stablecoin space – with total value now surpassing $25 billion – fueled by decentralized finance (DeFi) and institutional interest. This has corresponded with increased attention from regulators, for instance the controversial STABLE Act in the U.S. and the recent letter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. We can expect continued regulatory interest and activity in this area from around the world.

NFTs boost inclusive wealth

We have come a long way since CryptoKitties, yet relatively little progress has been made in realizing the potential of non-fungible tokens (a cryptocurrency token that is indivisible and unique) outside of the gaming context.

But we are already seeing shifts around the dialogue of inclusion. Previously, there was talk of democratizing access to high-value assets, such as art. While there still might be potential here, it’s important to consider the implications for creators as well. For instance, some have spotlighted black artists and the role that crypto art can play in allowing for greater ownership and wealth creation within the space, as well as art exchanges. We’ve also seen early signs of how this may translate to music or writing.

Decentralized infrastructure

Awareness of the power that centralized platforms and service providers wield over our lives is moving beyond the crypto and blockchain community to the mainstream. Take, for example, the recent mass exodus from WhatsApp to Signal following a (relatively minor) change in Facebook’s data-sharing policies.

This may create an increase in demand for decentralized service provision. In 2020, we saw the highly anticipated launch of Filecoin from Protocol Labs and continued growth of Web 3.0 projects such as Keep, Oasis and Polkadot. The public cloud market is among the most highly concentrated in existence, with four providers controlling 80% of the market. Decentralized cloud storage is currently the only alternative that could pose a challenge to this status quo. Along with advances in AI, this transition could lead to significant expansion of the scope of human and machine interaction, and an acceleration of the transition to Web 3.0.

Even as we have been wrestling with the consequences of the greatest social and economic disruption of our lifetimes, the pace of work across the blockchain ecosystem has been accelerating. The great news is that awareness of the potential of decentralized systems now lives beyond the minds of a tiny minority and is slowly gaining awareness among a larger audience (although the bitcoin price index remains the biggest reason most people pay any attention to the space).","['trends', 'sheila', 'solutions', 'global', 'digital', 'continue', 'warren', 'identity', 'decentralized', 'crypto', 'potential', 'watching', 'blockchain', 'im', 'currencies']","Renewed interest in, and conversations around, blockchain technology and digital currencies from industry and government leaders have accompanied the rise.

The vote went live on the web app Snapshot on Jan. 28 and ended today at 18:00 UTC (1 p.m. ET).

Yearn Finance is a collectively designed robo-advisor for yield that is fast becoming a portal into all of DeFi. It’s governed by the token YFI, which is worth slightly more than $30,000, as of this writing.

There’s a total of 30,000 YFI in existence, per the project’s original “fair launch.” If the new tokens were minted right now and had no impact on the market capitalization, then one would expect the value of YFI to drop to something like $25,000 (meaning the new tokens would be worth $167 million), but these things are not predictable.

The final vote to increase the supply was 1,670 YFI for versus 331 against.

To participate in a vote, YFI holders have to stake to the governance contract in advance of a vote by a specified Ethereum block number. The total amount of YFI staked to vote on YIP-57 was 4,089.

Final changes are approved by six of the nine members of the Yearn multisig, which is something like the DeFi equivalent of a board of directors.

Under the proposal, 33% of the new tokens would be set aside for key contributors. Which contributors the allocation would be for and how much each would get is unknown. There will be some sort of staking set up so contributors only get their allocations for sticking around, but none of that has been decided.

The other 66% will be set aside as a treasury, for everything from protocol acquisition to further development.

The decision marks a clear shift for the team, which accrued a unique amount of buzz for eschewing the convention of setting aside governance tokens for insiders.

The authors of the newly passed proposal wrote:

""Yearn's launch was exceptional at creating a decentralized and engaged community, but it did not provide adequate incentives to retain existing and future contributors on an ongoing basis, nor did it provide the protocol with a war chest to fund future activities.""

The community remains somewhat divided on the initiative. As the vote indicates, though, most YFI holders are for it.

On the supporter side, user zkwaffles wrote:

""This seems to be the equivalent of an equity raising round. In these rounds an early-stage venture will issue equity and in effect dilute current shareholders. ... The overarching idea being that the cash raised will increase future value enough to offset any dilution.""

On the opposition, user laur_science argued the proposal wasn’t specific enough:

""I don't like it, so I voted against. It doesn't even specify what type of vesting we're talking about. I want it to be for 5 years, equal amounts per year.""","['20', 'yfi', 'set', 'future', 'defi', 'supply', 'yearn', 'finance', 'votes', 'proposal', 'community', 'vote', 'token', 'inflate', 'contributors', 'tokens']","The Yearn Finance community has been discussing expanding the supply of YFI as a way to compensate the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform’s de facto staffers.
Yearn Finance is a collectively designed robo-advisor for yield that is fast becoming a portal into all of DeFi.
It’s governed by the token YFI, which is worth slightly more than $30,000, as of this writing.
The final vote to increase the supply was 1,670 YFI for versus 331 against.

Balancer, a non-custodial portfolio manager, is releasing version 2.0, which puts all the assets entrusted to it in one big vault. This should dramatically reduce gas fees for decentralized finance (DeFi) trades because users can swap as much as they want, only paying gas for going into and out of Balancer.

The team had considered building it this way from the start but decided initially to be conservative and separate out each pool for added security, CEO Fernando Martinelli told CoinDesk.

“We are today … comfortable enough with having a big vault that holds a lot of money. We put a lot of effort into making this as safe as if the assets were siloed,” he wrote in an email. “Many other protocols (not AMMs) already do this: lending protocols, collateral in MakerDAO, etc.”

Balancer works much like (and can serve the function of) an automated market maker (AMM) like Uniswap or Curve but it allows users to create pools of multiple tokens, weighted as they see fit. The pools automatically rebalance as needed in order to stay in line with the market.

This requires making a lot of transactions, which in turn require a lot of Ethereum gas fees. That is not capital-efficient for traders nor for liquidity pool providers, especially as gas prices tick upward.

In this new version, the accounting for those pools will just be done in smart contracts separate from the big custody pool.

One big pool

With Balancer v2, no matter how complex a trade or trades, “only the final net token amounts are transferred from and to the vault, saving a significant amount of gas in the process,” Martinelli wrote in an announcement post. Balancer can keep track of all of the assets entrusted to it in one vault and just move allocations around on people’s accounts.

“Now, token management and accounting is done by the vault while the AMM logic is individual to each pool. Because pools are contracts external to the vault, they can implement any arbitrary, customized AMM logic,” the team wrote.

In fact, the new version will even take it a step further. Active traders can set up an individual account so they can make lots of trades. Then they will only be charged gas fees when they want to withdraw.

Of course, that may sound more like a centralized exchange to some traders, which is somewhat fair. The key difference here is it’s all being kept on smart contracts that can be reviewed by the public; and, as an Ethereum project, its functionality can be easily integrated into others.

It does raise a security concern. To oversimplify it, think of it this way: If someone had a large treasure of gold, it would be trickier to steal it all if it were locked away in multiple vaults in different places rather than one big vault.

Martinelli does not dispute this, but he also notes that the more-complex logic in Balancer doesn’t touch the assets, which should be reassuring.

“Since the operations the vault will be doing are very low-level (add to a user balance, remove from a pool the user traded with), we will make everything (including formal verification) to make sure the vault is safe and sound,” Martinelli said via email.

Other developments

Balancer is adding some other features in version 2.0 that may be of interest to more advanced users. Crucially, it wants to make it easier to experiment with composition pools.

“Balancer v2 pioneers customizable AMM logic: [I]t effectively creates a launch pad for teams to innovate with different AMM strategies without having to worry about low level token transfers, balance accounting, security checks [and] smart order routing,” the announcement says.

It will go live with the familiar weighted pools that Balancer users know already. It will also have stable pools that work more as Curve does, so big trades on stablecoins can see very little slippage. Soon, Balancer will launch smart pools, whose logic can change on the fly.

Balancer will also introduce asset managers, external smart contracts that can be used to put some of a liquidity pools’ underlying value to work elsewhere in DeFi. This should be good for liquidity providers, because as the team notes, “in normal trading conditions, most of the assets in an AMM are not actually used.”

Balancer will also introduce trading fees that can be controlled by holders of its BAL token. It will offer fees on trades, withdrawals and flash loans. Only the final fee will be active at the start of version 2.0, however. BAL holders can use the fees either to pay for further development, for a dividend or some combination of both.

Balancer was one of the earliest projects to join the liquidity mining craze this summer, launching BAL distributions to users shortly after COMP distributions went live. Like on Compound, BAL liquidity mining has never stopped.

“We are currently discussing with the community some interesting updates to BAL liquidity mining. It will certainly continue though: it’s our main way to make sure we have a diverse and engaged governance,” Martinelli noted.","['liquidity', 'amm', 'big', 'vault', 'transactions', 'cuts', 'balancers', 'balancer', 'pool', 'pools', 'users', 'gas', 'fees', 'version']","Balancer, a non-custodial portfolio manager, is releasing version 2.0, which puts all the assets entrusted to it in one big vault.

In light of Robinhood’s disabling of buying in a number of stocks, there is a lot of fury about potential conflicts of interest that are not new but now suddenly in the spotlight.

The situation emphasizes the need for transparency in markets and why certain marketing that appears beneficial – “Trade stocks for free!” – may have deleterious characteristics under some circumstances.

Matthew Trudeau, chief Operating Officer at ErisX, has participated in the successful launch of 12 electronic trading venues. Prior to ErisX, Matthew was most recently co-founder and president of Tradewind Markets, an electronic trading platform and blockchain-based post trade system for physical precious metals.

In a practice known as “payment for order flow,” or PFOF, brokers sell their clients’ order flow to professional trading firms called “internalizers.” This practice has been covered by the media many times over the years, more recently by Institutional Investor and MSN. Brokers send individual investors’ orders, e.g., to buy stock in GameStop, to the internalizers that pay to trade against this “dumb flow.” The internalizers then net-offset the retail trades, keeping the spread, or offset trades on the national stock exchanges, presumably at a profit that exceeds the cost of their payments made to Robinhood and other retail brokers. The majority of retail equities orders never execute on an actual stock exchange.

So, retail traders trade for “free” and the brokers and professional internalizers still make lots of money. Not all market makers support PFOF. The question retail traders should be asking is, how much in hidden fees are they paying? If the non-transparent markups, spreads, or opportunity costs are greater than an explicit and transparent trade commission, then “free” may be pretty misleading. How fees and conflicts are disclosed and managed, or not, is pretty important. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seems to agree.

Well, good thing this only happens in equity trading. Crypto must be free of these conflicts, right?

Not exactly.

There is a lot of lip service paid to “democratizing access.” Call us fundamentalists, but when we envision a “democratized market” we envision an exchange where all members can trade with all other members according to a common set of rules and standards.

If the non-transparent markups, spreads or opportunity costs are greater than an explicit and transparent trade commission, then 'free' may be pretty misleading.

It’s a market where price discovery and liquidity are available to all on equal terms, and where the commingling of order flows from many different participants with diverse market outlooks and time horizons produce a better market quality. A central limit order book (CLOB), the model most typically found on regulated futures and stock exchanges such as the CME and Nasdaq, provides such a market structure (as we discussed here and here). On a CLOB, with a published price schedule and displayed quotations, the full cost of a trade is explicit and transparent: the price at which investors can purchase or sell a quantity of an asset plus the transaction fee. It is really pretty simple.

It does not strike us as very “democratic” when order flow gets channeled to exclusive liquidity providers that gain an informational advantage as a result of that exclusivity, particularly where that conflict is not well disclosed. Almost without fail, if a trading or pricing arrangement is not fully transparent there is, at worst, a problem or conflict. Or, as may be the case with unregulated/offshore markets, something untoward may be happening. At best there is an arrangement the parties would rather keep quiet from their products, er, customers.

As a new asset, crypto has had the opportunity to learn from the market structure examples of traditional markets. Unfortunately, some of the lessons that have ported over are sub-optimal arrangements rather than best practices.

An apparently significant part of the crypto market structure involves brokers sending client orders to over-the-counter “trading venues,” in that model a synonym for internalizing dealers. Or, in some cases, the broker is the dealer. (It is worth noting that in traditional markets there are strict rules that generally prohibit or restrict exchanges and brokers trading against their own clients.) OTC liquidity provision is a variation on the PFOF model. Instead of all-to-all trading with the explicit and transparent fees CLOBs enable, the OTC liquidity model replicates the implicit costs, informational advantages, opacity and potential conflicts of interest that have been problematic in equities and FX trading.

The Robinhood saga also exposes another risk of the exclusive liquidity provider model: counterparty risk. There has been a lot of speculation about why Robinhood disabled the buying of certain stocks. We will not wade into that discussion, but it does beg the question of what happens when the liquidity providers cannot or will not provide the liquidity, or cannot or will not settle trades. A CLOB diversifies counterparties and a clearinghouse eliminates settlement risk. These are proven market infrastructures that were designed in response to past market failures and disruptions.","['liquidity', 'trade', 'market', 'brokers', 'matthew', 'trading', 'transparent', 'retail', 'model', 'crypto', 'arent', 'alltoall', 'trudeau', 'markets', 'order']","Matthew Trudeau, chief Operating Officer at ErisX, has participated in the successful launch of 12 electronic trading venues.

“We think one of the biggest problems that need to be tackled exists on decentralized exchanges,” said Shumo Chu, CEO and co-founder of Manta Network, in an email.

“The volume is large and increasing on decentralized exchanges, but DEXs are also a hotbed for front-running opportunities due to the transparent nature of the blockchain. Someone can see your transaction before it gets written and confirmed, and make the same transaction with a higher fee to get priority and pass that transaction before you do.”

Privacy in DeFi

According to the survey, nearly three-quarters of the 404 respondents (73.2%) “have either hesitated or completely avoided making a transaction in the past because they were worried about the privacy implications of that transaction.”

Additionally, 84% of respondents expressed concern about their wallet addresses being linked to their real identity. Part of this concern was caused due to the fact that the nature of blockchains allows people to see address balances.

In fact, over 90% of survey respondents said they’d looked up someone’s wallet address to view that person’s holdings and/or transactions.

The survey adds further weight to the notion that privacy is a central concern in the cryptocurrency space, and the Manta Network is one of a number of different projects in the DeFi space working to increase privacy functionality.

The Manta Network

The Manta Network aims to bolster privacy in DeFi, in part, by obfuscating wallet addresses, but with the overall aim of letting users transact and exchange privacy. A parachain in the Polkadot ecosystem, Manta Network’s first major project is a privacy-preserving automated market maker (AMM) DEX called MantaSwap.

Subscribe to , By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms & conditions and privacy policy

The Manta Network is working to implement ZkSNARKs on the blockchain level. ZkSNARKs are a cryptographic technique that allows two entities to verify information with each other without having to share the underlying data related to it.

Think about it in the context of logging into a website, for example. The site verifies who you are without sharing your password, geolocation data or other information that can be used to figure out additional details about yourself that you aren’t aware you might be giving up.

According to Chu, Manta’s use of ZkSNARKS can bring privacy to transactions and user identity.

“While you are still able to monitor your own transactions, no one else can do so anymore,” he said. “By taking this and applying it in an interoperable manner (through Polkadot), we’re able to provide a plug-and-play solution for the entire ecosystem in the future.”

Right now though, Chu said the team is focusing on enhancing usability, given their goal is to be a plug-and-play solution. Additionally, they’re working to ensure transparency of both the code itself as well as the process.

“As part of the usability, we also want to focus on the security of the implementation, which takes time,” he said.

Why privacy matters

The implications for transparent transactions aren’t limited to someone knowing how much money is in an address. It can have tangible downstream effects, given that information is power.

In traditional finance, if you want to view your bank account information (including transactions and total cash), you have to prove that you are the owner of that account. No one else is allowed to view your information without your consent.

“It’s different on the blockchain – anyone who knows your wallet address can review your transactions, trace your transactions and see all of your assets,” said Chu.

Chu said that lack of privacy leads to a host of other issues that arise in scaling out blockchain use cases. Automated monitoring and scraping leads to unauthorized data collection, opening up potential opportunities for blackmail. In corporate use cases, trade secrets may be revealed by tracing transactions on chain.

On decentralized exchanges, that transparency leads to front-running opportunities, according to Chu. People are taking extra steps, which increases the friction of usage, just to make transactions more obfuscated.

Chu said the availability of privacy products are a secondary issue on DEXs, which is part of the reason he said he wants Manta Network to be plug and play.

“Future DEX projects don’t need to bring onboard their own cryptography team; they can use our development tools,” he said. “Other DeFi projects and general blockchain projects can do the same thing.”

Funding and the future

The Manta Network, which was previously a Web 3.0 Foundation Grant winner, closed a $1.1 million funding round, led by Polychain Capital, to build MantaSwap.

“Manta Network brings an experienced team to tackle the critical and growing issues regarding privacy on the blockchain,” said Ben Perszyk, partner at Polychain, in a statement. “Its unique approach to building as a Polkadot parachain enables them to offer plug-and-play privacy to a multitude of use cases and projects, starting with their own privacy-preserving DEX.”

The funding will jump-start Manta Network’s development. The team is currently finishing its prototype to deliver to the Web3 Foundation. Before the end of Q1, it will be delivering the first version of its test net. In future releases of the test net, it will introduce other assets as well as exchange functionality.","['network', 'privacy', 'defi', 'wallet', 'information', 'transactions', 'getting', 'projects', 'transaction', 'boost', 'blockchain', 'team', 'manta']","A new survey by Manta Network, a privacy-preserving decentralized finance stack built on Substrate, has shed further light on the need for privacy in the rapidly expanding DeFi space.

[],,https://static.coindesk.com/static/chunks/images/facebook-cd851abcf9cbd3f39aaafc2c0a54009d.png,"In order to mine Ethereum, you need specialized computers that can perform the computations necessary to create new tokens on the blockchain in a timely manner as well as a significant amount of electricity, which is required to run the equipment continuously. All of this adds up to significant upfront costs.

Mining is the “glue” that holds together many cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, by ensuring that the network comes to consensus on each and every change made in the system. Ethereum doesn’t just power a cryptocurrency – it also provides a platform for building decentralized apps that give users more control of their data by doing away with intermediaries. Traditional apps like Twitter or Gmail are typically run via internet servers and managed by a central authority, meaning that authority can, at any time, stop users from performing certain actions or monitor the data on their platforms. Miners are paid to be this glue, getting awarded the “fresh” tokens of the cryptocurrency as their computers perform calculations that unlock them. That’s why most people take up the venture in the first place.

Miners set computers loose to grind through cryptographic computations in an attempt to win ether, Ethereum’s native token. They need to try a huge number of computational problems until one unlocks a new batch of the asset.

In theory, anyone can set their computers to focus on these cryptographic puzzles as a way to win rewards. The catch is that mining on major public blockchains tends to require more and more power over time. As more people invest in more powerful hardware to mine cryptocurrency, the calculations get harder. Miners using regular computers are very, very unlikely to win.

Choosing mining hardware

Before getting started, you will need special computer hardware to dedicate full-time to mining.

There are three types of mining hardware:

CPUs

GPUs: Faster than CPUs

ASICs: Even faster and more powerful than GPUs

GPUs and ASICs boast a higher hashrate, meaning they can guess puzzle answers more quickly. At time of writing, GPUs and ASICs are now the only cost-effective option for ether miners. CPUs aren’t powerful enough anymore.

Settling up a GPU is a complex task and you can browse plenty of advice about which ones are the most profitable based on how many hashes the GPU can compute per second, power consumption and the initial expense of the card.

You probably want to set up a mining rig, a machine that might be composed of multiple GPUs and can take a week to build.Online mining profitability calculators, such as the one offered by Etherscan, give some insight into the likely amount of ether you’ll earn at a given hashrate, and whether that ether is enough – when cutting out the costs of setup and electricity – to make a profit.

Installing Ethereum software

After selecting some mining hardware, the next step is to install the mining software.

Miners need to install an Ethereum client to connect to the wider Ethereum network. An internet connection is vital for miners. Without an internet connection, the node won’t be able to do much of anything.

Programmers familiar with the command line can install Geth, software that runs an Ethereum node written in the scripting language Go, or any of the other Ethereum clients, like Parity or OpenEthereum.

Download Geth here, using the directions for your appropriate operating system (Windows, Mac OS, or Linux), unzip it, and run it.

Once installed, your node can then connect to the Ethereum network where it can then “talk” to other nodes, to catch wind of the latest transactions and blocks. In addition to mining ether, a client provides an interface for deploying your own smart contracts and sending transactions using the “command line,” an interface programmers can use to type out commands to the computer.

Install Ethereum mining software

Aspiring miners then need to install the official mining software, Ethminer.

Find the download for the appropriate version of Windows here, or GPU mining instructions for other operating systems here.

Once installed, your node will officially play a part in securing the Ethereum network. For more detailed instructions on any of the above, visit the official ethereum website.

Joining a mining pool

As a miner, you’re unlikely to be able to mine ether on your own.

That’s why miners “pool” together their computational power into “mining pools,” to improve their chances of solving the cryptographic puzzles and earning ether. Then, they split the profits proportional to how much power each miner contributed.

There are many factors involved in joining a mining pool. Each pool might not be around forever, and the computational power of each pool is constantly changing, so there are a number of factors that go into deciding which to join.

One point to keep in mind is that mining pools have different payout structures. And pools charge mining fees.

Today the most popular mining pools are:

Ethermine

F2Pool

Sparkpool

Nanopool

The distribution of Ethereum mining pools as of Jan. 7, 2021. (Etherscan.io)

Mining pools generally have a signup process on their website so miners can connect to the pool and begin mining.

Find cheap electricity

The other biggest mining cost is electricity. Many profitable miners scout for electricity discounts, either by moving to regions around the world with less expensive electricity or by tapping renewable energy sources.

Ethereum Mining FAQs

Is Ethereum mining profitable?

The answer is complex. There are many variables miners need to consider when taking the plunge into mining, such as how much ether is worth at a given time and cost of electricity, an expensive necessity for mining. The cost of electricity varies across the globe.

How could the Ethereum upgrade ‘ProgPoW’ impact mining?

ProgPoW is a proposed Ethereum upgrade that, if implemented, would hamstring the most powerful miners. The motive for doing so is to keep the network decentralized by trying to ensure that no one in the network gets too much power.

In short, miners using ASICs (hardware even more powerful for mining than GPUs – see above) are the ones that would be affected. Their ASICs, which miners likely paid a premium for, would no longer be able to be used to mine ether.

How will Ethereum 2.0 upgrade impact mining?

The upgrade Ethereum 2.0 started roll out on Dec. 1, 2020, and will be iterated upon over the next several years.

The upgrade will impact mining even more drastically than ProgPoW. Once Ethereum 2.0 is fully rolled out, the goal is to eradicate miners completely, paving the way for a more energy-efficient method of maintaining the integrity of the Ethereum blockchain.

How do I keep abreast of Ethereum events that could impact mining?

The mining world is a whirlwind of change. The tools that you pick up today might be obsolete next year. Some mining pools might fall away while others emerge.

As a miner it’s worth keeping aware of industry shifts by keeping tabs on the latest mining news as well as Ethereum protocol upgrades.","['101', 'network', 'ethereum', 'mining', 'need', 'pools', 'miners', 'upgrade', 'electricity', 'ether', 'power']","Miners need to install an Ethereum client to connect to the wider Ethereum network.

Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao – who earned the number-one spot on CoinDesk’s 2018 Most Influential list – Binance rose to prominence during the historic crypto market-wide bull run in 2017 by supporting a wide array of cryptocurrencies in what was, and perhaps still is, one of the fastest and most reliable trading platforms.

In fact, Binance became so popular, so quickly that CZ and Binance both became worth more than $1 billion in less than one year, officially making it one of the first companies to achieve “unicorn” status in the cryptocurrency industry.

Yet despite its reputation as a destination for crypto traders, it’s not exactly easy for users who lack a traditional trading or investment background to navigate their way around.

In this piece, we take a step-by-step look at how to use Binance and conduct a trade on the exchange.

Signing up

First thing’s first, you’ll need to create an account. Anyone is able to sign up since Binance does not require customer information, but by doing so “you acknowledge and declare that you are not on any trade or economic sanctions lists” as per its Terms of Use.

This includes citizens of the member countries in the UN Security Council Sanctions list, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC), among other groups.

The terms also state each user must be at least 18 years of age. Binance reserves the right to cancel or freeze any account If the terms are disobeyed.

If the restrictions do not apply to you, to sign up simply navigate to the homepage and click register.

You will then be asked to enter a minimal amount of personal information such as your email address, password, and a referral ID if you have one.

As per Binance’s referral system, you will receive 50 percent of your referrals trading fees.

After you fill in the required fields, click “Register” and complete the captcha, a confirmation link will be sent to your email address.

Once the link is clicked, your Binance account is ready to be used.

Deposit Funds

Now that your account is activated, but before exploring the rest of the exchange, you’ll need to add funds to your account if you wish to buy or sell any cryptocurrencies.

Pay with credit card

Binance has a feature that allows users to purchase certain cryptocurrencies directly with their Visa or Mastercard credit card. If you are a qualified candidate, navigate to the “Funds” tab and select “Buy With Credit Card.”

You will then be required to enter the purchase amount of the desired cryptocurrency and whether you will be paying with the US dollar or euro. Cryptocurrency purchases by credit card are limited to BTC, ETH, and LTC at this time.

There is a minimum processing fee of $10 or 3.5 percent of the total order – whichever is more expensive. After completing this step, you will need to confirm your billing information, email address as well as your identity.

A valid government issued form of ID is required to be submitted to confirm your identity.

Once all of the required steps have been completed, the newly purchased cryptocurrency should reach your Binance wallet within 10-30 minutes.

Deposit from wallet

You can also make a deposit by sending funds from a separate cryptocurrency wallet into your Binance account.

In order to do this, navigate to the “Funds” tab once again and click “Balances.”

On this page, you will see all of the cryptocurrencies available for trading on Binance. To deposit the corresponding crypto into any of these, simply click the “Deposit” button next to the crypto asset of your choice.

Next, either scan the QR code from your cryptocurrency wallet or paste in the address and then send.

Once that’s complete, wait for the transaction to process and you’ll be ready for trading.

Placing a trade

Let’s go back to the home page now that your funds are ready to be used.

Here, you will again see all the cryptocurrencies that are tradable on Binance and their respective markets.

For this example, let’s say you previously deposited 0.0024 BTC (~$10) into your account and now wish to trade it for NEO.

First, you’ll need to find the right NEO market.

Since you want to spend BTC in order to get NEO, click the “BTC Markets” tab and then type NEO into the search bar.

Click the appropriate row and the page where trading takes place will open.

Trading module

This page may look intimidating, but you can easily get the hang of it with a bit of practice.

Plus, most cryptocurrency exchanges have a similar trading interface so what you remember here, in all likelihood, will be relevant elsewhere.

The left section of the screen is known as an order book.

Here, you will see all active buy and sell limit orders. A limit order is simply an order that will only be placed at the user’s desired price, given there are buyers or sellers interested at that level.

If you would like to learn the “in’s and out’s” of an order book, check out our comprehensive guide, but for now all you need to know is that the top of the order book (red) is where the limit sell orders wait to be filled and the bottom section (green) is where the limit buy orders wait to be filled.

The right side of the page is more simple – the above section shows the other cryptocurrencies that can be traded and the lower section shows the public trade history of the market currently being viewed.

Trade example: Buying NEO

The center of the page is where the real magic happens.

Here lays a chart feature that shows real-time price action and technical analysis indicators. Just below the chart is where you will actually execute the trade, so let’s buy some NEO.

If certainty of execution is your priority, select market order. If you are interested in only buying at a specific price level, select either limit or stop-limit order.

For the purposes of this example, let’s place a market order, which will be placed immediately at current market prices.

Now, just enter the amount of BTC desired to be spent and how much NEO you want to purchase. Binance has a useful shortcut for entering the purchase amount and it is based on a percentage of your bitcoin balance (or any other appropriate trading pair).

Let’s spend 50 percent of the BTC balance so there is some left over, perhaps for another trade.

The last step is to click the big green button “Buy NEO.” Since this is a market order, the trade for 0.58 NEO should have completed instantly, but that is most likely not the case if you selected limit or stop-limit order.

To check on the status of your order, look towards the bottom of the page where it says “Open order.” As the title would suggest, if your order has not yet executed, in other words, is still “open,” it will appear in this box until it has either been canceled or filled.

When it has been filled, it will show up in the lower box highlighting your 24-hour order history, just as how this order has below.

In order to sell, simply follow this same process but execute a market or limit sell order.

Withdrawing funds

While Binance does have a decentralized exchange in the works, the existing platform is centralized and susceptible to hacks like many other websites, so it’s recommended funds are only held on the exchange for as long as necessary.

In order to withdraw, navigate back to the “Balances” page. If you would like to see only the cryptocurrencies you have a substantial balance in, check the “hide” box.

Now select the withdrawal button in the NEO row and have your destination address or QR code handy. Paste the address and select how much you want to withdraw.

Last but not least, click submit and wait for the transaction to complete.

Binance Launchpad

The Binance Launchpad is a token launch platform exclusive to Binance and plans to offer token sales for new projects.

Binance handpicks which tokens to launch based on a number of factors including project maturity, scalability and adoption readiness, team quality and the ability of the project to benefit the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

To ensure the sales are being conducted in compliance with regulatory regimes around the world, each user must verify his or her Binance account.

Completed token sales, as well as those scheduled for a future date, can be seen on the home page of the Binance Launchpad. It’s worth noting that the token sales operate on a “first come, first serve” basis and usually sell out in just minutes, so be sure to do your due diligence.

If you successfully participate in a Launchpad token sale, the tokens will be automatically credited to your Binance account.

Security

Like most modern cryptocurrency exchanges, two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled on Binance and is highly recommended to be set up in order to add an extra layer of protection to your account.

In order to do so, navigate to your account summary by clicking the user avatar in the top right of the home page.

Once directed to your account page, a prompt will likely appear suggesting you to enable 2FA, which happens to automatically pops up when a new user accesses this page.

Binance allows two methods for enabling 2FA, via SMS or Google Authenticator.

With the SMS version, simply enter your mobile phone number and the verification code sent to the corresponding phone and you will be all set.

If Google Authenticator is your 2FA of choice, download the mobile application, open it and scan the QR code provided by Binance. Next, you will be asked to write down a 16-word recovery phrase to be used as a backup in case you lose access to this google authentication.

Lastly, you will be prompted to enter your account’s login password and the authenticator code found in the Google Authenticator mobile app. Once complete, this form of 2FA security will be complete.

Pros and Cons

First thing’s first, you’ll need to create an account. Anyone is able to sign up since Binance does not require customer information, but by doing so “you acknowledge and declare that you are not on any trade or economic sanctions lists” as per its Terms of Use.

This includes citizens of the member countries in the UN Security Council Sanctions list, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC), among other groups.

The terms also state each user must be at least 18 years of age. Binance reserves the right to cancel or freeze any account If the terms are disobeyed.

If the restrictions do not apply to you, to sign up simply navigate to the homepage and click register.

You will then be asked to enter a minimal amount of personal information such as your email address, password, and a referral ID if you have one.

As per Binance’s referral system, you will receive 50 percent of your referrals trading fees.

After you fill in the required fields, click “Register” and complete the captcha, a confirmation link will be sent to your email address.

Once the link is clicked, your Binance account is ready to be used.

Deposit Funds

Now that your account is activated, but before exploring the rest of the exchange, you’ll need to add funds to your account if you wish to buy or sell any cryptocurrencies.

Pay with credit card

Binance has a feature that allows users to purchase certain cryptocurrencies directly with their Visa or Mastercard credit card. If you are a qualified candidate, navigate to the “Funds” tab and select “Buy With Credit Card.”

You will then be required to enter the purchase amount of the desired cryptocurrency and whether you will be paying with the US dollar or euro. Cryptocurrency purchases by credit card are limited to BTC, ETH, and LTC at this time.

There is a minimum processing fee of $10 or 3.5 percent of the total order – whichever is more expensive. After completing this step, you will need to confirm your billing information, email address as well as your identity.

A valid government issued form of ID is required to be submitted to confirm your identity.

Once all of the required steps have been completed, the newly purchased cryptocurrency should reach your Binance wallet within 10-30 minutes.

Deposit from wallet

You can also make a deposit by sending funds from a separate cryptocurrency wallet into your Binance account.

In order to do this, navigate to the “Funds” tab once again and click “Balances.”

On this page, you will see all of the cryptocurrencies available for trading on Binance. To deposit the corresponding crypto into any of these, simply click the “Deposit” button next to the crypto asset of your choice.

Next, either scan the QR code from your cryptocurrency wallet or paste in the address and then send.

Once that’s complete, wait for the transaction to process and you’ll be ready for trading.

Placing a trade

Let’s go back to the home page now that your funds are ready to be used.

Here, you will again see all the cryptocurrencies that are tradable on Binance and their respective markets.

For this example, let’s say you previously deposited 0.0024 BTC (~$10) into your account and now wish to trade it for NEO.

First, you’ll need to find the right NEO market.

Since you want to spend BTC in order to get NEO, click the “BTC Markets” tab and then type NEO into the search bar.

Click the appropriate row and the page where trading takes place will open.

Trading module

This page may look intimidating, but you can easily get the hang of it with a bit of practice.

Plus, most cryptocurrency exchanges have a similar trading interface so what you remember here, in all likelihood, will be relevant elsewhere.

The left section of the screen is known as an order book.

Here, you will see all active buy and sell limit orders. A limit order is simply an order that will only be placed at the user’s desired price, given there are buyers or sellers interested at that level.

If you would like to learn the “in’s and out’s” of an order book, check out our comprehensive guide, but for now all you need to know is that the top of the order book (red) is where the limit sell orders wait to be filled and the bottom section (green) is where the limit buy orders wait to be filled.

The right side of the page is more simple – the above section shows the other cryptocurrencies that can be traded and the lower section shows the public trade history of the market currently being viewed.

Trade example: Buying NEO

The center of the page is where the real magic happens.

Here lays a chart feature that shows real-time price action and technical analysis indicators. Just below the chart is where you will actually execute the trade, so let’s buy some NEO.

If certainty of execution is your priority, select market order. If you are interested in only buying at a specific price level, select either limit or stop-limit order.

For the purposes of this example, let’s place a market order, which will be placed immediately at current market prices.

Now, just enter the amount of BTC desired to be spent and how much NEO you want to purchase. Binance has a useful shortcut for entering the purchase amount and it is based on a percentage of your bitcoin balance (or any other appropriate trading pair).

Let’s spend 50 percent of the BTC balance so there is some left over, perhaps for another trade.

The last step is to click the big green button “Buy NEO.” Since this is a market order, the trade for 0.58 NEO should have completed instantly, but that is most likely not the case if you selected limit or stop-limit order.

To check on the status of your order, look towards the bottom of the page where it says “Open order.” As the title would suggest, if your order has not yet executed, in other words, is still “open,” it will appear in this box until it has either been canceled or filled.

When it has been filled, it will show up in the lower box highlighting your 24-hour order history, just as how this order has below.

In order to sell, simply follow this same process but execute a market or limit sell order.

Withdrawing funds

While Binance does have a decentralized exchange in the works, the existing platform is centralized and susceptible to hacks like many other websites, so it’s recommended funds are only held on the exchange for as long as necessary.

In order to withdraw, navigate back to the “Balances” page. If you would like to see only the cryptocurrencies you have a substantial balance in, check the “hide” box.

Now select the withdrawal button in the NEO row and have your destination address or QR code handy. Paste the address and select how much you want to withdraw.

Last but not least, click submit and wait for the transaction to complete.

Binance Launchpad

The Binance Launchpad is a token launch platform exclusive to Binance and plans to offer token sales for new projects.

Binance handpicks which tokens to launch based on a number of factors including project maturity, scalability and adoption readiness, team quality and the ability of the project to benefit the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

To ensure the sales are being conducted in compliance with regulatory regimes around the world, each user must verify his or her Binance account.

Completed token sales, as well as those scheduled for a future date, can be seen on the home page of the Binance Launchpad. It’s worth noting that the token sales operate on a “first come, first serve” basis and usually sell out in just minutes, so be sure to do your due diligence.

If you successfully participate in a Launchpad token sale, the tokens will be automatically credited to your Binance account.

Security

Like most modern cryptocurrency exchanges, two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled on Binance and is highly recommended to be set up in order to add an extra layer of protection to your account.

In order to do so, navigate to your account summary by clicking the user avatar in the top right of the home page.

Once directed to your account page, a prompt will likely appear suggesting you to enable 2FA, which happens to automatically pops up when a new user accesses this page.

Binance allows two methods for enabling 2FA, via SMS or Google Authenticator.

With the SMS version, simply enter your mobile phone number and the verification code sent to the corresponding phone and you will be all set.

If Google Authenticator is your 2FA of choice, download the mobile application, open it and scan the QR code provided by Binance. Next, you will be asked to write down a 16-word recovery phrase to be used as a backup in case you lose access to this google authentication.

Lastly, you will be prompted to enter your account’s login password and the authenticator code found in the Google Authenticator mobile app. Once complete, this form of 2FA security will be complete.

Pros and Cons

Pros

If you're constantly on the go, Binance’s mobile application may be perfect for you. It's compatible with iOS, Android, as well as Mac and PC operating systems so just about anyone can place a trade or monitor their account from virtually anywhere.

Binance offers a large selection of tradeable cryptocurrency markets. As of May 1, 2019, 467 different markets are supported on the exchange.

Binance has it own native exchange token, BNB, which can be used to supplement trading fees and boost the overall liquidity on Binance.

Binance was a pioneer of the Initial Exchange Offerings, and It’s Launchpad facilitates sales once a month for those who are interested in being early holders of new tokens.

Higher trading volume that most other cryptocurrency exchanges.

Cons

If following government regulations like that of the US is important to you, then you may want to try out exchanges such As Coinbase or Gemini, because at this point Binance is still an unregulated exchange.

Many of Binance’s markets, specifically those of the lesser known altcoins, offer low liquidity which can make trading large altcoin positions difficult.

Founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao – who earned the number-one spot on CoinDesk’s 2018 Most Influential list – Binance rose to prominence during the historic crypto market-wide bull run in 2017 by supporting a wide array of cryptocurrencies in what was, and perhaps still is, one of the fastest and most reliable trading platforms.

According to an excerpt from the firm’s upcoming “2021 Crypto Crime Report,” published Monday, online marketplaces providing illegal goods like drugs and fake IDs received a record-setting amount of cryptocurrency last year, equivalent to $1.7 billion. Russia, the U.S., Ukraine and China were the main areas of global money traffic to such platforms.

Darknet marketplaces receive most of their money through peer-to-peer crypto marketplaces and centralized exchanges, Chainalysis wrote. However, in 2020, the use of centralized exchanges increased, as did mixing services, which allow to obfuscate the participants in a cryptocurrency transaction.

Drug deal distribution

The report lists 10 countries where people are most actively interacting with dark markets: Russia, the U.S., Ukraine, China, the U.K., Venezuela, Vietnam, Turkey, India and Germany. Together, these nations were the source of $538 million to illicit markets during 2020 while people there received $403 million, Chainalysis said.

Russians sent around $169 million to the various darknet marketplaces, and received $119 million from such sites. Americans were second, with $115 million sent and $64 million received. In third place, Ukrainians sent $47 million and received $52 million.

“Generally speaking, drugs are grown or manufactured in Latin America and Asia and consumed in North America and Northern & Western Europe,” the report reads. “Darknet vendors and administrators typically launder funds through cryptocurrency services – often over-the-counter (OTC) brokers – in China or Eastern Europe. We can see some of this activity in the blockchain data associated with darknet market transactions.”

Dominant player

The biggest marketplace in the field by far is Hydra, a Russian-language drug marketplace that pocketed 75% of the entire global dark market revenue, Chainalysis said. Hydra was mostly responsible for the rapid growth in the global dark market revenue over the last year, while the income of other marketplaces didn’t change significantly between 2019 and 2020.

Hydra delivers drugs to buyers via “drops,” in which a delivery person hides the purchase close to a buyer and shares the geolocation of the package so it can be collected. In December 2019, Hydra announced it wanted to expand to other regions of the world and would hold a $146 million token sale. This was later put on hold due to the global coronavirus pandemic.

According to the data from Bitfury’s data firm Crystal Blockchain, currently, Hydra’s bitcoin addresses hold more than 521 BTC, worth over $18 million. Since 2011, Hydra has sent and received more than 439,000 BTC ($15.2 billion).

Data limitations

Chainalysis has been researching the various aspects of geography of cryptocurrency use for several years, although the firm admits locating such activity on the globe is a tricky task and such research has its limitations.

To see where in the world crypto markets are most active, Chainalysis looks into such data as web traffic on the particular services via SimilarWeb, time zones in which transactions take place, fiat currencies involved, languages and the location of the headquarters of the services, the firm’s head of research, Kim Grauer, told CoinDesk for a previous report on cryptocurrency adoption around the globe.","['marketplaces', 'million', 'market', 'dominate', 'report', 'global', 'services', 'russia', 'dark', 'sent', 'chainalysis', 'hydra', 'cryptocurrency', 'traffic', 'received']","People in Russia and the U.S. were the source of over $284 million to illicit online marketplaces in 2020, blockchain research firm Chainalysis said in its latest report.

In traditional markets, European and Asian shares rose and U.S. stock futures pointed toward a higher open amid renewed optimism for economic stimulus and the distribution of coronavirus vaccines. GameStop shares lost nearly a third of their value on Monday following last week’s 400% short squeeze.

Silver, whose price had shot up to an eight-year high after a series of posts on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum calling for a “short squeeze,” tumbled as some commenters pushed back against the narrative; precious-metals analysts for the lenders HSBC and Commerzbank warned the rally would be hard to sustain. Gold weakened 0.6% to $1,849 an ounce.

Market Moves

With the coronavirus vaccine distribution well underway, Wall Street analysts are sketching out what the economy might look like as 2021 unfolds and social-distancing measures recede.

The short answer is that activity is set to heat up, which could also provide the first real test of the hidden inflationary pressures that might have built up over the past year. Whatever happens will likely prove crucial for the bitcoin market because the cryptocurrency has become one of the most popular ways for big investors to bet on the likelihood of rising prices or dollar debasement.

The U.S. Congressional Budget Office projected on Monday that gross domestic product will expand by 3.7% this year, after a 2.5% contraction in 2020. But Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. lender, is even more optimistic, recently boosting its forecast for this year’s growth to 6%, from 4.5% at the start of the year.

A key question for the inflation watchers, of course, is just how much stimulus money will be pumped into the economy by the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve.

President Joe Biden has proposed a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill, but a group of senators from the opposition Republican party on Monday released details of a $618 billion proposal they argue is more appropriate. Bank of America’s analysts assume the package will end up around $1 trillion.

Why it matters is that as Americans start to get out and about, a surge in consumer spending looks likely. The Bank of America analysts estimate there’s already some $1.6 trillion of excess savings that might start to trickle into the economy.

“The jolt from stimulus, the support of excess savings and the green light from lower virus cases should unleash pent-up consumer spending,” the Bank of America economists wrote. “Stronger growth means a lower unemployment rate and greater inflation pressure.”

That outlook raises the question of how the Fed might respond, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell stating last week that it’s “too early to be talking about dates“ for tapering the central bank’s $120-billion-a-month of bond purchases – funded via printing more money – that are currently ongoing to provide stimulus to financial markets.

By the middle of this year, if the economy is recovering quickly Powell and his colleagues might find it harder to characterize any talk of tapering as still too soon. Because these are typically well-telegraphed affairs, the actual tapering might start six to seven months after that. Call it early 2022.

“We believe the Fed will have difficulty justifying persistently large asset purchases in the face of a sustainable decrease in [COVID-19] cases, economic overheating, and frothy asset prices,” according to Bank of America.

On the other hand, the Fed might flinch.

“We can envision a scenario whereby the Fed signals an intention to taper/starts tapering, markets react negatively, and the Fed finds that they need to continue purchasing or extend the duration of their purchases in order to preserve market functioning,” according to Bank of America.

It’s that latter scenario – or even just the prospect of it – that might drive bitcoin prices a lot higher. Based on the reluctance of central bankers to withdraw stimulus, not to mention the market lurches late last year when a new U.S. stimulus bill seemed in doubt, the scenario isn’t all that implausible.

Bitcoin’s ongoing range play between $30,000 and $40,000 could end with a bullish breakout as demand from investors continues to outstrip new supplies of the cryptocurrency.

In 2021 so far, around 26,000 new bitcoins have been produced by miners on the Bitcoin blockchain, data provider Glassnode said in a weekly report. Yet, in the same period, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has acquired over 40,000 BTC. (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.)

In another bullish indicator, the number of coins held on exchange addresses continues to slide, interpreted as a sign of waning interest from sellers. The balance of bitcoin held across all exchanges fell to a 2.5-year low of 2,349,040 on Monday, according to Glassnode.

On the bearish side, a stronger dollar could play spoilsport to any push higher. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback’s value against major currencies, is looking north, with price charts showing a major bullish pattern known an “inverse head-and-shoulders breakout.”

“If a bullish trend develops from DXY’s latest breakout, it could be a problem for bitcoin,” trader and analyst Alex Kruger told CoinDesk.

The spillover to digital markets from the past week’s GameStop saga has taken on a new form: Soaring demand for digital tokens associated with cryptocurrency exchanges and the arcane but fast-growing arena of decentralized finance, known as DeFi, which could provide an alternative to Wall Street and traditional trading platforms.

“It seems investors are looking for the next trade to cycle through,” Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the cryptocurrency exchange firm EQUOS, wrote Tuesday in a note to clients.

The exchange Binance’s in-house BNB token hit a new all-time high on Monday, just days after rival FTX’s FTT token logged a new record, CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reported.

Prices have also hit new highs for tokens from decentralized exchanges, which are essentially just automated, blockchain-based software protocols that can be used to trade digital assets. Uniswap’s UNI and SushiSwap’s SUSHI both saw big price jumps – a dynamic that might reflect retail investors’ growing concerns with centralized trading platforms amid widespread anger over Robinhood’s trading suspensions last week. Trading volumes on the decentralized exchanges,, hit a record above $50 billion in January, CoinDesk’s Zack Voell reported.

Ether, the native blockchain of the Ethereum blockchain, where much of the DeFi development is taking place, has pushed back toward a record high above $1,400.

“Decentralized trading, decentralized lending, decentralized insurance, decentralized everything starts to make a lot more sense in light of what is happening today in the traditional financial system,” Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of the cryptocurrency-focused Arca Funds, wrote Monday in his weekly newsletter.

What's Hot

“It’s pretty obvious that the WSB traders are applying the same principles of the digital/CryptoAsset world to the stock market and they are loving the fact that the old schoolers are hating it,” billionaire Mark Cuban writes in a blog post. (CoinDesk)

Coinbase has reportedly tapped Nasdaq for its planned direct listing, according to The Block. Existing Coinbase investors have already been trading shares through Nasdaq’s Private Market platform, where the company has notched an implied valuation of $50 billion.

Winklevosses’ Gemini crypto exchange inks partnership with crypto lender Genesis to give customers option to earn up to 7.4% annual interest on holdings, CoinDesk’s Nathan DiCamillo reported. The new offering aims to lure away customers turned off by “anemic” interest rates from traditional banks, Gemini COO Noah Perlman said. According to DiCamillo, the annual yield is consistent with what’s typically seen among centralized crypto lenders but pales in comparison to yield farming interest rates in decentralized finance (DeFi), which are much higher but more erratic.

The latest on the economy and traditional finance

Robinhood has raised $3.4 billion from investors over the past several days, CoinDesk’s Danny Nelson reported. The online trading platform’s backers are apparently looking past the blowback from Robinhood’s trading suspensions amid the peak of the runup in prices for GameStop, AMC and other “meme stocks.” CFO Jason Warnick said the cash infusion will help Robinhood “scale to meet the incredible growth we’ve seen and demand for our platform.” Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev is expected to testify before the U.S. House of Representatives’ financial-services committee on Feb. 18, CoinDesk’s Sebastian Sinclair reported.

Even before the pandemic hit, global debt was at a far higher level than before the financial crisis of 2008, according to the International Monetary Fund. The figure reached $197 trillion at the end of 2019, for a debt-to-GDP ratio of 226%, according to an International Monetary Fund blog post on Monday. That compares with a ratio of 193% in 2007. But because of unusually accommodative monetary policies (i.e., interest rates set at close to zero or even negative levels), the average debt expense as a share of revenue was 0.3 percentage points lower in 2019, according to the IMF. With U.S. government debt alone rising by about $4 trillion to about $27 trillion, the year-end 2020 numbers are likely to look a lot uglier.

In short, it brings a combination of bank-grade custody and post-trade settlement to crypto.

“There is very little institutional-grade infrastructure within digital. In fact, I’m gobsmacked at how little there is,” said Cobalt Chairman Adrian Patten. “Also, I’ve noticed that in the crypto world everyone concentrates on the coin, the crypto bit. They forget the dollar. Whether that’s from a risk management perspective, management of collateral or settlement, that’s always the thing that holds them back.”

Specifically, the partnership involves integrating METACO’s institutional operating system for digital assets, SILO, with Cobalt’s interoperable FX and digital assets platform to offer a fully integrated end-to-end SaaS solution for the storage, limit allocation and intraday settlement of digital assets, per a press release.

“There’s a lot of friction in the market still,” said Seamus Donoghue, VP of sales and business development at METACO. “When you trade on exchanges or with counterparts in general, you have to pre-fund those positions. That’s capital intensive. There’s a counterparty risk there as well, and it’s just not a very efficient market.”

BBVA, StanChart and more

Between them the two firms have a hand in most of the major crypto banking plays happening in Europe right now. METACO is working on crypto custody with Standard Chartered, BBVA, DBS Bank and Gazprombank Switzerland. Cobalt is also involved with Standard Chartered and has other projects in the pipeline involving the likes of ErisX and LMAX Digital.

Cobalt’s Patten pointed out that banks and many regulated buy-side firms need certain processes and ways of doing things. “You can’t go settling a transaction on the back of emails. Which is what happens,” he said.

But it’s not just institutions looking for better digital asset trading infrastructure. Many of the largest crypto exchanges are in talks with the firms too, Patten said.

“Over 75% of our pipeline is crypto firms looking to upgrade their processes,” Patten said. “They’re having massive increases of volume and volatility, and they realize you can’t carry on doing it in this way. We’re going to be signing a bunch of these firms up in the first quarter.”","['settlement', 'banks', 'metaco', 'cobalt', 'thats', 'exchanges', 'infrastructure', 'digital', 'patten', 'trading', 'crypto', 'assets', 'upgrade', 'firms']","Announced Tuesday, METACO and Cobalt are launching a software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering that covers the full gamut of institutional trading requirements for digital assets.

The blockchain market isn’t far off from other markets, but is smaller than the U.S., European and Chinese markets. “There’s few companies or projects that have confidence in infrastructure development,” he said, noting novel base layers being developed in China. Addition to regulatory impediments, there are cultural barriers as well. “It’s hard to make money in this space, there’s no clear product-market fit for most blockchain projects,” meaning that most large Japanese companies are willing to make investments in distributed technologies.","['japanese', 'koinup', 'regulatory', 'higashi', 'development', 'projects', 'asia', 'crypto', 'blockchain', 'theres', 'narratives', 'markets', 'companies']","Asia Narratives: KoinupAsia is a hotbed for the development and adoption of crypto products and networks.

Melvin Capital, the $8 billion hedge fund that didn’t find GameStop (GME) funny, lost 53% of its portfolio in January ($7 billion) trying to short against the rallying cries of the Reddit Capitalist Union. Founder Gabe Plotkin also faces the embarrassment of having to get bailed out by his old boss.

Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter.

Speaking of, Steven A Cohen, New York Mets baseball team owner and former name-on-the-door of SAC Capital (known most recently for its insider trading fine of $1.8 billion), put $2.8 billion of capital into Melvin’s fund.

Ken Griffin, owner of the Citadel hedge fund (an investor in Melvin), and Citadel Securities (a massive market maker and buyer-of-order-flow for Robinhood), is seeing capital losses in the former and Washington, D.C., cries for scrutiny into market structure in regards to the latter.

Robinhood itself – which, for goodness sake, is not Wall Street but as Silicon Valley as it possibly gets – raised $1 billion immediately to protect itself from class-action lawsuits, DTCC capital calls and a now-rapidly closing IPO window. That means Yuri Milner of DST Global chipping in yet again.

That’s at least four people that have had a very bad, no good day.

The Reddit WallStreetBets army has eight million members. Robinhood has 13 million users. These are the opposing forces. They are, loosely speaking, having a pretty good day.

This isn’t about how much money you have. This is about a mindset and a framing of the world. It’s about who you are and who you are not.

But other billionaires are having way more fun. The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, is raising the crypto rallying flag and ex-Facebook billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya is trading along with Reddit for quick profits, decentralized hedge fund and all. This isn’t about how much money you have. This is about a mindset and a framing of the world. It’s about who you are and who you are not. And it’s about what you did and did not do.

Do you side with the internet’s gamer heroes, wearing Nyan cat shirts and crying out sarcastically for “moar Stonks, money printer go brrrr, number go up”! A post-Gawker-4chan swirl of human vectors, coalescing into one giant middle finger to every Karen and Ken? Dopamine splashing out from our pituitary glands into a vortex tornado of well-earned resentment.

Or, do you like your finance suited, ministerial, administrative and gated? Do you think it is storied, respectable and important. That you have to go to HYP and then do your “two and two” at Goldman and HBS before hopping to KKR or Tiger or SAC and then into your own cozy fund? All that work, all that sweat for the GMAT and the SAT and the bootlicking, to be undone by someone literally making fun of you in the language of money.

See also: Jill Carlson – GameStop and the Real Market Manipulators

It’s not about some truth about Wall Street or Silicon Valley or the internet or bitcoin or decentralized finance (DeFi) and least of all about GameStop (GME). Those are just flags of our armies. And we are at war with ourselves.

GameStop is a mall shop that sold video games. The mall shops that rented videos (Blockbuster) or sold books (Borders) are bankrupt and rightly dead. The internet, and its children Netflix and Amazon, killed them. And yet, their names are etched into the collective childhood memories of millions. GameStop has no chance against Steam or Epic – both brands that are also deeply loved by nerds all over the world. We say this as self-incrimination. And yet, GameStop is a symbol, a feeling, a reminiscence.

The person building financial models and analyzing this stuff according to economics is “right” to point out bad things about “fundamentals” of the business. Within the game of financial capital markets, the fundamentals are the gears of the economic machines that you evaluate with capital decisions. You buy good fundamentals, says Warren Buffett and you sell bad ones. Another Warren, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, also believes in fundamentals. She believes in them so much she wants the government to regulate them into the market and “fair, orderly and efficient function.”

All that might be right, and we are not doubting the wisdom of John Maynard Keynes or the animal spirits. But Warren Buffett is no longer number one. It’s an Elon Musk world now.

Fundamentals are what the financial doctors will tell you that you have. Do you think the internet cares about their diagnosis? No. The internet cares about being patronized by people in coats. Musk and Chamath are the mushrooms of the internet. It is in their DNA.

The GameStop trade itself is worth a pause. While some of the original thinking by DeepF**kingValue that led to his $30+ million capital gain reflected on the GameStop business, the core insight was market structure. The trade was not about GameStop beating its analyst estimates or any of that boring-play-by-the-rules stuff. It was about a short squeeze. It was about restricting the supply of the stock in such a way as to blow up a levered short bet that Melvin Capital was putting into play.

In other words, we are talking about the meta-game, not the grunt Excel spreadsheet game. SAC, Tiger, Point72, Melvin Capital and every other hedge fund worth its salt plays the meta-game. That’s the whole point. You get a PhD in financial instruments by doing the work and testing the levers rather than believing in them blindly. And WallStreetBets dared to play the meta-game as well. Retail investors aren’t supposed to self-organize into a hive-mind of levered derivatives strategy driven by spite. And here we are.

To go short, Melvin has to borrow. To borrow, you have to pay an interest rate. To cover your short, you have to buy back the stock. You’re paying an interest rate and have to buy back the stock. Nobody is selling you the stock, because they hate you. Everyone is buying, to troll you specifically. They are levering up with options. And you keep raising your bids until you cover your position.

Robinhood is a broker/dealer. It came into being in Silicon Valley, a place where consumer services are free because they are actually not services but honeypots that aggregate user demand, package it at large scale and re-sell attention to advertisers. Such is Facebook and Google. Our lives are better because of these services, but also compromised and profoundly insane.

Robinhood uses this playbook to aggregate consumer demand with the honeypot of free trading, and then sends it to market makers like Citadel Securities and gets paid $600 million for the orders. TD Ameritrade and eTrade and other discount brokers do this, too! But Robinhood does it most, and does it best. Check out our prior explanation with Paul Rowady here.

There is nothing unusually nefarious going on. It is just American capital markets structure and a clever lead-generation arbitrage. That is, if customers are still getting best-execution with Citadel. But the structure is ancient by modern technology standards, and far from real-time. It takes two days for a trade to settle, and this among other reasons leads to a requirement of capital to be placed with a “clearing house,” in this case the DTCC. Given the volatility in GameSpot caused by the internet trying to break a hedge fund the way George Soros broke the Bank of England, capital requirements skyrocketed tenfold.

Robinhood, as well as TD Ameritrade, ended up restricting trading in the instrument as a result of this capital call. If you are burning and raising a billion dollars per year, you probably don’t have a “tenfold” of cash lying around to give to the DTCC to make it feel comfy. So, you know, it just removed the “Buy” button for a whole bunch of crusaders on a mission with their capital on the line. They didn’t remove the “Sell” button, thereby throwing fire on the internet conspiracy meme machine.

Was this done on instruction from Citadel billionaires? Was this the banksters colluding against the common person? Was “Wall Street” trying to take away our constitutional freedom to trade on a mobile app? Even U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez found common ground in finding someone to blame!

It’s not a lot of rioters yet.

But remember, fintech – including Robinhood, Revolut, SoFi and the rest – is supposed to democratize access to financial services. That meant very little a decade ago, and “dumb money” was disorganized and uninformed. Now, information is free and available to all. Equities trading is largely costless and frictionless. And the scariest part, for the suited part of finance anyway, is that strength lies in numbers and can now self-organize.

In addition to this, we have the crypto currency ecosystem. Unlike fintech, which went after distribution, blockchain goes after manufacturing. If you are a trader or market maker on Ethereum, there is no clearinghouse. There is no broker/dealer. There is only you and the distributed machine with its smart contracts, automated rule sets and software-enforced property rights. All data is real-time. The blocks click into being one after another without a single lawyerly piece of paper in sight. Hundreds of millions of people in the world have touched this asset class and it renders financial intermediaries unnecessary in their imagination.

Now don’t get us wrong. A trade on Ethereum is going to cost you $10 to $100 today, and another 1% in slippage. It is going to cost you some immeasurable but ever-present probability of cyber risk and regulatory overhang. But you nobody can take away your “Buy” or “Sell” button, and the speed and scale issues are mere technical problems to be solved by the entrepreneurial gods.

Here’s the rub, post-fintech-crypto-democratization and all.

Humans are social animals. It is in our bones. The concept of fairness has been selected through the evolutionary filter and fueled a cooperation-based multi-billion person civilization.

Democracy is not oligarchy. Democracy means each person has one vote. If you were to vote according to assets under management, which is how finance has done it to date, you get very different outcomes than when you vote person by person. Now we have a set of promises and representation from companies like Robinhood that suggest a democratic empowerment of individuals to access the storied products of finance. Most people don’t know, or want to know, how the actual machine works. When the promises have a gap to reality, because of whatever reason, this creates kinetic energy for Twitter and Reddit.

It creates energy for people in the position of leverage who understand the machine, and want it to change. Elon Musk hates short-sellers for their damping, and perhaps manipulating, effect on his promises of Tesla greatness. Certainly Chamath, having launched endless SPACs to take Silicon Valley fintech distributors like SoFi public, understands the machine as well. For them, this tear in the fabric of reality is a power. It is a rallying cry.

Retail investors aren’t supposed to self-organize into a hive-mind of levered derivatives strategy driven by spite. And here we are.

If we really want to put this into dystopian context, let’s at least reference the theory of overcrowding elites from Peter Turchin. The historian eerily predicted the 2020 rioting and disaffection back in 2010, suggesting that societies fall apart when they over-produce members of the ruling class. Education has minted PhDs, MBAs and entrepreneurs who have no seat to inherit from a retiring predecessor. As a result, they take on the populist mantle and position themselves as outsiders to attack the insiders, while of course being fabulously gifted. Thus Donald Trump and all the rest.

If you are holding power today you probably don’t want everything to fall apart just because Redditors hate a caricatured notion of hedge funds. So you tweak things at the edges. Edit out the glitches in the current matrix. It is through this lens that we see Google deleting 100,000 negative Robinhood reviews for being “inauthentic.”

Of course they were coordinated. But they were very authentic to the people who wrote them. They were, however, “inauthentic” to the current rule-set of the game. Based on fundamentals, market structure and a variety of other “this is how things work” explanations, Robinhood did nothing wrong. Nor did Melvin, really, as far as we can tell from the media coverage. It just played a game that has become a cartoon that millions of people despise. Google’s app store is also an incumbent, a rule-set as well of what constitutes good behavior and what you should do according to its Terms, and so on. Protecting Robinhood’s reputation because it did not fundamentally err is what you do when you believe the current system works.","['billion', 'market', 'person', 'fund', 'internet', 'finance', 'sokolin', 'democratize', 'hedge', 'robinhood', 'capital', 'using', 'financial', 'gamestop', 'old', 'tech', 'cant']","The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, is raising the crypto rallying flag and ex-Facebook billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya is trading along with Reddit for quick profits, decentralized hedge fund and all.

Chaos ensued. Retail traders everywhere cried foul, accusing the startup brokerage of protecting hedge funds and the establishment at their expense. U.S. politicians across the spectrum, from Rep. AOC to Sen. Ted Cruz, came together to lambast the move on Twitter. Venture capitalists and technologists called into question the morality of Robinhood’s founders and proclaimed that the moment for decentralization had finally arrived.

Robinhood did not halt trading of GameStop to punish the insurgent mass of retail traders. Nor did it do so out of a paternalistic impulse to try to protect them. Robinhood halted trading of GameStop because it had to, thanks to a set of standards put in place by market players upstream. Robinhood’s clearing firm, the company that facilitates the settlement of the broker-dealer’s trades, could not keep up with the risk it was being asked to take on.

Jill Carlson, a CoinDesk columnist, is co-founder of the Open Money Initiative, a non-profit research organization working to guarantee the right to a free and open financial system. She is also an investor in early-stage startups with Slow Ventures.

Clearing firms exist in part to mitigate the consequences should a broker-dealer fail to meet its obligations. Clearing firms therefore need to keep a tight handle on risk. This means they need to put up more money to make good on trades as markets get whackier and whackier (that is, as volatility increases). The GameStop market was about as whacky as it gets. The clearing firm couldn’t take on any more risk. Robinhood couldn’t fork over any more funds to the clearing firm. The music had to stop.

These are precisely the type of controls that became so clearly important in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis: strict risk management, transparency, liquidity thresholds, and capital requirements. These standards were designed to prevent reckless behavior and to mitigate the fallout should a financial firm become overexposed. When retail traders demanded these rules be implemented on big institutions 10 years ago, they couldn’t have imagined those rules would someday shut them out of the market.

Yesterday highlights the importance of understanding all of the boring nuances of trading back offices and the standards, rules, regulations and protocols that go along with them. Settling a trade takes two days. Thus, clearing firms have two days of exposure to their counterparty firm.

Why does it take two days? People love to say this is a technology issue and that innovations like blockchains can fix this. The reality is, as with so many things that people claim blockchains can fix that this issue is almost entirely one of process and regulation. Perhaps new technology can be a catalyst to revisit these, but it is certainly not the limiting factor.

The Securities and Exchange Commission mandates settlement periods for securities to keep processes among counterparties running smoothly. There are plenty of short-term securities that do settle the same day like certificates of deposit and commercial paper. Equities take as long as they do in part because of historical precedent, dating from the times when technology was indeed the constraint. Every financial institution became accustomed to the processes involved in multi-day settlement periods. Financial institutions are generally slowly evolving creatures, meaning that which they are used to is that which they prefer. Because their processes are built around multi-day settlement, they continue to choose multi-day settlement. The solution to this is not a blockchain anymore than it is a centralized database.

Robinhood halted trading of GameStop because it had to, thanks to a set of standards put in place by market players upstream.

It is so tempting to turn these conversations into conversations about technology. If only we had a decentralized financial trading platform, we would be saved from the censorship imposed by Robinhood or clearing firms or the SEC, the thinking goes. If only we had equities on a blockchain, we would be saved from two day settlement periods and the risks and inefficiencies they impose.

But the issues lie not with the technology. They lie with the way the protocols, processes, rules and laws around the market were designed. And these kinds of issues do not go away no matter how decentralized your trading venue is or how many blockchains you are using.

There are, to be sure, many archaic and obsolete practices that those in charge of the markets continue to adhere to. But it is all too easy to blindly rail against these or to blame them on technology without examining where these practices came from or why they exist. In the most extreme cases, these processes prevail for risk management reasons. In more innocuous cases, these practices simply emerged from the human behavior of those interacting with the markets.

When XRP was de-platformed earlier this month by Coinbase and many others there was not a sudden rush of liquidity and activity on decentralized exchanges that list the asset. That is because traders did not want to touch the asset given the regulatory concerns around the asset.

Take also the question of whether markets should be open and active 24 hours, 7 days per week, 365 days per year. This is another area where I frequently hear people saying that new technology would resolve this, pointing to cryptocurrency markets that are always open. But there are already plenty of mainstream markets that are always open. All over-the-counter markets work this way on Wall Street. If I want to do an over-the-counter trade, I can theoretically call up a market maker any time and ask for a price. In all likelihood, though, I don’t want to. I want to wait for times when there is liquidity.

So much of how the financial market works is based on historical human behaviors, either codifying them into market standards or erecting guardrails against their natural tendencies. To be sure, developments of the last weeks and years demonstrate that many of these policies and procedures are worth revisiting. Cryptocurrency markets have proven that there might be demand for 24/7 markets, at least in some asset classes. GameStop has shown that certain retail broker-dealers might need to be better capitalized to anticipate the kind of groundswell behavior we have seen this week.","['settlement', 'market', 'stop', 'technology', 'markets', 'trading', 'risk', 'clearing', 'problem', 'jill', 'carlson', 'financial', 'gamestop', 'standards']","Robinhood did not halt trading of GameStop to punish the insurgent mass of retail traders.

This was the week the internet finally defeated Wall Street – at least for a few days. The wild rally in GameStop’s stock, fueled by an army of Reddit retail day traders, imposed devastating losses on hedge funds and showed how free trading tools and social media (memes) can now be harnessed by networks of individuals to achieve economic outcomes previously controlled by elites. The gobsmacking story of GameStop, Melvin Capital and r/WallStreetbets was tailor-made for the disruptive, anti-establishment vibe of the crypto community. This “WSB effect” theme runs throughout this week’s newsletter.

On the other side of the masses vs. establishment divide, this was also the week of the “Davos Agenda” virtual event, held in lieu of the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting. It included the likes of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Chinese President Xi Zinping, a host of Fortune 500 CEOs and so forth.

My podcast co-host Sheila Warren, who happens to be the WEF’s blockchain lead, invited long-time WEF Managing Director Adrian Monck to this week’s “Money Reimagined” show. We talked directly about how the old guard deals with the changes that radical outsiders, such as crypto developers and tribes of activist retail investors, present.

BTC and ETH: Made for each other

As of 11:00 a.m. ET Friday, the year-to-date returns for bitcoin and ether show an easily discernible reversal of the BTC dominance seen in late 2020. Bitcoin is up 27% year to date and ether, 92%.

What’s going on here? Well, before we try to answer that, a caveat: If the past week’s WallStreetBets-vs-hedge funds spectacle has taught us anything, it’s that in today’s meme-consuming, radically democratizing markets, confidently defining fundamental reasons for price movements is difficult. What matters is which narrative is winning.

Well, before we try to answer that, a caveat: If the past week’s WallStreetBets-vs-hedge funds spectacle has taught us anything, it’s that in today’s meme-consuming, radically democratizing markets, confidently defining fundamental reasons for price movements is difficult. What matters is which narrative is winning. Narrative? So prices are just make-believe? Well, yes, but stories have always been about how people – and thus markets – reach consensus. It used to be Wall Street controlled the narrative. It’s unclear whether that’s still the case.

Well, yes, but stories have always been about how people – and thus markets – reach consensus. It used to be Wall Street controlled the narrative. It’s unclear whether that’s still the case. So, what narrative best explains ETH outperforming BTC? Well, let’s first challenge the “Tulip Bubble” angle that mainstream crypto critics might instinctively apply here: The idea this is a rerun of the 2017 bitcoin rally, which pushed speculators into comparatively cheaper tokens only to foster the mother of all bubbles. The loss suffered this week by short-selling hedge funds at the expense of hordes of retail investors from the r/WallStreetBets subreddit shows it’s dangerous to conclude that large groups of determined bulls are inherently wrong.



This is not to say ETH’s price won’t correct as bitcoin’s has this month. It just means we owe it to ourselves to explore other narratives.

This is not to say ETH’s price won’t correct as bitcoin’s has this month. It just means we owe it to ourselves to explore other narratives. Such as? Here’s one: There’s a BTC-to-ETH price rotation going on that suggests thoughtful investors are starting to see Ethereum, and more specifically the decentralized finance (DeFi) applications built on it, as a constructive complement to Bitcoin. As sophisticated investors increasingly recognize bitcoin’s potential as a “digital gold” store of wealth, the thesis goes, they will soon see DeFi as a means to creatively unlock that value – for payments, for loans, for insurance, and so forth.



This take sees Bitcoin as the base layer protocol for a software stack that handles the internet’s value storage and exchange. Bitcoin the currency is a simple yet hard-to-change, highly secure store of value. Much like gold, it doesn’t do much; you just lock it away and use it as security to back up your other investments and financial activity. But because it’s built on a permissionless protocol, developers can still do many more creative things with it than, say, a gold custodian can do with bullion.



That’s where Ethereum and DeFi come in. With smart contracts, oracles, decentralized exchanges and multi-sig systems for securing digital assets, the degens of DeFi are now incorporating bitcoin into their freewheeling, “composable” world of decentralized financial products. Hence the summer explosion of wrapped bitcoin tokens such as WBTC.



To go back to the software stack analogy, Ethereum is middleware and DeFi occupies the application layer.

(Moe Na/CoinDesk)

Analogies are also being made to the traditional finance “stack.” RealVision CEO Raoul Pal says bitcoin is “pristine collateral” that could even take on the $123 trillion market for U.S. Treasury bonds as the base-level security for all credit. It’s appeal is not only that it’s a provably scarce asset, but also that it can be locked up in escrow through a decentralized smart contract that leaves neither lenders nor borrowers vulnerable to the failures of a middleman. You build DeFi’s lending, borrowing and insuring products on top of that feature and you now have the makings of a financial system.

Asked by CoinDesk contributor Jeff Wilser if he would ever see bitcoin as something more than a speculative investment, Dallas Mavericks owner and CNBC “Shark Tank” personality Mark Cuban responded, “Sure. If DeFi and BTC can evolve together in a manner that allows BTC to effectively be a bank account without the bank. That creates utility for BTC.” What does he think of Ethereum? “I like ETH. Obviously it’s a primary foundation for DeFi, and we will see what happens with ETH 2.”

Obviously it’s a primary foundation for DeFi, and we will see what happens with ETH 2.” Ah, Eth 2. The Elephant in the Room. If Ethereum 2.0 succeeds, over the next couple of years the blockchain will transition from a proof-of-work consensus model to proof-of-stake and will allow massively more transaction-processing capability. That scalability is needed if Ethereum is to play a meaningful role in the global financial system. But the transition is incredibly difficult to pull off within a large, decentralized community of users where billions of dollars are at stake.



Still, there seems to be early optimism around Eth 2.0. The amount of ether locked and staked on the transitional Beacon Chain has steadily risen to more than 2.8 million ETH as of Wednesday (an amount currently worth about $3.89 billion). Indeed, ether’s steady January gain to an all-time high of $1,476.12 on Sunday was itself an expression of confidence in that project.

There’s a boom in non-fungible tokens, also captured in the Cuban interview. And there’s support, including from suddenly in-the-news social media platform Reddit, for using so-called layer 2 scaling solutions such as Plasma to expand Ethereum’s use cases. Meanwhile, EY blockchain lead Paul Brody is predicting financial institutions will bring DeFi to the masses.



All of this points to an expanding and diversifying Ethereum ecosystem. For a blockchain, that’s the best story you can tell: a growing network.

Did Trump help bitcoin’s late-2020 surge?

Since we’re talking about narratives, let’s look at how we might visually represent a market-justifying story. I’ve chosen a take by CoinDesk Global News Editor Kevin Reynolds on the role played by fears of electoral chaos on bitcoin’s price rise during the late fall and early winter. I can buy this story: If bitcoin is digital gold, it should work as a backstop against dystopia. But what I also found interesting was how easy it was to illustrate this idea on a chart. I just grabbed a few election-related statements by former President Donald Trump and his supporters, got CoinDesk data visualizer Shuai Hao to mark them on a four-month chart from our subsidiary company TradeBlock and the yellow line did the rest.

TradeBlock XBX (Shuai Hao/CoinDesk) Source: https://tradeblock.com/markets/index

(NOTE: This chart was produced late Thursday New York time, before bitcoin’s huge leap to a new post-Jan. 8 high of $38,000 early Friday morning. The story may need a new chapter. Arrival of the WSB effect?)

Kevin argues that electoral fear added an extra $10,000 to the all-time high that was hit right after the climactic Jan. 6 raid on Congress. The rest of the gains came from the standard stuff everyone was talking about: mainly that institutional investors were now adding bitcoin to their long-term portfolios. So, when things simmered down and new President Joseph Biden was sworn in, bitcoin’s price eased to what would be fair value in normal times – you know, amid a normal global pandemic and economic depression.

The Conversation: Ants vs. elephants

In 2014, when the idea of decentralized autonomous organizations was first being kicked around, crypto pioneer and DAO enthusiast Joel Dietz founded a decentralized fundraising platform called “Swarm.” (It has since evolved into Swarm Capital, which provides tools for companies to issue security tokens.) The name always struck me as an evocative one for an entity comprising many individuals without centralized control.

Now, after digesting this heady week on Wall Street, the term seems especially apt. I’m talking, of course, about how retail investors in a Subreddit that quickly swelled to 4.4 million people collectively forced big hedge funds into a “short squeeze” on supposedly has-been “meme stocks” such as GameStop, AMC Entertainment and BlackBerry. The WSB group maneuver imposed billions of dollars of losses on those institutions. Melvin Capital needed an injection of $2.75 billion from Citadel and Point72. One thinks of a swarm of ants attacking elephants.

That the name stems from a crypto venture is also fitting since the WSB saga prompted an outpouring of interest from the crypto community. It had all the elements of a crypto drama, even though the battle never occurred on a blockchain.

For one, there was a much-discussed CNBC interview with Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya, who had spent time trawling through the r/WallStreetBets posts and, following the group’s lead, made a $500,000 profit. Declaring that what he “learned over the last couple of days is important for everybody that’s watching CNBC,” Chamath said the insurgent investor movement was “a pushback against the establishment in a very important way,” one that harked back to the 2008 financial crisis. It captured the rebellious, anti-Wall Street vibe that’s long been part of the crypto community.

As the drama unfolded, Crypto Twitter lit up with people drawing parallels with and lessons about the crypto scene.

In a tweet thread about people demanding change to a system rigged for the big guys, Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz said the movement was “a giant endorsement of DeFi.”

Then, on Thursday, when the Redditors’ favored trading app, Robinhood, shut down access to the the stocks in question – creating a vitriolic backlash in what one observer called the trading app’s own “Streisand Effect” – the crypto community leapt to remind the world that this could never happen on a decentralized exchange. It was the perfect opportunity for Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift, to weigh in about his company’s new decentralized offering.

Then, inevitably, the WSB phenomenon spread into the crypto world’s very own “meme token,” Dogecoin, which soared more than 800% to a new record high.

CoinDesk’s own Will Foxley couldn’t resist:

Going into the year-end was an exciting period for bitcoiners. Many large-name investors emerged to declare their appreciation of bitcoin’s potential and the price responded accordingly.

As the price dropped back in the latter part of January, the “institutions are coming” rallying cry tempered. Big-name investors still showed interest in bitcoin, but some of their messages emphasized their caution and focused on the challenges they still see bitcoin facing before it attains a widely recognized place in institutional portfolios. CoinDesk’s coverage this past week captured that. (We’ll have to see how next week’s stories look if bitcoin holds the gains it enjoyed Friday morning and as these institutions take stock of the powerful reckoning they’ve been confronted via a retail investor insurrection.)

Guggenheim Partners Chief Investment Officer Scott Minerd, who made waves last year when he assigned a long-term target of $400,000 to bitcoin, didn’t exactly retract that prediction but added an implicit “not any time soon” caveat. In a Bloomberg interview he said, “Right now, the reality of the institutional demand that would support a $35,000 price or even a $30,000 price is just not there.” After Friday’s jump, that comment is looking a little off.

Journalists are always looking for comments from Dallas Mavericks owner and CNBC “Shark Tank” personality Marc Cuban. Crypto journalists are no exception. So, we were thrilled that CoinDesk contributor Jeff Wilser had a rich exchange with Cuban this week. As discussed above, Cuban sees real potential in bitcoin, especially if it can team up with DeFi. But as a standalone investment for now, his current view is, let’s say, “meh.”

We’ve also long been trying to get legendary Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio’s thoughts on bitcoin. He has remained mostly skeptical, even if his tone has become moderately more upbeat over time and his view has emerged only via small snippets of commentary. Finally, in his widely read Daily Observations newsletter, Dalio and his team have delivered a detailed, deep-dive analysis of bitcoin’s opportunities and challenges. I’d say Dalio still has a small amount of learning to do – for example, on why bitcoin can’t easily be replaced by a “better” cryptocurrency – but otherwise this is a brilliant analysis. His team’s assessment of bitcoin’s infamous volatility and why that makes it hard for portfolio managers to adopt it as loss-mitigating uncorrelated asset is masterful. (Oh, and I’m super excited to tell you that Dalio will be a headline keynote at CoinDesk’s Consensus event in May. Stay tuned for more exciting speaker announcements as we update the events page.)

Perhaps the most important news of the week on the institutional investor side was Ian Allison’s scoop that the trustees who run the endowments of Harvard, Yale, Brown and other universities have been investing in bitcoin for over a year. What we need to know is why. The colleges are, for now, keeping the justification for their entry into this market close to their chest. Without that, it’s hard to know whether they’ll keep it up.","['bitcoins', 'price', 'michael', 'casey', 'ethereum', 'defi', 'investors', 'week', 'eth', 'wall', 'decentralized', 'crypto', 'bitcoin', 'narratives', 'cant', 'control', 'street']","This was the week the internet finally defeated Wall Street – at least for a few days.

Bitcoin’s algorithmically determined rate of increase certainly makes it scarce when demand for the bitcoin cryptocurrency is rising, though not so much when it is falling. Furthermore, the fact that the algorithm provides for bitcoin’s supply to stop increasing about 120 years from now means that its supply is finite. Unless the code is changed (and that raises questions about what “Bitcoin” even means), there can never be more than 21 million bitcoins.

As I will show, however, bitcoin’s scarcity doesn’t stem from its finite nature, but from potentially infinite – though fickle – demand. And its legendary volatility is linked less to its scarcity or its finite nature and more to its inherent inflexibility. These distinctions may sound slight, but I argue they amount to important revisions of our understanding of this technology.

Scarcity is hardly unique to bitcoin. All assets are scarce. Indeed anything that has a price is scarce, by definition. If there is no scarcity, there is no price. Things that are so abundant that everyone can have all they want are free, even if they are objectively valuable to humans. Air, for example, is free, though it is so valuable to humans that we can’t exist without it.

Price is the mechanism by which markets equilibrate the supply of, and demand for, scarce objects. When there is more demand for a product than supply, the price rises until demand falls sufficiently for supply to be adequate. This means some people’s demand for the product will be partly or completely unsatisfied. In a free market, it is normal – indeed necessary – for people to be priced out of the market.

Conversely, when there is a greater supply of a product than demand, its price falls until demand rises sufficiently to mop up the excess. In retail markets, price falls might take the form of discounting and special offers.

Sometimes there is no demand for a product at any price, even a negative one. “You can’t pay people to take it away,” as the saying goes. There may be a limited supply of these things no one wants, but it is ridiculous to call them “scarce.” There are far too many of them. When there is an over-supply of a product, it becomes not simply worthless but costly to the holder because it incurs storage and disposal charges.

This brings me to what I regard as the fundamental problem with the definition of scarcity used by Bitcoin’s advocates. They confuse “scarce” with finite. It’s not necessary for something to have a fixed supply for it to be scarce; and things whose supply is constantly increasing are not necessarily abundant.

The passenger pigeon

To illustrate the difference between abundant, scarce and finite, let’s consider the sad story of the passenger pigeon, a bird once native to the U.S. but now extinct.

Back in the 19th century, passenger pigeons were so abundant that observers described them as “darkening the sky” in flight. They were a serious nuisance to crops but a free source of meat and eggs. So people were paid to kill them.

As people killed passenger pigeons by the millions and destroyed their forest breeding grounds, their numbers crashed. Lawmakers did not believe that something so abundant could ever become scarce, so attempts to protect the bird with legislation failed, The carnage continued and the species went into terminal decline.

The last wild bird is thought to have been shot in 1901. The birds survived in zoos for a few more years, but breeding proved impossible. The last passenger pigeon, Martha, died in the Cincinnati Zoo on Sept. 1, 1914. She was (and remains, since after her death she was stuffed) a bird of infinite value, the last of her kind and the icon of her species.

While passenger pigeons still existed in the wild, their supply was not finite. They nested, laid eggs and brought up chicks. But the rate at which they reproduced could not keep up with the rate at which humans were destroying them, so they became scarce. If humans had stopped shooting them and stealing their eggs, their supply would have increased again. In contrast, if bitcoins are lost, they can never be replaced. The supply is permanently reduced. So bitcoins are finite, but the passenger pigeon was not.

Bitcoin is therefore intrinsically volatile, not because of its scarcity or its finite nature, but because of its inflexibility.

The passenger pigeon became scarce not because it had a finite supply, but because demand for it far exceeded the rate at which its supply was increasing. And because humans refused to believe it was becoming scarce, its price failed to rise to match supply and demand. The “stickiness” of the passenger pigeon’s zero price ensured its demise. This is a type of market failure known as the “tragedy of the commons.” As Joni Mitchell sang, “You don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone.”

Towards its end, the passenger pigeon became both scarce and finite because it would not breed in captivity. That ultimately is why it became extinct. But had the zoos been able to establish successful breeding programs, the passenger pigeon would not have been finite. It might still be with us today. And like all endangered species, it would now be protected by law. Endangered species aren’t finite but they are so scarce and valuable that people risk their lives to protect them.

So it is not a finite supply that creates scarcity. It is a persistent excess of demand over supply. In a well-functioning market, if demand for a product rises faster than its supply, its price will rise even though its supply is increasing.

For some kinds of good, there are natural limits to demand: Everyone needs water, but there is a limit to how much water people can drink. However, drinkable water is scarce and the population is growing. Even if the supply of drinkable water increases, therefore, it will remain scarce as long as the rate of increase is the same or lower than the rate of increase of the population.

But for other types of good, such as gold and bitcoin, demand is potentially insatiable. The price of these things should therefore rise continually even if the supply is uncapped and continually increasing, provided the rate of increase is not so great that people lose interest. So it’s possible to continually create more of something without making it so abundant that it becomes worthless.

What this means for bitcoin

And this brings me back to bitcoin. Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap does not make it scarce. After all, 21 million of things no one wants is abundance (or “oversupply”), not scarcity. Like every asset, bitcoin is scarce when demand for it exceeds the available supply. When demand crashes, as it did in 2014 and 2018, bitcoin can’t really be said to be scarce, even though the supply hasn’t increased. However, Bitcoin’s supply algorithm does affect the price because it makes it impossible for bitcoin’s supply to respond to demand. Just as passenger pigeons couldn’t increase their rate of reproduction to compensate for the rate at which humans were killing them, so Bitcoin can’t increase or reduce its rate of production to compensate for changes in demand for bitcoins. And in a well-functioning market, when supply can’t respond to demand, the price must adjust.","['bitcoins', 'price', 'scarce', 'finite', 'supply', 'passenger', 'frances', 'rate', 'demand', 'bitcoin', 'coppola', 'rethinking', 'scarcity']","Furthermore, the fact that the algorithm provides for bitcoin’s supply to stop increasing about 120 years from now means that its supply is finite.
