CHAPTER ONE: Listening to the Past

“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.” — Satoshi Nakamoto

The trusted third party problem has haunted modern financial systems and centralized exchanges because people require an intermediary to make them work. The third party’s good or bad motives become a defining aspect of the transaction, and the those who use the institutions are at the mercy of those intentions. This is especially true of the current system of state-issued money and central banking.

A trustless system avoids intermediaries and does not depend upon the intentions of participants; that is, the system functions in the same manner regardless of anyone’s intentions. The blockchain, with a transparent and immutable peer-to peer protocol, is called trustless because there is no corruptible intermediary upon whom exchanges must depend.

On a small scale, the trusted third party problem may always exist because a middleman is useful or necessary in some situations. If third parties offer competitive services on a free market, however, the damage of dishonesty or incompetence is limited. People can take their business elsewhere, report a swindler to watchdogs, warn others, and file a lawsuit.

An occasionally dishonest third party is not the problem Satoshi addresses. He speaks to the institutionalized corruption of government and central banks from which the average person could not escape by using a competitor or by suing. Almost everyone who works over the table, runs a business, buys or sells goods, accepts government benefits or pays taxes has had to accept a fiat that constantly plunges in value due to inflation. Almost everyone who uses credit, accepts checks, takes out loans, conducts commerce or does business abroad has needed to go through banks that steal like drunken muggers.

For average people, the situation used to seem hopeless because no legal, practical, and private alternative existed for transferring funds across considerable distance, including borders. Attempts to reform or remove the system also seemed doomed because it was inherently corrupt and self-serving. In fact, fiat and central banking were serving the purpose for which they had been established: financial control by elites. People’s need for money and exchange became their straitjackets.

Then Satoshi. Then the blockchain and crypto. A new concept of money was created in a form that cannot not be inflated; the number of bitcoins is fixed at 21 million divisible units. The supply can only decrease when coins are lost, as inevitably happens. Satoshi notes, “Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.” Bitcoin solved the fiat problem.

A new concept of financial transfer solved the third party problem, especially with regard to banks. Although peer-to-peer transactions involve a middleman or miner, no trust is required since the transaction is released only when “proof of work” is rendered, which consists of solving a complicated math problem. Arriving at a solution may be costly in computer power and time, but the solutions themselves are easy to verify. Satoshi comments, “With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.” The soundness and propriety of the blockchain’s protocol itself is assured by the use of open source that is visible to all and verifiable. The political outcome: A private currency and method of exchange freed people from financial oppression.

The idea of private currency itself is hardly new, however.

Precedent in Radical Individualist Theory

The late Friedrich Hayek is the most respected Austrian economist of the 20th century. His book The Denationalisation of Money: An Analysis of the Theory and Practice of Concurrent Currencies argues vigorously for private and competitive currencies to displace government-issued ones. Hayek ponders a key question. “When one studies the history of money one cannot help wondering why people should have put up for so long with governments exercising an exclusive power over two thousand years that was regularly used to exploit and defraud them. This can be explained only by the myth” that government money was necessary “becoming so firmly established that it did not occur even to the professional students of these matters…ever to question it. But once the validity of the established doctrine is doubted its foundation is rapidly seen to be fragile.”

Governments reap incredible profits from debasing the currency, but the rigged game works only if people have no alternative but to play it. The political purpose of legal tender and banking laws is to grant a monopoly to the state, which permits the redistribution of wealth and power from average people upward to the elite of society. Fiat money and banking remains fragile, however, because the system relies on people either not understanding the dynamics or not having a choice. Hayek wonders why public understanding is so elusive. Why was “a government monopoly of the provision of money…universally regarded as indispensable” and what would happen “if the provision of money were thrown open to the competition of private concerns supplying different currencies?”

With eerie prescience, Hayek argues for currencies developed by entrepreneurs who innovate new forms of money just as they innovate in other areas. One of the drawbacks of government’s monopoly is that it imposes a freeze on the sort of invention that now runs free in crypto. The voluntaryist historian Carl Watner observes, “No one can tell in advance what form these monies might take because no one can know for sure what choices individuals would make or what new technologies might be discovered. Laws forcing people to use the Federal Reserve System money have frozen monetary developments at a certain stage…Just imagine if Congress had protected the Post Office by passing laws that would have prevented people from communicating via the internet. We would never have experienced the marvels of e-mail.”

The late Austrian economist Murray Rothbard also wrestles with the question of “why do people so vigorously resist private currencies?” His book For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto advances an explanation. “If the government and only the government had had a monopoly of the shoe manufacturing and retailing business, how would most of the public treat the libertarian who now came along to advocate that the government get out of the shoe business and throw it open to private enterprise?” Rothbard predicts that the skeptics would attack the libertarian for depriving them of the only possible source of shoes—the government. People are thoroughly indoctrinated to believe that daily life cannot function without the state and fiat.

Hayek and Rothbard are unusual among free-market economists in their embrace of private money and monetary systems. Even laissez-faire zealots rarely champion free-market currencies or private banking. Instead, they debate marginal issues such as fractional reserve and other reforms they think will improve the existing system. Or they argue for the restoration of a gold standard as though it were a panacea. But if a gold standard were applied to fiat, the system would still require people to trust the government and banks. This means trusting both institutions to act against their own interests, which they have historically neglected to do.

The modern neglect of free-market money and banking is odd because 19th century radical individualists focused intensely on the importance of private money and private banking to personal freedom. They placed a primal emphasis on the right of every individual to create his own currency and to function as his own bank. It was a natural right as important as freedom of speech or of religion. The pivotal individualist Benjamin Tucker believed that the right to issue private currency was so important that it could destroy the State all by itself. His reasoning: The money monopoly, including control of credit, was how the State sustained itself and robbed average people not merely of wealth but also of economic opportunity.

Two specific events sculpted the approach that the early individualist-anarchists adopted toward the monetary monopoly. One was the Panic of 1837 that tipped the United States into recession until the mid-1840s. Commonly cited causes of the Panic include a collapsing land bubble and a sharp fall in cotton prices. Blame is also placed at the feet of President Andrew Jackson for vetoing the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States and precipitating an unfortunate chain of economic events. Drawing on the work of Professor of Economics Peter Temin, Rothbard disputes this interpretation.

First, he [Temin] points out that the price inflation really began earlier, when wholesale prices reached a trough of 82 in July 1830 and then rose by 20.7 percent in three years to reach 99 in the fall of 1833. The reason for the price rise is simple: The total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $159 million in 1833, an increase of 45.9 percent, or an annual rise of 15.3 percent. Breaking the figures down further, the total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $155 million a year and a half later, a spectacular expansion of 35 percent. Unquestionably, this monetary expansion was spurred by the still-flourishing Bank of the United States, which increased its notes and deposits from January 1830 to January 1832 from a total of $29 million to $42.1 million, a rise of 45.2 percent. Thus, the price and money inflation in the first few years of the 1830s were again sparked by the expansion of the still-dominant central bank.

Arguably, the Panic began in May 1837 when banks in New York City announced they would not redeem commercial paper for specie at full face value. Of the approximately 800 banks in America, all but six ceased at one point or another to redeem banknotes and deposits for gold or silver coins. Suspicion and hatred of traditional banks and government-issued money soared, with radicals scrutinizing alternate systems.

The other event dramatically to impact the radical fever from monetary reform was the Civil War for which the North financed its fighting through Legal Tender Acts and the National Banking Act of 1863.

The radicals did not merely theorize; they experimented with private currencies and new economic models. Their efforts are fascinating, but they are also cautionary tales. A major problem for 19th-century individualist-anarchism was the movement’s general acceptance of a link between sound money and the labor theory of value. This theory states that the true value of a good or service is based on the labor required to produce it rather than the price at which a seller and buyer are willing to exchange. In short, a good has intrinsic and not subjective value. (More on this in the section on the Regression Theorem.) Happily, their main economic goal was the abolition of the “money monopoly.” The term referred to three different but interacting forms of monopoly: banking, the charging of interest, and the privileged issuance of currency. The abolition of state power over currency was the focus, and they eschewed the use of force to implement their own schemes.

Josiah Warren provided a real-world example of what was meant by a currency that rested on the labor theory of value. Credited with being the first American anarchist, Warren tested his specific solution to the money monopoly through a Time Store from which he issued “Labor Notes.” In 1827, the business opened with $300 worth of groceries and dry goods that were offered at a 7 percent markup from Warren’s own costs in order to cover expenses such as overhead. This was before groceries were prepackaged or preweighed, and it was usual for buyers to bargain with the shopkeeper rather than pay a posted price. One of

Warren’s innovations was to post prices, which drove costs lower because transactions consumed less time. The customer paid in traditional money for the goods and paid with a Labor Note to compensate Warren for his time. The Labor Note obliged the customer to provide Warren with an equivalent amount of his time. If the buyer was a seamstress, for example, the Labor Note committed her to render to Warren X units of time to produce clothing. Warren’s goal was to establish an economy—or to establish a proof of principle, at least—in which profit was based on the exchange of time and labor. The Labor Notes were circulated and traded widely with in the community.

To some degree, Warren succeeded. People traveled from a hundred miles away to avail themselves of the Time Store’s low prices. After a few years, he declared the experiment to be a success and closed the store. Whether the Labor Notes were a success is questionable, however. The store itself may well have succeeded due to its low prices, not to the Notes. Whichever explanation is true, it is difficult to see how this novel currency could function in dense populations or on a grander scale of commerce. Few people today would be convinced of the viability of private money based on the Time Store experiment.

What could convince the public and economists that private currencies work as well or better than government-issued ones? Going back a bit further in American history is a good place to start because the future is always based on the past.

A U.S. federal judge has rejected a motion filed by a former Ethereum Foundation developer over allegations of assisting North Korea to bypass sanctions. Prosecutors claim, Virgil Griffith, aided the regime by providing critical information on cryptocurrencies.

Prosecutors Say Griffith’s Speech Was About the Use of Cryptos to Circumvent Sanctions

Per Law360, a jury is now set to determine if Griffith violated the International Emergency Economic Powers Act by giving a speech at the Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference in 2019.

Kevin Castel, a U.S. District Judge, denied Griffith’s motion because the “short and vague” four-page indictment lacked specific details of his alleged criminal actions. He further commented on the matter:

Examining the indictment in light of the parties’ arguments, the court concludes that it provides adequate notice of the charges against Griffith sufficient to enable him to prepare for trial and, if it becomes necessary, plead double jeopardy as a defense. Further, upon review of the law governing the offense conduct, the indictment states a federal crime and violates no constitutional prohibition.

Prosecutors accused the former Ethereum Foundation developer of giving a speech in Pyongyang about the use of cryptocurrencies to get around U.S. economic sanctions.

Griffith was arrested on Thanksgiving Day in 2019. However, on December 30, 2019, he was granted bail by U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick.

Many crypto supporters stood up for Griffith’s cause when he was arrested, and influencers like John McAfee called the U.S. government “corrupt at the core.”

Griffith didn’t receive permission from the U.S. Department of Justice to travel to South Korea for the conference. However, per court documents, he got the approval of the North Korean United Nations (UN) Mission in Manhattan and was granted a visa.

Griffith Claims His Speech Was Based on Publicly-Available Information About Blockchain

The Ethereum proponent alleges he gave very basic information about blockchain to about 100 North Koreans who attended his speech. Also, he adds that everything said in his participation is publicly available on the internet. However, prosecutors believe North Korea could use his speech’s content to launder money and bypass sanctions potentially.

Also, the court revealed a message sent by Griffith to colleagues in 2018 before his speech, which reads as follow:

We’d love to make an Ethereum trip to the DPRK and set up an Ethereum node … It’ll help them circumvent the current sanctions on them.

But the former blockchain developer claimed in his rejected motion that such speech was protected by the First Amendment freedom of speech.

As of press time, the court date for Griffith’s case is still set for September 2021.

The Indian government has finally moved forward with a cryptocurrency bill. Entitled “The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2021,” the bill has been listed for consideration in the current parliamentary session of Lok Sabha, the lower house of India’s parliament. It seeks to create a framework for India’s official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) but prohibit all cryptocurrencies.

Indian Government Set to Introduce Cryptocurrency Bill in Current Parliamentary Session

After almost two years of waiting, the Indian government has finally moved forward with a cryptocurrency bill. According to Lok Sabha’s bulletin dated Jan. 29, the bill entitled “The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2021” is listed for consideration in the current parliamentary session. The budget session of Parliament commenced on Friday and will conclude on April 8, with a recess between Feb. 15 and March 8. The union budget will be presented on Feb. 1.

The bulletin lists the bills the Indian government has sent to be taken up during the budget session. Among them is the cryptocurrency bill, whose description reads:

To create a facilitative framework for [the] creation of the official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India. The bill also seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India, however, it allows for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses.

The Mint publication explained: “In the legislative order of business for the budget session of 17th Lok Sabha that commenced today, the government has listed a bill providing for the banning of all private cryptocurrencies in India such as bitcoin, ether, ripple, and others.”

This bill to ban cryptocurrencies resembles the crypto bill drafted by an interministerial committee (IMC) headed by former Finance Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg. That bill, dated February 2019, was unveiled by the finance ministry in July 2019. It proposes to ban all private cryptocurrencies and provides for the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital rupee. Garg has since resigned from his government work and the finance ministry had been silent on the bill until now.

On Monday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) published a booklet on India’s payment systems acknowledging the popularity of cryptocurrencies. The central bank also confirmed that it is “exploring the possibility as to whether there is a need for a digital version of fiat currency and in case there is, then how to operationalise it.” In December, the finance ministry was reported to be considering imposing an 18% goods and services tax (GST) on bitcoin transactions.

First Introduction of Crypto Bill in Parliament, Crypto Community’s Reaction

Although there have been reports of the Indian government planning to prohibit cryptocurrencies before, this is the first time that a bill to ban crypto has been listed for consideration in Lok Sabha.

The Indian crypto community disapproves of the government’s decision. “That’s insane,” one Twitter user wrote. Another warned that the RBI better not ban bitcoin, stating that the “Crypto bill should not be a FUD at this point or India will miss out on the momentum and innovation in the decentralization space.”

The CEO of the Indian crypto exchange Wazirx, Nischal Shetty, commented: “A country as large as India should at least work on understanding the underlying terminologies before presenting technology-related bills in parliament. Seems like a hurried move. If done wrong, this can potentially destroy a lot of value held by the general public.” He added, “Let’s hope this is a precursor to positive crypto regulations,” emphasizing:

Just because a bill is presented doesn’t mean it’ll be cleared … Wrong or hasty regulations will set us back by a decade. Right regulations will catapult India to the forefront of this technology.

“We have leaders who are technologically capable and they’ll definitely raise issues around this,” the CEO believes.

Neeraj Khandelwal, co-founder and chief technology officer at Coindcx, another Indian cryptocurrency exchange, pointed out that it is estimated that there are more than five million Indians holding “a combined wealth of $10 billion in bitcoin which is 2% of India’s forex reserves, taxation on crypto can fetch a few billion dollars in taxes to the Indian govt.” He reiterated that “Previous attempts to ban bitcoin in India have been unsuccessful. The industry has survived 2 years during the RBI imposed banking ban.”

The Indian crypto ban news came after a price spike in bitcoin following Tesla CEO Elon Musk changing his Twitter profile to “#bitcoin” and tweeted, “In retrospect, it was inevitable.”

Ukraine’s government-owned nuclear power plant picked a firm to build a massive data center in Rivne for cryptocurrency mining operations. After a bidding process, Energoatom chose Kyiv Energy Construction Company to handle the nuclear plant crypto mining project.

Nuclear Power Plant Operator Expects to Launch the Data Center in 2022

According to official documents, the data center will be based in the Rivne nuclear power plant, after the construction firm got 8.92 million Hryvnia ($317,620) in funding. The only competitor in the bidding was Ukrenergobudproek. However, they allegedly made an expensive offer, said the regional news outlet Forklog.

The Kyiv Energy Construction Company expects to finish the data center building by August 31, 2022. Per the announcement, the contractor is required to send the documentation that details the whole process. It includes “host state registers, electronic archives, and computing facilities.”

In terms of technical details, the nuclear power plant has a capacity of 2,657 megawatts, and it was built in the late 1970s. Also, the operations of the state-owned nuclear facilities started at the beginning of 1980.

In October 2020, Energoatom also signed a memorandum with a subsidiary of crypto mining giant Bitfury. With the new data center, local media outlets believe Bitfury miners could move their operations into the power plant’s facilities.

Ukraine’s Interest Towards Building Crypto Mining Data Centers in Nuclear Plants

The deal between Energoatom and Kyiv Energy Construction Company is not a surprising move. In fact, the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine asked Energoatom in May 2020 to conduct research to assess crypto mining’s feasibility at their nuclear plants.

As an anecdotal fact in terms of crypto mining in Ukrainian nuclear plants, the nation’s Security Service found illegal crypto mining equipment in a nuclear power plant in 2019.

The installation’s illegal mining rigs were found in the Southern region of Ukraine. Moreover, the investigations determined that such illegal equipment breached a “state secret.”

The San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase recently announced the company plans to do a direct listing, as opposed to following the initial public offering (IPO) route. The decision means that Coinbase can float its shares on an exchange without hiring a financial institution to underwrite the settlements.

Coinbase to Skip IPO Process, Shoots for a Direct Listing

Just recently people familiar with the matter received a tip that the exchange giant Coinbase had plans to sell shares privately ahead of the IPO. In mid-December, Coinbase revealed the confidential filing of an S-1 initial public offering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

However, on January 28, 2021, Coinbase announced a proposed direct listing as opposed to the IPO that was initially planned. For instance, a few weeks prior rumors spread that Goldman Sachs would be the exchange’s underwriter.

On Thursday Coinbase wrote:

Coinbase Global, Inc. today announced its intent to become a publicly-traded company pursuant to a proposed direct listing of its Class A common stock. Such proposed listing is expected to be pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Crypto Proponents See ‘Strong Market Demand’ for Coinbase Shares

Of course, the crypto community started speculating on why Coinbase decided to opt for a direct listing instead of an IPO. James Todaro, MD, partner at Greymatter Capital explained a few reasons why he thinks Coinbase chose this path.

“Possible key reasons,” Todaro tweeted. “Strong market demand/no help needed generating liquidity, [and] no lock-up for early investors (can sell shares immediately). I think early investors see imminent market euphoria,” Todaro added.

Moreover, a direct listing seems to be the popular route these days to some companies rather than IPO. The popular video game company Roblox opted to choose a direct listing and several others are choosing to debut on public equity markets.

Coinbase will be able to jump over the components of an IPO by floating shares without any intermediaries. The San Francisco-based crypto company can sell shares directly to the public without dealing with marketing new equity and the need for investment banks to underwrite transactions.

As bitcoin struggles to kickstart yet another record-breaking rally, Scott Minerd, the CIO at Guggenheim Investments says this could be down to the inadequate institutional support. According to Minerd’s assessment, this lack of sufficient institutional investor support means it will be hard for bitcoin to trade above $30,000.

The CIO, however, thinks the viability of the crypto as “an asset class is still very likely.” In a short video, Minerd chronicles bitcoin’s rise and how the crypto initially did not have a large enough market capitalization to attract institutions.

However, after the crypto rose to $10,000, perceptions changed. The CIO explains:

When we had bitcoin at $10,000, it was pretty easy to see that there was a clear path to $20,000.Once it went past $20,000 you could definitely see based on technical work how you could get to $35,000 or even higher.

Minerd, who has previously predicted a maximum price of $400,000 for the BTC, says the current investor base is not big enough to support a valuation above $30,000.

Not Everyone Agrees

However, not everyone agrees that bitcoin, which grew by more than 300% in 2020, will remain stuck at current prices. Michael Geiger, the CEO at a financial brokerage firm Libertex, disagrees with Minerd’s view. Geiger explains to News.bitcoin.com that “an overextension does not mean that bitcoin would permanently stay below the figure.” The CEO adds:

Eventually, bitcoin would move above the figure even in the lower part of the logarithmic regression band, provided that the asset still holds any meaningful value.

Meanwhile, despite Minerd’s comments, bitcoin has dropped below $30,000 only twice since January 1, 2020. At the time of writing, the crypto appears to have resumed its rally after it went past $37k handle for the first time since January 20.

Do you agree with Minerd’s prediction that BTC will struggle to stay above $30,000? You can tell us what you think in the comments section below.

The infamous meme token dogecoin has been skyrocketing in value rising more than 325.21% during the last 24 hours. After remaining below a U.S. cent for years, the humorous crypto asset is now exchanging hands for $0.05 per unit. The reason behind the big dogecoin price spike is similar to the recent Gamestop/Wallstreetbets story as a Reddit group called Satoshistreetbets has been behind the recent pump.

In April 2019, the Tesla founder Elon Musk said dogecoin (DOGE) was his “fav cryptocurrency.” In June 2020, day traders from Tiktok decided to encourage people to buy dogecoin in order to get the price per unit up to a dollar. The dollar price per DOGE never came to fruition, but the crypto asset saw some significant gains from the pump. Then during the first week of January 2021, news.Bitcoin.com reported on dogecoin gathering well over 500% gains during the year.

Now the K-9 crypto asset is making headlines again as the price has been surging during the last 24 hours. DOGE is currently swapping for 5 U.S. cents after trading below a penny for quite some time. The digital asset has a whopping $4.83 billion in global trade volume today and the asset is well above the all-time high (ATH) it captured in 2017.

Weekly stats show dogecoin is up over 585% and during the last 30 days DOGE is up over 1,150%. Against bitcoin (BTC), dogecoin has gained a colossal 871% against the leading crypto asset. Moreover, during the last 12 months, dogecoin has jumped in value by over 2,270%.

Okay I caved and bought the dog stocks lmaoooooo — Mia K. (@miakhalifa) January 29, 2021

Rumor has it the dogecoin (DOGE) pump was started by the Redditors from r/satoshistreetbets who have been following the recent action spurred by the Gamestop/Wallstreetbets fiasco.

One particular thread talks about holding dogecoin in order to get the price per unit to $10. The Reddit post which is on the front page has over 11,000 upvotes has a lot of participants and people have been discussing the best exchanges to utilize.

Then on Thursday, the popular Elon Musk decided to tweet a meme of a magazine called “Dogue,” which is a play on the “Vogue” magazine title. Moreover, the Onlyfans star, Mia Khalifa, tweeted about the dogecoin madness on Twitter to her 3.4 million followers.

The tweet from Musk got the dogecoin crowd excited and one individual tweeted a meme that featured Musk, a bunch of cartoon Doges, and said: “DOGE is the answer.” Dogecoin is also one of the only older coins, besides BTC and ETH, that has managed to surpass its ATH from 2017, while many other older crypto assets have yet to do so.

Dogecoin is over seven years old and was developed by Jackson Palmer and the programmer Billy Markus. The digital currency’s existence has always been to exist for fun, promote laughter, and reach a broader demographic. It has managed to do so and stay in the limelight, as the asset is now holding the 11th position among the top crypto market caps.

The cryptocurrency featuring the likeness of the Shiba Inu dog has 127.7 billion DOGE in circulation. Since the recent price spike, crypto supporters have been hunting for their old dogecoin wallets as the asset is far more valuable today.

What do you think about dogecoin’s meteoric rise during the last year and the gains seen over the last week? Let us know what you think about this subject in the comments section below.

Another class-action lawsuit has been filed against Ripple Labs and CEO Brad Garlinghouse. This lawsuit follows the one filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleging that the defendants sold XRP, which it considers unregistered security, for over $1.38 billion.

The lawsuit, filed Monday in a Florida district court alleges that the “sale of XRP cryptocurrency tokens to Florida residents” violates Florida securities laws.

The suit names Ripple Lab Inc., XRP II LLC, and Garlinghouse as the defendants. They have allegedly sold “millions of dollars (or more)” in XRP tokens since 2013 without registering either with federal or Florida authorities.

Recently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs, Garlinghouse, and co-founder Christian Larsen alleging that they sold over 14.6 billion units of XRP for at least $1.38 billion. After the SEC’s lawsuit, several major cryptocurrency exchanges delisted XRP, including Coinbase, Binance, Okcoin, and Blockchain.com. Ripple has insisted that XRP is not a security and plans to fight the SEC charges.

The plaintiff, Tyler Toomey, said he purchased 135 XRP on or around Nov. 24, 2020, for $97.80 and then sold the coins at a loss. The lawsuit states that the “plaintiff sustained a loss of $48.56, or just over 50% of his initial investment.)” Although the plaintiff’s own loss is small, he “seeks to represent a class defined as all persons or entities in the State of Florida who purchased XRP.”

Toomey is seeking monetary compensation including “reasonable” attorney’s fees, expenses, and costs of the suit, on his own behalf and on behalf of other class members.

PRESS RELEASE. PARSIQ, a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform connecting on-chain and off-chain applications in real-time, announced that its PRQ token is now listed on OKEx with USDT base pair.

Please take note of the following go-live schedule:

PRQ Deposit : 07:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Spot Trading : PRQ / USDT : 10:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Withdrawal : 10:00 January 29, 2021 (UTC)

PARSIQ is a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform that serves as a multi-level bridge between blockchains and off-chain applications. PARSIQ’s features automate the blockchain analytics and monitoring process, providing customizable workflows with real-time intelligence.

Developers and individual users can transform the blockchain data to their favorite off-chain application or web service.

Among the obvious use cases is monitoring the wallets of traders and ordinary users. Among the non-obvious are complex system integrations for financial institutions and DeFi projects that use the PARSIQ infrastructure to improve security, conduct audits, comply with regulatory requirements, AML, and expand their workflows in other ways.

The infrastructure underneath PARSIQ’s user interface is built with their proprietary programming language ParsiQL, and its users’ benefits are multiplying with each supported integration.

PRQ Token

PARSIQ Token (PRQ) is an essential piece of the PARSIQ platform that co-exists with FIAT payments for using its services. Payments within the platform that are made in PRQ tokens guarantee a discounted rate. During the first Epoch when PRQ tokens are used as payment for running Smart-Triggers users receive higher execution limits, unlock transport methods, and are able to propose features that can be added to the platform.

In October 2020, the PARSIQ team released plans for Epoch 2.0.

#1. Public Projects

With Public Projects users can subscribe to existing PARSIQ Projects that were pre-made by other users. By paying in PRQ, users that have subscribed to the Public Project will incentivize the creators to create interesting, complex, and more important – problem-solving projects.

#2. User Data and PRQ

Every single monitoring target (primitive of type address, a struct with the field of address type, table row) would require 1 PRQ to hold after the implementation. It means that if there are 1000 addresses (960 in the table as rows, 30 as primitives, 10 in the structs) then the User would need 1000 PRQ on the connected Ethereum Account balance.

#3. IQ Protocol

IQ Protocol will allow risk-free PRQ lending and collateral-less borrowing. Risk-free PRQ lending means that PRQ is not transferred from the lender’s address to the borrower’s address. Details on the algorithm are available in the dedicated explainer on PARSIQ’s blog.

#4. PRQBoost

PRQ Boost is a liquidity boost program to incentivize PRQ/ETH liquidity providers on Uniswap, which goes with the PRQBOOST utility tokens to increase rewards for liquidity providers.

PARSIQ is actively working to partner with major layer 1 blockchain protocols to expand the range of blockchain integrations and give projects that build on those protocols the ability to monitor and automate workflows between blockchain and off-chain.

2021-01-29 11:30:02+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/yfxhd.jpg,"YFX.Com - DEX That Offers 100x Trading Leverage on Perpetual Contracts

PRESS RELEASE. YFX, the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts has just launched, adding an important piece to the DeFi money legos, and creating a direct competition against CEX on derivatives trading.

The most traded Bitcoin product in centralized exchanges is Bitcoin futures, which is 10 times bigger than spot trading in terms of the trading volume. But in DEX, spot trading platforms like Uniswap are occupying a large portion of the total trading volume, and there is not a single decentralized futures trading platform that could reach even 1/10 of Uniswap’s trading volume. What stops decentralized futures trading platforms from becoming 10 times bigger than Uniswap? Why are decentralized futures trading platforms performing worse than their centralized counterparts?

The main reason is that decentralized futures exchanges don’t currently provide an attractive futures product to compete with centralized futures exchanges. For instance, centralized futures exchanges like BitMex can provide 100x leverage on Bitcoin futures trading. On the other hand, decentralized futures exchanges like dYdX only offer 10x leverage. None of the decentralized exchanges can keep up with the 100x leverage offering from centralized exchanges.

YFX Descartes V1 uses QIC-AMM and a system de-risk mechanism to migrate perpetual futures trading from CEX to DEX without reducing the trading leverage, which makes YFX the first DEX that could offer 100x leverage on a perpetual contract. You can do everything on YFX that you can do on BitMex or OKEx. YFX is poised to compete directly against established centralized exchanges. YFX Descartes V1 runs on the TRON MainNet, for faster transaction times and cheaper gas fees compared to Ethereum. The YFX team is also working on Ethereum’s Layer 2 solution to provide pragmatic perpetual trading on DEX. YFX team plans to launch their DEX on Huobi Heco and Ethereum Test net in Q1, 2021.

About YFX

YFX is the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts. YFX Descartes V1 launched on the TRON MainNet, and all trades are held and processed by smart contracts. The main goal of the YFX team, which is formed by a group of engineers who have years of experience working on trading systems and blockchain, is to build a DEX that can compete with CEX on derivative trading.

PRESS RELEASE. Lendefi is a brand-new protocol aiming to provide opportunities such as lending and borrowing, leveraging and investing.

Lendefi is an innovative second-generation DeFi lending protocol that allows lenders to earn interest on stablecoin deposits, and for borrowers to obtain undercollateralized loans (UCLs) to invest in popular digital assets.

The main advantage of Lendefi is the possibility of undercollateralized loans, meaning you can borrow more than the collateral (serving as a type of security) you provide. Existing lending protocols, for their part, allow overcollateralized loans, meaning users are limited to less than the value of the collateral when borrowing. The example scenarios below illustrates the difference.

• Undercollateralized: You can provide collateral worth 50,000 USD and borrow another asset worth more than 50,000 USD.

• Overcollateralized: You can provide collateral worth 50,000 USD and borrow another asset worth less than 50,000 USD.

With undercollateralized lending, the borrower can leverage their available capital while pursuing investment opportunities that would previously have been beyond reach. Clearly, this will make digital assets more intriguing to investors accustomed to accessing such mechanisms in traditional markets.

Lendefi vs Compound

Undercollateralized borrowing being the primary point of divergence as compared to other lending protocols, the mechanism of ensuring both parties’ trust is different. While Compound allows loaned assets to be withdrawn, and thus requires overcollateralization to protect the lender from default, Lendefi keeps the collateral escrowed within the protocol.

While the interest rate offered by Compound is variable, Lendefi provides a fixed rate for borrowers and keeps it variable for lenders. Interest rates will be updated periodically by the DAO. Because the costs for borrowing are predictable, and thus easier to integrate into risk management processes or trade calculations than variable rates, borrowers are likely to find Lendefi attractive.

Interoperability

The interoperability of Compound and Lendefi gives users the option to borrow with a wide range of assets. For example, a borrower could utilize Compound to obtain an overcollateralized loan for USDC using BAT as collateral, then use USDC on Lendefi to take out an under-collateralized loan to invest in wBTC. This interoperability may become deployed as a third-generation protocol itself.

Similarities

While the mechanism of ensuring trust between borrowers and lenders varies between Compound and Lendefi, they are based on the same governance principles and restriction to popular assets.

Governance model

Both protocols are governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) which enables complete community and stakeholder control of the protocol.

Restricted to popular digital assets

Both protocols are restricted to popular digital assets. In the case of Lendefi, the selection is based on Uniswap liquidity, and further digital assets can be added as per the decision of the Lendefi DAO, as with Compound’s DAO.

Lendefi is a game-changer

Every protocol provides different use cases. By enabling lenders to earn interest on stablecoin deposits, and giving borrowers access to attractive undercollateralized loans, Lendefi can make a major splash in a rapidly expanding industry.

In collaboration with Bulgarian authorities, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) disrupted a well-known ransomware gang’s infrastructure. Law enforcement seized their servers and traced the illicit funds with the help of blockchain forensic analytics via Chainalysis.

US Authorities Seized Over $454,000 Worth of Cryptocurrencies

Per the U.S. Department of Justice’s announcement, the coordinated action took down Netwalker, a highly active ransomware group over the last year, specifically targeting the health care sector.

The U.S. authorities also indicted a Canadian national, Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins, who allegedly obtained $27.6 million as a “Netwalker affiliate.”

The authorities seized a server that hosted their site on the dark web, where the gang redirected their victims to arrange the ransom negotiations. Moreover, the U.S. DOJ said that $454,530.19 in cryptocurrency from ransom payments were seized.

With the support of blockchain analysis, law enforcement took advantage of investigative tools of Chainalysis to trace Netwalker transactions. In fact, the blockchain firm had traced more than $46 million worth of funds in Netwalker ransoms since it first came on the scene in August 2019.

The U.S. authorities believe the ransomware gang targeted 205 victims from 27 different countries during its lifetime, including 203 in the U.S.

Speaking with news.Bitcoin.com, Brett Callow, threat analyst at malware lab Emsisoft, commented on the authorities’ action against Netwalker:

Ransomware groups have operated with almost complete impunity for a very long time, which means there’s very little deterrent. The rewards are enormous, while the risks are small. The action against Netwalker changes that. In addition to disrupting the group’s revenue stream, it also sends a clear message that cybercriminals are not beyond the reach of the law. Will that create a deterrent? No, but it’s certainly a step in the right direction.

Netwalker ransomware works with an affiliate scheme, where external people could deploy the ransomware and share revenues with the gang. Chainalysis elaborates on what the blockchain analysis unveiled about the infrastructure:

Typically, there are four roles that receive proceeds from Netwalker attacks: the likely administrator or developer (8-10%), the affiliate (76-80%), and two commissioned roles (2.5%-5% each). An affiliate, like Vachon-Desjardins, is usually responsible for obtaining access to the victim network and deploying the malware. There are also cases when one wallet gets 100% of the payment, which we believe belongs to the Netwalker administrator and indicates that he or she may also be directly involved in some of the attacks.

The analytical firm says that there were fewer than 20 unique affiliates. Some of them rarely deployed the ransomware, while others moved on to other similar ransomware strains. That’s why a tool used by the authorities named Chainalysis Reactor traced payments received by the affiliates from other variants.

To confirm the fact that some affiliates moved to other strains, Chainalysis found out that Netwalker administrator published an advertisement on darknet forums. The admin was seeking new affiliates, as vacancies “had freed up.”

Tracing Suspected Netwalker Affiliate

On how the authorities traced Vachon-Desjardins’ activities, Chainalysis explained:

Blockchain analysis revealed at least 345 addresses associated with Vachon-Desjardins going back to February 2018 with transactions continuing to the date of this writing (January 27, 2021). He allegedly received more than $14 million worth of bitcoin at the time of receipt of the funds, ultimately possessing at least $27.6 million given its rising value.

Citing government partners, Chainalysis claims Vachon-Desjardins was involved in at least 91 attacks using Netwalker ransomware since April 2020, deploying the malware as an affiliate and receiving 80% of the ransom. The analytical firm also suspects the alleged Netwalker affiliate was involved in the deployment of other ransomware strains.

The exchange-traded fund provider, Vaneck has filed for a Digital Asset ETF, which aims to hold equity in companies that generate revenue from cryptocurrency services. The latest ETF filing is different from the fund Vaneck applied for in mid-December, as it aims to bring investors exposure to the cryptocurrency industry.

Last December, the asset manager, and ETF provider Vaneck filed for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This was after the firm launched a bitcoin exchange-traded note called the “Vaneck Vector Bitcoin ETN” on Deutsche Böerse Xetra. Following these two actions, recent filings show that Vaneck wants to produce another fund called the “Digital Asset ETF.” The Digital Asset ETF registration was sent to the SEC on Thursday, January 21, 2021.

Essentially the Digital Asset ETF will allow investors to gain exposure to companies offering goods and services within the crypto industry. The fund will hold equity in companies that generate at least 50% of revenues from the cryptocurrency and blockchain economy. The New York-based fund issuer’s ETF registration form says the fund “seeks to track as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the price and yield performance of the MVIS Global Digital Assets Equity Index.” The firm’s ETF filing also details exactly what type of companies the Digital Asset ETF may include.

“Digital asset companies may include small- and medium-capitalization companies and foreign and emerging market issuers, and the fund may invest in depositary receipts and securities denominated in foreign currencies,” Vaneck’s filing notes. This particular ETF registration is aiming at retail investors in contrast to targeting a limited number of accredited investors.

The latest Vaneck news about the Digital Asset ETF follows the company’s recent issues with former partner Solidx. The law newsdesk law360 reported that the blockchain startup Solidx has accused Vaneck of breach of contract. According to the report, after Vaneck severed its relationship with Solidx, it allegedly leveraged the company’s technology.

The latest Digital Asset ETF registration also mentions that Vaneck’s fund can invest in firms that hold a balance of digital currencies like the firm Microstrategy. Additionally, the fund describes companies with exposure to crypto-assets can represent firms like exchanges, mining operators, crypto custodians, and more.

A U.S. court has sentenced Jerry Ji Guo, a resident of San Francisco, to an effective six months in prison for his role in a fraudulent initial coin offering (ICO). In addition to the prison term, the court ordered Guo to pay over $4 million in restitution. Further, Guo will also cooperate with the government in the identification and return of the stolen property.

Embezzlement of Client Funds

In a statement, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) says Guo, who pleaded guilty on August 26, 2019, had presented himself “as an ICO consultant and promised his clients he would perform marketing and publicity services.” However, instead of fulfilling his promises, Guo “embezzled the clients’ cash and cryptocurrency.”

As court documents show, a U.S. grand jury initially indicted Guo on November 15, 2018, charging him with “eight counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343.” However, the statement says Guo only pleaded guilty to one count while the rest of the charges were dismissed.

Victim Compensation

Meanwhile, in his remarks, the United States Attorney David L. Anderson, suggests that the country’s law enforcement has now caught up with crypto criminals. He says:

Some criminals believe mistakenly that cryptocurrency is beyond the reach of law enforcement. This case shows we can use criminal forfeiture to compensate fraud victims even when cryptocurrency is used in the fraud.

According to the DOJ statement, after Guo’s indictment, the government went on to obtain a “stipulated application for a preliminary order of forfeiture” on November 14, 2019. Further, the government also obtained warrants to seize the stolen cash and cryptocurrency while a “final order of forfeiture against the stolen property” was obtained on February 26, 2020.

In the meantime, the DOJ statement goes on to say that the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, a component of the DOJ’s Criminal Division “will use the victim restoration process to return stolen property to victims.”

With Argentineans facing rising inflation to near 40%, solutions appear to contain the impact on national farmers. A business blockchain platform is partnering with a peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace to launch a program to tokenize Argentina’s agriculture.

More Than 40% of the World’s Soybean Oil and Soy-Meal Production Comes From Argentina

According to an announcement shared with news.Bitcoin.com, Coreledger will work with Abakus to set up a “digital barter economy” in Argentina.

The project consists of enabling farmers to tokenize their agricultural assets to seek a hedge against rising inflation. It can be possible by accessing liquidity via certified titles through national and international investors, said Coreledger.

Argentinean farmers could redeem and trade their tokenized titles with any other asset through the Akabus P2P platform. Coreledger puts soybeans as an example, as it can work like an asset-backed currency, tradeable for other commodities or even the fiat peso.

Johannes Schweifer, CEO of CoreLedger, commented on the farmers’ struggling with a plummeting fiat peso amidst pandemic uncertainties:

More than 40% of the world’s soybean oil and soy-meal production comes from Argentina, meaning it is of great national interest that smallholder farmers can liquify these assets. In an inflation-stricken country, access to physically-backed assets can be the difference between surviving and thriving for these farmers.

Also, Martin Furst, CEO of Abakus, believes the tokenization of agricultural assets brings “greater agency to farmers who can now sell the physical-backed assets according to their own needs.” Coreledger clarified that tokens become “true stable coins, backed by real assets, not unstable fiat currencies.”

Bitcoin Keeps Going Through the Roof as Economic Troubles Worsens in Argentina

The plan is to oversee how the project works within the Argentinean economic conditions’ environment. After assessing the results, Coreledger expects to expand the tokenized agriculture concept into other developing countries.

With a currency that faces economic troubles, inflationary turmoil, oversized emissions, and hopeless forecasts from experts, bitcoin (BTC) has been having enough room to surge in Argentina. Over the last year, BTC prices crossed the 1,594,000 threshold against the Argentinean peso.

A U.S. cryptocurrency miner installed a mining rig in a particular place with the motivation to “annoy gamers.” Simon Byrne installed the full infrastructure in the back of his BMW i8 hybrid car.

Miner Is Trying to Create a ‘Crypto Utopia’

According to PC Gamer, Byrne fit six Nvidia RTX 3080s graphic cards into the trunk of his car. The hybrid car’s internal battery provides the hardware power.

However, the car’s boot should remain open, or the whole mining rig setup will overheat, said the cryptocurrency miner. Hardware Times first spotted the BMW’s mining rig, who estimated that the car is worth $147,500 at the time it was acquired.

The electric vehicle is capable of accelerating to 100 kilometers per hour in just 4.4 seconds. Per Hardware Times’ report, the mining system is powered by an ASUS B250 Mining Expert board and an EVGA SuperNOVA 1600 T2 power supply.

Byrne claimed that he didn’t build the mining rig just for practical purposes. He just wanted to “annoy gamers.”

The miner says he is attempting to build a crypto “utopia” with the mining rig into his BMW i8. However, he didn’t elaborate on further details, said PC Gamer.

Byrne told Hardware Times that he owns another mining farm composed of 78 Geforce RTX 3080 graphics cards. The setup is capable of generating over $128,088 per year in profits. Photos show that the BMW i8 car has a Nevada license plate with “HODLER” highlighted on it.

Other Interesting Cases of Crypto Mining Setups

But this is not the first curious case of a crypto mining-related setup in the world. For instance, the concept of “cryptomatoes” born in March 2018. Kamil Brejcha, co-founder of the exchange Nakamoto X, published photos of tomatoes grown using excess heat from cryptocurrency miners.

The method aimed to channel the excess heat from the crypto mining for tomatoes’ sustenance, among other solutions. Brejcha wanted to point out that entrepreneurs could compile environmental-friendly methods into an “agriculture blockchain startup.”

Other rare uses for bitcoin (BTC) mining are found in the United States – specifically in Florida. During an interview with news.Bitcoin.com, electrical and computer engineering graduate of Cornell, Avi Aisenberg, said he acquired three Antminers and placed them in a distillery he owns.

The small mining setup goal was to take advantage of the 4000 W of exhaust heat to cycle his rum barrels’ temperature to accelerate the aging process. Of course, these types of cogeneration mining concepts are probably more useful to some observers than a BMW i8 hybrid car with a crypto miner built to simply “annoy gamers.”

The blockchain gaming platform, Enjin and Metaverseme, an augmented reality (AR) platform are set to introduce tradeable AR fashion assets to the Ethereum blockchain. The Enjin-powered non-fungible token (NFT), which can be worn by users’ avatars in the Metaverseme app, will launch on February 23.

Revolutionary Apps and Games

According to a statement, the Metaverseme app will allow users to quickly snap selfies in the real world and generate hyper-realistic avatars. The AR mode maps users’ real-world environment, where their digital avatars can be brought to life as they wear and interact with their NFT fashion. Users can then record their avatar wearing fashion NFTs in AR and share the videos via social media.

In his remarks following this announcement, Martyn Hughes, a founder at Metaverseme, talks up the importance and potential of blockchain technology. He says:

It won’t be long before blockchain is recognized as the internet of value for all immersive experiences. Being able to take your assets and use them across all of your favourite games and apps will revolutionize the digital economy.

New Possibilities

Meanwhile, in their statement, the two entities explain that “the first NFTs that Metaverseme will adopt is a collection called Pluriform, a limited run of digital-only fashion items created through an ongoing partnership between Enjin, Atari, Metaverseme, and the Fabricant. The Pluriform NFTs will be available till February 28, and “all [the] unsold supply will be burned at the end of the sale.”

For his part, Enjin CEO Maxim Blagov praises the possibilities that arise from the combination of the blockchain and AR. He says:

Soon, your likeness will be able to ascend across the entire internet, and we’re excited to work with the Metaverseme team to make this happen.

Since joining Enjin, Atari and other game developers have locked over 10 million Enjin tokens inside high-functioning NFTs including those that can be used in Metaverseme.

One of the most popular privacy-centric messaging applications Signal has seen explosive growth during the last two months over things like the Whatsapp acquisition and the recent Big Tech censorship. According to a number of reports, the company has been experimenting with monetization and more recently Signal has been reportedly testing the crypto network Stellar.

The mobile company called App Annie detailed at the end of 2020, Signal had around 20 million active users a month. Following the announcement that Facebook was acquiring Whatsapp and changing its privacy terms, there’s been a mass exodus toward privacy-centric messaging apps like Telegram and Signal.

News.Bitcoin.com reported on Telegram’s colossal growth recently surpassing 500 million active users. Data from Sensor Tower details that alongside Telegram’s swelling, Signal saw the privacy messaging app downloaded 7.5 million times in four days between January 6 and January 10.

A few reports this week have disclosed that Signal is experimenting with cryptocurrencies and may even introduce its own coin. The tech newsletter called Platformer said that Signal was toying with a Stellar derivative called Mobilecoin, which is a token built using the Stellar blockchain.

Moxie Marlinspike the CEO of Signal, was once an advisor for the Mobilecoin project. However, according to the recent Platform report, Signal employees are leery of adding a cryptocurrency and have said that it could cause unwanted regulatory scrutiny.

For instance, Telegram had regulatory issues with the U.S. SEC after creating its own cryptocurrency and Facebook’s digital asset was also scrutinized heavily. Other messaging apps like China’s Wechat already leverages crypto asset payments. Still, a few employees and former Signal staff members are not impressed by the move.

“The world needs products like Signal but they also need Signal to be thoughtful,” Gregg Bernstein, a former Signal researcher explained to the Platformer.

At press time, stellar (XLM) is the 12th largest blockchain in terms of market cap, and is swapping for $0.24 per unit on Wednesday. Data from Coingecko shows that mobilecoin (MOB) token is exchanging hands for $3.55 per unit, and is up 12% today while most coins are down.

There’s currently $1.3 million in 24-hour MOB global trade volume today with FTX Exchange’s MOB/USDT and MOB/USD markets dominating.
