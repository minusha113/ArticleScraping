CHAPTER ONE: Listening to the Past

“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.” — Satoshi Nakamoto

The trusted third party problem has haunted modern financial systems and centralized exchanges because people require an intermediary to make them work. The third party’s good or bad motives become a defining aspect of the transaction, and the those who use the institutions are at the mercy of those intentions. This is especially true of the current system of state-issued money and central banking.

A trustless system avoids intermediaries and does not depend upon the intentions of participants; that is, the system functions in the same manner regardless of anyone’s intentions. The blockchain, with a transparent and immutable peer-to peer protocol, is called trustless because there is no corruptible intermediary upon whom exchanges must depend.

On a small scale, the trusted third party problem may always exist because a middleman is useful or necessary in some situations. If third parties offer competitive services on a free market, however, the damage of dishonesty or incompetence is limited. People can take their business elsewhere, report a swindler to watchdogs, warn others, and file a lawsuit.

An occasionally dishonest third party is not the problem Satoshi addresses. He speaks to the institutionalized corruption of government and central banks from which the average person could not escape by using a competitor or by suing. Almost everyone who works over the table, runs a business, buys or sells goods, accepts government benefits or pays taxes has had to accept a fiat that constantly plunges in value due to inflation. Almost everyone who uses credit, accepts checks, takes out loans, conducts commerce or does business abroad has needed to go through banks that steal like drunken muggers.

For average people, the situation used to seem hopeless because no legal, practical, and private alternative existed for transferring funds across considerable distance, including borders. Attempts to reform or remove the system also seemed doomed because it was inherently corrupt and self-serving. In fact, fiat and central banking were serving the purpose for which they had been established: financial control by elites. People’s need for money and exchange became their straitjackets.

Then Satoshi. Then the blockchain and crypto. A new concept of money was created in a form that cannot not be inflated; the number of bitcoins is fixed at 21 million divisible units. The supply can only decrease when coins are lost, as inevitably happens. Satoshi notes, “Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.” Bitcoin solved the fiat problem.

A new concept of financial transfer solved the third party problem, especially with regard to banks. Although peer-to-peer transactions involve a middleman or miner, no trust is required since the transaction is released only when “proof of work” is rendered, which consists of solving a complicated math problem. Arriving at a solution may be costly in computer power and time, but the solutions themselves are easy to verify. Satoshi comments, “With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.” The soundness and propriety of the blockchain’s protocol itself is assured by the use of open source that is visible to all and verifiable. The political outcome: A private currency and method of exchange freed people from financial oppression.

The idea of private currency itself is hardly new, however.

Precedent in Radical Individualist Theory

The late Friedrich Hayek is the most respected Austrian economist of the 20th century. His book The Denationalisation of Money: An Analysis of the Theory and Practice of Concurrent Currencies argues vigorously for private and competitive currencies to displace government-issued ones. Hayek ponders a key question. “When one studies the history of money one cannot help wondering why people should have put up for so long with governments exercising an exclusive power over two thousand years that was regularly used to exploit and defraud them. This can be explained only by the myth” that government money was necessary “becoming so firmly established that it did not occur even to the professional students of these matters…ever to question it. But once the validity of the established doctrine is doubted its foundation is rapidly seen to be fragile.”

Governments reap incredible profits from debasing the currency, but the rigged game works only if people have no alternative but to play it. The political purpose of legal tender and banking laws is to grant a monopoly to the state, which permits the redistribution of wealth and power from average people upward to the elite of society. Fiat money and banking remains fragile, however, because the system relies on people either not understanding the dynamics or not having a choice. Hayek wonders why public understanding is so elusive. Why was “a government monopoly of the provision of money…universally regarded as indispensable” and what would happen “if the provision of money were thrown open to the competition of private concerns supplying different currencies?”

With eerie prescience, Hayek argues for currencies developed by entrepreneurs who innovate new forms of money just as they innovate in other areas. One of the drawbacks of government’s monopoly is that it imposes a freeze on the sort of invention that now runs free in crypto. The voluntaryist historian Carl Watner observes, “No one can tell in advance what form these monies might take because no one can know for sure what choices individuals would make or what new technologies might be discovered. Laws forcing people to use the Federal Reserve System money have frozen monetary developments at a certain stage…Just imagine if Congress had protected the Post Office by passing laws that would have prevented people from communicating via the internet. We would never have experienced the marvels of e-mail.”

The late Austrian economist Murray Rothbard also wrestles with the question of “why do people so vigorously resist private currencies?” His book For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto advances an explanation. “If the government and only the government had had a monopoly of the shoe manufacturing and retailing business, how would most of the public treat the libertarian who now came along to advocate that the government get out of the shoe business and throw it open to private enterprise?” Rothbard predicts that the skeptics would attack the libertarian for depriving them of the only possible source of shoes—the government. People are thoroughly indoctrinated to believe that daily life cannot function without the state and fiat.

Hayek and Rothbard are unusual among free-market economists in their embrace of private money and monetary systems. Even laissez-faire zealots rarely champion free-market currencies or private banking. Instead, they debate marginal issues such as fractional reserve and other reforms they think will improve the existing system. Or they argue for the restoration of a gold standard as though it were a panacea. But if a gold standard were applied to fiat, the system would still require people to trust the government and banks. This means trusting both institutions to act against their own interests, which they have historically neglected to do.

The modern neglect of free-market money and banking is odd because 19th century radical individualists focused intensely on the importance of private money and private banking to personal freedom. They placed a primal emphasis on the right of every individual to create his own currency and to function as his own bank. It was a natural right as important as freedom of speech or of religion. The pivotal individualist Benjamin Tucker believed that the right to issue private currency was so important that it could destroy the State all by itself. His reasoning: The money monopoly, including control of credit, was how the State sustained itself and robbed average people not merely of wealth but also of economic opportunity.

Two specific events sculpted the approach that the early individualist-anarchists adopted toward the monetary monopoly. One was the Panic of 1837 that tipped the United States into recession until the mid-1840s. Commonly cited causes of the Panic include a collapsing land bubble and a sharp fall in cotton prices. Blame is also placed at the feet of President Andrew Jackson for vetoing the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States and precipitating an unfortunate chain of economic events. Drawing on the work of Professor of Economics Peter Temin, Rothbard disputes this interpretation.

First, he [Temin] points out that the price inflation really began earlier, when wholesale prices reached a trough of 82 in July 1830 and then rose by 20.7 percent in three years to reach 99 in the fall of 1833. The reason for the price rise is simple: The total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $159 million in 1833, an increase of 45.9 percent, or an annual rise of 15.3 percent. Breaking the figures down further, the total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $155 million a year and a half later, a spectacular expansion of 35 percent. Unquestionably, this monetary expansion was spurred by the still-flourishing Bank of the United States, which increased its notes and deposits from January 1830 to January 1832 from a total of $29 million to $42.1 million, a rise of 45.2 percent. Thus, the price and money inflation in the first few years of the 1830s were again sparked by the expansion of the still-dominant central bank.

Arguably, the Panic began in May 1837 when banks in New York City announced they would not redeem commercial paper for specie at full face value. Of the approximately 800 banks in America, all but six ceased at one point or another to redeem banknotes and deposits for gold or silver coins. Suspicion and hatred of traditional banks and government-issued money soared, with radicals scrutinizing alternate systems.

The other event dramatically to impact the radical fever from monetary reform was the Civil War for which the North financed its fighting through Legal Tender Acts and the National Banking Act of 1863.

The radicals did not merely theorize; they experimented with private currencies and new economic models. Their efforts are fascinating, but they are also cautionary tales. A major problem for 19th-century individualist-anarchism was the movement’s general acceptance of a link between sound money and the labor theory of value. This theory states that the true value of a good or service is based on the labor required to produce it rather than the price at which a seller and buyer are willing to exchange. In short, a good has intrinsic and not subjective value. (More on this in the section on the Regression Theorem.) Happily, their main economic goal was the abolition of the “money monopoly.” The term referred to three different but interacting forms of monopoly: banking, the charging of interest, and the privileged issuance of currency. The abolition of state power over currency was the focus, and they eschewed the use of force to implement their own schemes.

Josiah Warren provided a real-world example of what was meant by a currency that rested on the labor theory of value. Credited with being the first American anarchist, Warren tested his specific solution to the money monopoly through a Time Store from which he issued “Labor Notes.” In 1827, the business opened with $300 worth of groceries and dry goods that were offered at a 7 percent markup from Warren’s own costs in order to cover expenses such as overhead. This was before groceries were prepackaged or preweighed, and it was usual for buyers to bargain with the shopkeeper rather than pay a posted price. One of

Warren’s innovations was to post prices, which drove costs lower because transactions consumed less time. The customer paid in traditional money for the goods and paid with a Labor Note to compensate Warren for his time. The Labor Note obliged the customer to provide Warren with an equivalent amount of his time. If the buyer was a seamstress, for example, the Labor Note committed her to render to Warren X units of time to produce clothing. Warren’s goal was to establish an economy—or to establish a proof of principle, at least—in which profit was based on the exchange of time and labor. The Labor Notes were circulated and traded widely with in the community.

To some degree, Warren succeeded. People traveled from a hundred miles away to avail themselves of the Time Store’s low prices. After a few years, he declared the experiment to be a success and closed the store. Whether the Labor Notes were a success is questionable, however. The store itself may well have succeeded due to its low prices, not to the Notes. Whichever explanation is true, it is difficult to see how this novel currency could function in dense populations or on a grander scale of commerce. Few people today would be convinced of the viability of private money based on the Time Store experiment.

What could convince the public and economists that private currencies work as well or better than government-issued ones? Going back a bit further in American history is a good place to start because the future is always based on the past.

The Wall Street Bets saga, an incredibly ridiculous story about a group of amateur Reddit investors who beat career Wall Street hedge funds at their own game, is to be made into a movie.

According to a report by online news site Deadline on Jan. 31, Metro Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) won the rights to produce the film in a bidding war involving major Hollywood movie houses.

The movie is to be based on a book proposed by author Ben Mezrich. Mezrich’s previous work, “The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding Of Facebook, a Tale Of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal,” was adapted into the motion picture “The Social Network.”

The title to his planned latest book offering is called “The Antisocial Network,” said the report, quoting sources familiar with the development. The book is expected to go out to publishers later this February, it said.

However, it is not yet clear what shape or structure the movie will take. MGM’s Michael DeLuca will produce the film. DeLuca also produced the Academy-Award winning The Social Network. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss will executive produce via their Winklevoss Pictures production company.

The Wall Street Bets group noticed that major hedge funds on Wall Street had been placing short bets against companies they considered to be dying. The funds particularly targeted Gamestop, the world’s largest video game retailer, continually shorting the company’s shares.

But the Redditors saw an opportunity to make profit and collectively bet the other way, buying shares and stock options. This resulted in the value of the Gamestop shares soaring by more than 2,600% in January.

Hedge funds that had shorted the stock incurred losses running into several billions of dollars. One fund, Melvin Capital, reportedly lost up to $7 billion to the “short squeeze” in January, forcing it to restructure its investment portfolio to ensure a faster escape in future “squeezes.”

The Reddit traders also extended the pump to a few other stocks considered to be dying, including AMC (which climbed over 900% in January), as well as Nokia and Blackberry. This surge of activity resulted in a major controversy when the trading app Robinhood began restricting trade on certain stocks.

Ukraine’s government-owned nuclear power plant picked a firm to build a massive data center in Rivne for cryptocurrency mining operations. After a bidding process, Energoatom chose Kyiv Energy Construction Company to handle the nuclear plant crypto mining project.

Nuclear Power Plant Operator Expects to Launch the Data Center in 2022

According to official documents, the data center will be based in the Rivne nuclear power plant, after the construction firm got 8.92 million Hryvnia ($317,620) in funding. The only competitor in the bidding was Ukrenergobudproek. However, they allegedly made an expensive offer, said the regional news outlet Forklog.

The Kyiv Energy Construction Company expects to finish the data center building by August 31, 2022. Per the announcement, the contractor is required to send the documentation that details the whole process. It includes “host state registers, electronic archives, and computing facilities.”

In terms of technical details, the nuclear power plant has a capacity of 2,657 megawatts, and it was built in the late 1970s. Also, the operations of the state-owned nuclear facilities started at the beginning of 1980.

In October 2020, Energoatom also signed a memorandum with a subsidiary of crypto mining giant Bitfury. With the new data center, local media outlets believe Bitfury miners could move their operations into the power plant’s facilities.

Ukraine’s Interest Towards Building Crypto Mining Data Centers in Nuclear Plants

The deal between Energoatom and Kyiv Energy Construction Company is not a surprising move. In fact, the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine asked Energoatom in May 2020 to conduct research to assess crypto mining’s feasibility at their nuclear plants.

As an anecdotal fact in terms of crypto mining in Ukrainian nuclear plants, the nation’s Security Service found illegal crypto mining equipment in a nuclear power plant in 2019.

The installation’s illegal mining rigs were found in the Southern region of Ukraine. Moreover, the investigations determined that such illegal equipment breached a “state secret.”

Alongside the cryptocurrency’s meteoric climb over the back half of 2020 and early 2021, a curious phenomenon has unfolded; heightened profit-taking and conversion to fiat currencies. Data collected by Simplex, a fiat-crypto gateway, underscores this seemingly paradoxical development.

A Curious Race to Convert Crypto to Fiat Has Accompanied Bitcoin’s Latest Drive Higher

Sharing exclusive data with Bitcoin.com, Simplex cofounder and chief analytics officer Netanel Kabala says:

While the international press coverage of Bitcoin’s rally has caused a swathe of new users to flock to the industry and buy-in, outflows have been equally significant. Of the total amount of cryptocurrency sold in the last six months, 43% was off ramped in December alone.

A quick look at Google Trends for the term ‘Bitcoin’ echoes these developments, especially now that new equity instruments like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and big-name funds like Blackrock are adding exposure and raising crypto awareness.

Still, given the increased ability to quickly convert crypto and withdraw in fiat currencies, the uptick in funds leaving the ecosystem is astonishing. Part of this can be attributed to the growing fungibility of cryptocurrency, primarily helped by the support of players like Simplex, which empowers users to buy, sell, and spend crypto through Visa partnerships.

Although some of the latest rally’s onlookers have decried the rapid rise in crypto valuations as proof that a bubble is forming in this nascent asset class, others within the industry see the development as a harbinger of times to come. One of the areas this is most apparent is altcoins.

Data compiled by Simplex illustrates that as Bitcoin prices have leveled off above $30,000, daily purchases of altcoins have risen by approximately 65%. More interestingly, the data highlights that newer users account for nearly 20% of this volume, marking a sharp increase in the number of novice retail investors expanding and diversifying their exposure within the ecosystem.

Poloniex, one of the top 20 global cryptocurrency exchanges, which has adopted Simplex’s platform, has experienced these results firsthand. Karen McHenry, Poloniex’s Director of Product, attributes this development to greater access within the ecosystem, especially with Simplex’s buy option, which promotes instant account funding alongside the heightened ability to cash out quickly.

She also doesn’t see the ability to more quickly convert from crypto to fiat as harming interest despite the eyepopping amounts taken off exchanges.

It may sound surprising, but adding the ‘sell’ option actually has a positive impact on the number of crypto transactions too.

Though this easy offramp and soaring volume of sell orders might seem negative for prices, it can also be viewed as a healthy reflection of the ecosystem’s growing use cases. Besides making it easier to exit and enter, growing areas like decentralized finance (defi) and greater fungibility all contribute to a cryptocurrency’s value proposition.

As institutions begin lining up to add exposure as retail accumulation climbs, Bitcoin momentum may actually accelerate, and by extension, lift the altcoins sought after by the newcomers seeking opportunities outside the seminal crypto coin.

McHenry adds:

If the bull market can maintain its momentum, some of these BTC profits will flow into altcoins, which are particularly popular among retail investors. This creates a positive feedback loop, with traders who turn a profit prone to telling their friends about crypto, which brings more investment into the space.

The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) has posted a job advertisement that seeks to hire a role related to stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDC). The Fed is looking for a research manager to join its team to assess the “benefits and risks” of digital assets.

The Role Is Part of the Fed’s Digital Innovation Policy

Per the Linkedin job posting, the Federal Reserve Board expects the selected candidate to manage the “Digital Innovation Policy Program.” The department oversees “all aspects of a program focused on emerging issues at the intersection of technology and payments.”

The Fed highlights in the post, the “changing nature” of payment platforms in a digital environment. However, the role is not limited to doing in-depth research on how digital assets could benefit the economy.

In fact, the U.S. Federal Reserve is aiming with the research manager of the Digital Innovation Policy Program to address “regulatory framework for emerging payments platforms” issues.

The job advertisement also adds:

These topics require the Program to take into account diverse views across the Board and the Reserve Banks, necessitating a significant investment of time and resources in collaboration and communication across relevant bodies as well as the ability to cooperate with a range of domestic and international partners on digital innovations topics.

As of press time, there are 28 applicants interested via the Linkedin job posting.

Latest Developments on Stablecoins and CBDCs in the United States

The Fed has been recently treading waters on CBDCs through Jerome Powell’s speeches, the Federal Reserve chairman. During an online event at Princeton University in New Jersey earlier in January, Powell expressed that the American central bank is in no rush to be the first to work in a CBDC.

Moreover, the Fed’s chairman stressed that it could “take years” before the U.S. Federal Reserve releases a central bank digital currency.

In December 2020, three U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill that will force private stablecoin issuers to obtain a banking charter (or license) and get approval from the Fed before they can issue a stablecoin.

This past week, another social media trend started on the Reddit forum r/wallstreetbets, which aims to initiate a large silver short squeeze in order to push the price of the precious metal to $1,000 per ounce. However, the silver squeeze trend comes with controversy, as numerous wallstreetbets supporters believe hedge funds like Melvin Capital and Citadel are behind the silver push.

The Controversial ‘Silver Squeeze’

During the last week, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the wallstreetbets (WSB) saga taking place on social media forums and the infamous subreddit r/wallstreetbets. Since the mega short squeeze on the Gamestop (GME) shares, the squeeze maneuver has also spilled into a number of other stocks. This week, shares from the Russell 3000 Index (RUA) were targeted including tickers like NOK, GOGO, AMCX, and FIZZ. But the trend didn’t stop there, as one post, in particular, had called for a “silver squeeze.” The WSB Reddit post called for the silver squeeze to push the price of silver from $25 per ounce to $1,000.

Now since the post was published, the Reddit admins in charge of moderating r/wallstreetbets removed the post. But that was long after the message was made viral by the participants discussing the pros and cons of attempting to squeeze silver. Now the reason people think the silver short squeeze post may be shady, is because a number of WSB Redditors believe the silver squeeze was invoked by the hedge funds losing money in order to cover their GME losses. There are a great number of Reddit posts warning that people should not participate in the silver short squeeze.

One post said:

Citadel is the 5th largest owner of [silver], it’s imperative we do not ‘squeeze’ it. These are hedge fund bots spamming awards.

The people who dislike the silver trend on WSB, have also warned that Melvin Capital Management is also a big silver holder. Unfortunately, it is hard to tell where the silver pump threads and posts are stemming from, as there are many free-market supporters who are fans of the precious metal sometimes referred to as the ‘poor man’s gold.’

Despite this, there are numbers of WSB fans and Redditors claiming the silver pump stemmed from hedge fund people and they believe there are imposters everywhere now. Some of these people are growing irrational, getting mad at anyone who posts about silver. Many WSB supporters might be feeling the pain from Gamestop Corp. shares dropping significantly on Monday.

Silver soars past $30 a troy ounce as Reddit-fuelled buying frenzy continues for 3rd day. #Silversqueeze pic.twitter.com/mLmasUBrq1 — Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) February 1, 2021

In Spite of Controversy, Something Is Sparking Silver Demand

Despite the speculation, some sort of demand was invoked when it comes to silver prices and obtaining physical bullion. For instance, if you are attempting to purchase an ounce or ounces of silver bullion online, the process is far more complicated now than it was last week. A large portion of bars and coins are either sold out or the prices are marked up considerably.

This is simple arbitrage. #Silver futures are 28.67. Silver Eagles on Apmex are $41.66, thats a 45% premium to futures. Obvious opportunity to buy futures & stand for delivery for a 35% discount on physical right? But when they don't have it, Futures = $41.66/oz. #silversqueeze — Jonathan #SILVERSQUEEZE Mergott (@Jmergz1985) February 1, 2021

All the American Eagles are sold out across a number of bullion dealers. On Sunday morning, a few big-name dealers have halted a great number of silver sales. News.Bitcoin.com’s most recent WSB report disclosed how SD Bullion sold nearly 10x the number of silver ounces than usual. People visiting bullion dealer websites like Provident, Apmex, and JD Bullion could see the unprecedented demand targeting physical silver.

“In the last week, we have seen a dramatic shift in Silver demand from our customers,” said Ken Lewis CEO of the bullion dealer Apmex. “For example, the ratio of ounces sold per day was running about two times earlier in the week and closer to four times the average demand by the end of the week,” Lewis added.

The Apmex CEO further stressed:

Once markets closed on Friday, we saw demand hit as much as six times a typical business day and more than 12 times a normal weekend day. Combined with the extremely high demand levels, we are also seeing a surge in new customers. On Saturday alone, we added as many new customers as we usually add in a week.

Additionally, the hashtag “#silversqueeze” has been trending throughout the United States and a few other countries on Twitter during the last 48 hours. By the late afternoon on Sunday, spot silver and futures traded at $27 per Troy ounce, and by Monday morning spot silver traded 7.7% higher at $29.76. The commodity hopped above the $30 region, and silver prices per ounce exchanged hands at $30.35 an ounce. One ounce of .999 silver is hovering in the $29 price handle at the time of publication

As dogecoin’s frenzy keeps making the headlines in the crypto sphere, some people are not happy with it. Billy Markus, Dogecoin’s cofounder, has been a target of long-lasting online harassment, which still doesn’t end, he claims.

Markus Sold All His Doge in 2015

The so-called meme coin, DOGE skyrocketed well over 325% in a single day, specifically on January 29, 2021. The dynamic was the similar one followed by the Gamestop/Wallstreetbets saga. In this case, a Reddit group called Satoshistreetbets was allegedly behind the recent dogecoin’s pump.

However, Markus, also known in the crypto industry as “Shibetoshi Nakamoto,” published some tweets, clarifying publicly that he sold all his DOGE in 2015 after “getting laid off and freaking out about money.” In fact, he pointed out that money was enough to buy a used Honda Civic car.

Dogecoin’s cofounder also claimed that he left the Dogecoin project seven years ago due to harassment from the community. However, Dogecoin’s cofounder says he’s now “being harassed again.”

Although “Shibetoshi Nakamoto” didn’t provide additional details on who was behind the harassments against him, nor the nature surrounding it, he said:

Also, I don’t say this as a sob story – I’m financially fine – I just want to offer some perspective of what it feels like to have a mob demand you to do something for them on a project that you have no current involvement in, that you’ve seen others make many millions off of.

There are no reports on how much Markus’s net worth is nowadays.

Dogecoin Madness Remains Alive as the Month Kicks Off

At the start of February, dogecoin hit highs at $0.045, but its hovering around that neighborhood lasted briefly. According to markets.Bitcoin.com data, DOGE is exchanging hands at $0.0398, up 40.30% on Monday, with a market capitalization of $5.11B.

Twitter is featuring the hashtag #Dogecoinarmy as a trending topic in several countries like the United States and the United Kingdom. Also, there are still active efforts from dogecoins’ investors within the Reddit community to pump prices as the frenzy keeps alive.

In fact, as news.Bitcoin.com reported last week, one particular Reddit thread talks about holding dogecoin to get the price per unit to $10.

BitGesell represents a deflationary cryptocurrency that closely resembles bitcoin, but comes along with a few design changes. Its value proposition stems from Silvio Gesell’s financial market philosophy, who imagined monetary units that lose their value over time through demurrage. To keep things simple, BitGesell achieves scarcity through the means of accelerated block reward halvings and transaction fee burns.

The Dawn of the Crypto Age & Replacing Outdated Fiat

Over the last few years, the worldwide financial system has continuously lost its legitimacy, thereby positioning itself on the path to collapse. The key reason behind this downfall consists of monetary devaluation fueled by soaring levels of public debt. Instead of employing viable strategies for debt management, some governments prefer to keep themselves solvable via shameless money printing. In doing so, inflation rises so fiat money loses its purchasing power.

Luckily, this is the onset of a new era – the cryptocurrency age. Digital currencies follow strict rules that are hard-coded into their design, so no policy changes can shift their operational parameters. For instance, nobody can hope to change bitcoin’s 21 million minting limit. Doing so would entail a positive vote from the decentralized and independent community of miners, an improbable outcome.

At this time, blockchain-based digital currencies follow a common set of design principles. These include decentralization, transparency, immutability, security, privacy, versatility, low costs, and high transaction speed. Today’s cryptocurrencies are able to fulfil plenty of purposes, but the market still needs a coin that’s centered on becoming a veritable store of value for worldwide wealth. Such is the case with BitGesell, a newly-launched digital currency featuring a deflationary philosophy designed to increase its value over the long-term.

An Introduction to BitGesell

BitGesell represents a deflationary cryptocurrency that closely resembles bitcoin, but comes along with a few design changes. Its value proposition stems from Silvio Gesell’s financial market philosophy, who imagined monetary units that lose their value over time through demurrage, whilst adopting a minting mechanism that encourages economic activity and value growth. Referred to as Freigeld, Silvio’s financial philosophy could be utilized to consistently manage inflation while inducing scarcity.

BitGesell is based on a similar mechanism, yet opts for a few key design changes. BitGesell could be pictured as gold with a limited supply and constant reductions in its existing volume. The idea is simple – gold is valuable, but with supply shortages, its value will grow relative to all other commodities. Thus, those who choose to store a part of their wealth via gold will find themselves in the presence of an ever-growing portfolio. Such is the case with BitGesell. As a digital currency, it features numerous use case scenarios as it can be easily traded whenever necessary. After all, selling and purchasing gold is not too easy due to its physical form. This is in no way an issue when dealing with a scarcity-focused digital currency like BitGesell.

To keep things simple, BitGesell achieves scarcity through the means of accelerated block reward halvings and transaction fee burns. These scarcity-inducing mechanisms will be thoroughly described in a subsequent section.

Why Bitcoin’s Scarcity Strategy Is Outdated

To fully understand BitGesell’s value proposition, a comparison to bitcoin’s scarcity strategy is warranted. Every four years or so, bitcoin undergoes a scheduled halving event. This entails that miner rewards for adding a new block to the chain are halved, thereby limiting the supply of new coins. This mechanism was coded into the original version of bitcoin, and has remained unchanged ever since. From a technical standpoint, the event occurs after the successful mining of 210,000 blocks. Bitcoin started off with a 50 BTC miner reward, which was essentially halved every four years – first to 25, then to 12.5, and recently to 6.25. This event will continue occurring until bitcoin reaches its supply limit of 21 million BTC, scheduled for 2150. Afterwards, miners will continue to be incentivized for their services via transaction fees only.

Historically, the halving event was directly correlated with significant price uptrends, leading to newly-established all-time highs. This makes economic sense. As long as bitcoin continues to be popular, a decreasing supply and an increasing demand will drive up the prices. This is the result of the well-known economic laws of supply and demand.

So far, reports indicate that over 18 million bitcoin are already in circulation, with around 2.5 million left to be minted. However, many of the existing coins have been lost as a result of forgotten passwords, broken hard drives, and unwitty trading decisions. These coins continue to exist, but are unable to provide any value.

It has become clear that bitcoin’s scarcity mechanisms lead to value growth. As such, it is easy to imagine that additional scarcity actions may propel prices even further. Such code changes are unlikely to take place since bitcoin’s development team is well-known for being conservative. After all, you cannot ignore the heated block size debate aiming to decide whether bitcoin’s block size should be increased to sustain a higher transaction volume. No actual consensus has been reached amongst the network of miners, which is why bitcoin remains relatively unscalable, especially when utilized as a means of payment. Bitcoin’s use case as value storage remains questionable, as increased volatility during the bear market is prone to wipe out billions of dollars in value within a matter of hours.

Together, these challenges lead to questions and uncertainty. Given the goal of creating a crypto-based value storage, would another digital currency be better suited than bitcoin?

Highlighting BitGesell’s Key Features

BitGesell’s design solves many of the challenges highlighted above. As part of this section, readers will come to understand how BitGesell achieves optimal value storage through its deflationary mechanism.

BitGesell (BGL) is a hard fork from Bitcoin Core, employing a series of design challenges that differentiate it from its older brother. First off, BGL also relies on halving, but the development team has chosen to accelerate the process. Rather than occurring every four years, BitGesell undergoes a halving event once per year. The software architecture makes it impossible for this mechanism to ever change, so it’ll take significantly shorter for the total supply of BGL to be minted. Other than reducing block rewards, BitGesell also features a coin burning mechanism. This entails that 90% of transaction fees are burned, similarly to Silvio Gesell’s Freigeld principles. By withdrawing money from circulation, BGL’s price is incentivized to grow as long as there’s a demand for the coins.

As expected, BitGesell has opted to include the same minting limit as bitcoin. With a hard-capped limit of 21 million BGL, the consistent halvings and transactions burns will yield considerable value increases for coin owners, thereby transforming BitGesell into an optimal means of value storage. Miners have no need to worry; despite the shrinking supply and transaction fee burns, those who choose to hold onto their crypto will harvest a considerable payoff as the coin’s value grows at an accelerated rate.

Regarding its technical specifications, BGL has a block weight of 400KB – ten times lower when compared to bitcoin’s. This helps BitGesell’s blockchain achieve significant performance by being able to sustain a sufficient transaction throughput, even if mass-adopted. With a lower block time, transactions are bound to confirm within a few minutes, largely unaffected by potential network congestion.

BitGesell does not sacrifice any of the benefits associated with bitcoin. Its blockchain retains all advantages, including decentralization, immutability, transparency, low costs, and optimal security. In fact, BGL even retains SegWit compatibility.

Resources and Project Roadmap

It is imperative to keep in mind that BitGesell is a community-driven open-source project. All relevant decisions are taken by the community, which collaborates on aspects like code development, user base building, branding, and marketing.

Developers, investors, and futurists that believe in BitGesell’s ascension as a value storage cryptocurrency can easily get involved. BGL’s value remains relatively stable, as it’s only been made available since April 2020, when the genesis block was mined. Developers are welcome to get involved with BGL Core, the open-source software designed to govern the cryptocurrency’s operations. On the other hand, users might want to consider purchasing BGL via Hotbit, Crex24, AlterDice and Catex. The block explorer is live and ready to use, and so are the mining pools for those looking to sustain BitGesell’s operations. The BGL wallet software is the go-to method for storing BGL.

The BitGesell community is currently working on increasing branding and marketing efforts, while building the BGL-API server destined for service building.

Based on these aspects, BitGesell comes forth with the use case of efficiently storing value over the long-term. By employing Silvio Gesell’s financial philosophy and retaining its similarity to bitcoin, BitGesell’s value is destined for growth thanks to its deflationary strategy, fueled by accelerated halvings and transaction fee burns.

#2. User Data and PRQ

Every single monitoring target (primitive of type address, a struct with the field of address type, table row) would require 1 PRQ to hold after the implementation. It means that if there are 1000 addresses (960 in the table as rows, 30 as primitives, 10 in the structs) then the User would need 1000 PRQ on the connected Ethereum Account balance.

#3. IQ Protocol

IQ Protocol will allow risk-free PRQ lending and collateral-less borrowing. Risk-free PRQ lending means that PRQ is not transferred from the lender’s address to the borrower’s address. Details on the algorithm are available in the dedicated explainer on PARSIQ’s blog.

#4. PRQBoost

PRQ Boost is a liquidity boost program to incentivize PRQ/ETH liquidity providers on Uniswap, which goes with the PRQBOOST utility tokens to increase rewards for liquidity providers.

PRESS RELEASE. YFX, the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts has just launched, adding an important piece to the DeFi money legos, and creating a direct competition against CEX on derivatives trading.

The most traded Bitcoin product in centralized exchanges is Bitcoin futures, which is 10 times bigger than spot trading in terms of the trading volume. But in DEX, spot trading platforms like Uniswap are occupying a large portion of the total trading volume, and there is not a single decentralized futures trading platform that could reach even 1/10 of Uniswap’s trading volume. What stops decentralized futures trading platforms from becoming 10 times bigger than Uniswap? Why are decentralized futures trading platforms performing worse than their centralized counterparts?

The main reason is that decentralized futures exchanges don’t currently provide an attractive futures product to compete with centralized futures exchanges. For instance, centralized futures exchanges like BitMex can provide 100x leverage on Bitcoin futures trading. On the other hand, decentralized futures exchanges like dYdX only offer 10x leverage. None of the decentralized exchanges can keep up with the 100x leverage offering from centralized exchanges.

YFX Descartes V1 uses QIC-AMM and a system de-risk mechanism to migrate perpetual futures trading from CEX to DEX without reducing the trading leverage, which makes YFX the first DEX that could offer 100x leverage on a perpetual contract. You can do everything on YFX that you can do on BitMex or OKEx. YFX is poised to compete directly against established centralized exchanges. YFX Descartes V1 runs on the TRON MainNet, for faster transaction times and cheaper gas fees compared to Ethereum. The YFX team is also working on Ethereum’s Layer 2 solution to provide pragmatic perpetual trading on DEX. YFX team plans to launch their DEX on Huobi Heco and Ethereum Test net in Q1, 2021.

About YFX

YFX is the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts. YFX Descartes V1 launched on the TRON MainNet, and all trades are held and processed by smart contracts. The main goal of the YFX team, which is formed by a group of engineers who have years of experience working on trading systems and blockchain, is to build a DEX that can compete with CEX on derivative trading.

In a surge reminiscent of dogecoin’s recent rally, the value of the XRP token soared by more than 100% in just 48 hours. After starting the day at $0.29 on January 30, data shows that the token peaking at just above $0.67. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.66

As shown on markets.Bitcoin.com, after this price surge, the market capitalization of XRP went up to almost $28 billion, a figure close to double that of Polkadot. This means XRP has now reclaimed its position for now as the fourth highest-ranked crypto. Similarly, data from messari.io shows that XRP peaked at $0.68 on February 1.

With the token issuer Ripple Labs facing legal challenges, XRP’s unexpected price surge might lend credence to reports that an offshoot of the Wallstreetbets (WSB) is helping to pump the crypto.

Already, this movement of retail traders known as Satoshistreetbets has received partial credit for dogecoin’s recent meteoric rise. Buoyed by Wallstreetbets’ Gamestop short squeeze, Satoshistreetbets Redditors successfully campaigned for dogecoin and this caused its value to skyrocket.

At the time of writing, some crypto enthusiasts on social media are calling on retail crypto investors to join a campaign to pump XRP.

CHAPTER ONE: Listening to the Past

“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.” — Satoshi Nakamoto

The trusted third party problem has haunted modern financial systems and centralized exchanges because people require an intermediary to make them work. The third party’s good or bad motives become a defining aspect of the transaction, and the those who use the institutions are at the mercy of those intentions. This is especially true of the current system of state-issued money and central banking.

A trustless system avoids intermediaries and does not depend upon the intentions of participants; that is, the system functions in the same manner regardless of anyone’s intentions. The blockchain, with a transparent and immutable peer-to peer protocol, is called trustless because there is no corruptible intermediary upon whom exchanges must depend.

On a small scale, the trusted third party problem may always exist because a middleman is useful or necessary in some situations. If third parties offer competitive services on a free market, however, the damage of dishonesty or incompetence is limited. People can take their business elsewhere, report a swindler to watchdogs, warn others, and file a lawsuit.

An occasionally dishonest third party is not the problem Satoshi addresses. He speaks to the institutionalized corruption of government and central banks from which the average person could not escape by using a competitor or by suing. Almost everyone who works over the table, runs a business, buys or sells goods, accepts government benefits or pays taxes has had to accept a fiat that constantly plunges in value due to inflation. Almost everyone who uses credit, accepts checks, takes out loans, conducts commerce or does business abroad has needed to go through banks that steal like drunken muggers.

For average people, the situation used to seem hopeless because no legal, practical, and private alternative existed for transferring funds across considerable distance, including borders. Attempts to reform or remove the system also seemed doomed because it was inherently corrupt and self-serving. In fact, fiat and central banking were serving the purpose for which they had been established: financial control by elites. People’s need for money and exchange became their straitjackets.

Then Satoshi. Then the blockchain and crypto. A new concept of money was created in a form that cannot not be inflated; the number of bitcoins is fixed at 21 million divisible units. The supply can only decrease when coins are lost, as inevitably happens. Satoshi notes, “Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.” Bitcoin solved the fiat problem.

A new concept of financial transfer solved the third party problem, especially with regard to banks. Although peer-to-peer transactions involve a middleman or miner, no trust is required since the transaction is released only when “proof of work” is rendered, which consists of solving a complicated math problem. Arriving at a solution may be costly in computer power and time, but the solutions themselves are easy to verify. Satoshi comments, “With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.” The soundness and propriety of the blockchain’s protocol itself is assured by the use of open source that is visible to all and verifiable. The political outcome: A private currency and method of exchange freed people from financial oppression.

The idea of private currency itself is hardly new, however.

Precedent in Radical Individualist Theory

The late Friedrich Hayek is the most respected Austrian economist of the 20th century. His book The Denationalisation of Money: An Analysis of the Theory and Practice of Concurrent Currencies argues vigorously for private and competitive currencies to displace government-issued ones. Hayek ponders a key question. “When one studies the history of money one cannot help wondering why people should have put up for so long with governments exercising an exclusive power over two thousand years that was regularly used to exploit and defraud them. This can be explained only by the myth” that government money was necessary “becoming so firmly established that it did not occur even to the professional students of these matters…ever to question it. But once the validity of the established doctrine is doubted its foundation is rapidly seen to be fragile.”

Governments reap incredible profits from debasing the currency, but the rigged game works only if people have no alternative but to play it. The political purpose of legal tender and banking laws is to grant a monopoly to the state, which permits the redistribution of wealth and power from average people upward to the elite of society. Fiat money and banking remains fragile, however, because the system relies on people either not understanding the dynamics or not having a choice. Hayek wonders why public understanding is so elusive. Why was “a government monopoly of the provision of money…universally regarded as indispensable” and what would happen “if the provision of money were thrown open to the competition of private concerns supplying different currencies?”

With eerie prescience, Hayek argues for currencies developed by entrepreneurs who innovate new forms of money just as they innovate in other areas. One of the drawbacks of government’s monopoly is that it imposes a freeze on the sort of invention that now runs free in crypto. The voluntaryist historian Carl Watner observes, “No one can tell in advance what form these monies might take because no one can know for sure what choices individuals would make or what new technologies might be discovered. Laws forcing people to use the Federal Reserve System money have frozen monetary developments at a certain stage…Just imagine if Congress had protected the Post Office by passing laws that would have prevented people from communicating via the internet. We would never have experienced the marvels of e-mail.”

The late Austrian economist Murray Rothbard also wrestles with the question of “why do people so vigorously resist private currencies?” His book For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto advances an explanation. “If the government and only the government had had a monopoly of the shoe manufacturing and retailing business, how would most of the public treat the libertarian who now came along to advocate that the government get out of the shoe business and throw it open to private enterprise?” Rothbard predicts that the skeptics would attack the libertarian for depriving them of the only possible source of shoes—the government. People are thoroughly indoctrinated to believe that daily life cannot function without the state and fiat.

Hayek and Rothbard are unusual among free-market economists in their embrace of private money and monetary systems. Even laissez-faire zealots rarely champion free-market currencies or private banking. Instead, they debate marginal issues such as fractional reserve and other reforms they think will improve the existing system. Or they argue for the restoration of a gold standard as though it were a panacea. But if a gold standard were applied to fiat, the system would still require people to trust the government and banks. This means trusting both institutions to act against their own interests, which they have historically neglected to do.

The modern neglect of free-market money and banking is odd because 19th century radical individualists focused intensely on the importance of private money and private banking to personal freedom. They placed a primal emphasis on the right of every individual to create his own currency and to function as his own bank. It was a natural right as important as freedom of speech or of religion. The pivotal individualist Benjamin Tucker believed that the right to issue private currency was so important that it could destroy the State all by itself. His reasoning: The money monopoly, including control of credit, was how the State sustained itself and robbed average people not merely of wealth but also of economic opportunity.

Two specific events sculpted the approach that the early individualist-anarchists adopted toward the monetary monopoly. One was the Panic of 1837 that tipped the United States into recession until the mid-1840s. Commonly cited causes of the Panic include a collapsing land bubble and a sharp fall in cotton prices. Blame is also placed at the feet of President Andrew Jackson for vetoing the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States and precipitating an unfortunate chain of economic events. Drawing on the work of Professor of Economics Peter Temin, Rothbard disputes this interpretation.

First, he [Temin] points out that the price inflation really began earlier, when wholesale prices reached a trough of 82 in July 1830 and then rose by 20.7 percent in three years to reach 99 in the fall of 1833. The reason for the price rise is simple: The total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $159 million in 1833, an increase of 45.9 percent, or an annual rise of 15.3 percent. Breaking the figures down further, the total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $155 million a year and a half later, a spectacular expansion of 35 percent. Unquestionably, this monetary expansion was spurred by the still-flourishing Bank of the United States, which increased its notes and deposits from January 1830 to January 1832 from a total of $29 million to $42.1 million, a rise of 45.2 percent. Thus, the price and money inflation in the first few years of the 1830s were again sparked by the expansion of the still-dominant central bank.

Arguably, the Panic began in May 1837 when banks in New York City announced they would not redeem commercial paper for specie at full face value. Of the approximately 800 banks in America, all but six ceased at one point or another to redeem banknotes and deposits for gold or silver coins. Suspicion and hatred of traditional banks and government-issued money soared, with radicals scrutinizing alternate systems.

The other event dramatically to impact the radical fever from monetary reform was the Civil War for which the North financed its fighting through Legal Tender Acts and the National Banking Act of 1863.

The radicals did not merely theorize; they experimented with private currencies and new economic models. Their efforts are fascinating, but they are also cautionary tales. A major problem for 19th-century individualist-anarchism was the movement’s general acceptance of a link between sound money and the labor theory of value. This theory states that the true value of a good or service is based on the labor required to produce it rather than the price at which a seller and buyer are willing to exchange. In short, a good has intrinsic and not subjective value. (More on this in the section on the Regression Theorem.) Happily, their main economic goal was the abolition of the “money monopoly.” The term referred to three different but interacting forms of monopoly: banking, the charging of interest, and the privileged issuance of currency. The abolition of state power over currency was the focus, and they eschewed the use of force to implement their own schemes.

Josiah Warren provided a real-world example of what was meant by a currency that rested on the labor theory of value. Credited with being the first American anarchist, Warren tested his specific solution to the money monopoly through a Time Store from which he issued “Labor Notes.” In 1827, the business opened with $300 worth of groceries and dry goods that were offered at a 7 percent markup from Warren’s own costs in order to cover expenses such as overhead. This was before groceries were prepackaged or preweighed, and it was usual for buyers to bargain with the shopkeeper rather than pay a posted price. One of

Warren’s innovations was to post prices, which drove costs lower because transactions consumed less time. The customer paid in traditional money for the goods and paid with a Labor Note to compensate Warren for his time. The Labor Note obliged the customer to provide Warren with an equivalent amount of his time. If the buyer was a seamstress, for example, the Labor Note committed her to render to Warren X units of time to produce clothing. Warren’s goal was to establish an economy—or to establish a proof of principle, at least—in which profit was based on the exchange of time and labor. The Labor Notes were circulated and traded widely with in the community.

To some degree, Warren succeeded. People traveled from a hundred miles away to avail themselves of the Time Store’s low prices. After a few years, he declared the experiment to be a success and closed the store. Whether the Labor Notes were a success is questionable, however. The store itself may well have succeeded due to its low prices, not to the Notes. Whichever explanation is true, it is difficult to see how this novel currency could function in dense populations or on a grander scale of commerce. Few people today would be convinced of the viability of private money based on the Time Store experiment.

What could convince the public and economists that private currencies work as well or better than government-issued ones? Going back a bit further in American history is a good place to start because the future is always based on the past.

Global music distribution service Ditto has unveiled the latest addition to its service lineup for musicians with a blockchain-based financing platform named Opulous.

Opulous Peer-to-Peer Lending Platform Serves as a Loan Pool Designed to Help Artists

Ditto continues its efforts to improve the value chain for artists. Unlike other decentralized finance (defi) protocols, Opulous reflects asset-based lending, which bridges the physical and digital worlds. The Opulous’ defi lending mechanism, which is being developed on the Algorand public blockchain, leverages music copyrights’ tangibility through a smart contract setup that automatically handles principal and interest payments along with distributions to investors.

For musicians already receiving royalties, this presents a unique opportunity to monetize their assets or contribute to the pool to stake other artists. When seeking capital, artists can access funds by collateralizing loans from Opulous’ Music Copyright Pools with their music royalties.

Besides digitizing music as an asset class, the move will invite more democratized participation from artists and investors seeking to gain a foothold in the music industry, which is undergoing tremendous annual growth and expected to double in size by 2030. Artists benefit from interest rates starting as low as 4%, while investors in the copyright pools can add exposure to music royalties as an asset class for 10% returns per annum.

Per Ditto CEO Lee Parsons,

Opulous cuts out traditional banking, providing musicians with a platform with minimal interest payments, while giving investors the chance to stake a claim in one of the most exciting and fastest-growing financial industries in the world.

Ditto, which has already processed more than $1 billion in royalties for its 250,000-plus users, sees industry revenues doubling in the next ten years, building a compelling investment thesis. In keeping with Opulous’ mission to democratize musicians’ financial access, users outside the Ditto ecosystem are welcome to join the peer-to-peer lending framework.

Opulous has raised $1.5 million in funding to-date from BASIC, Borderless Capital, Kosmos Capital, Somesing, and TrustVerse. Roll out of the platform’s minimum viable product (MVP) is anticipated in two months as development proceeds.

Elastos, which built its decentralized application (dapp) platform and currency (ELA) to protect users’ digital assets and creations, will be among the first token staking partners for Opulous’ proof-of-stake consensus protocol. Opulous, in concert with Elastos, will allow investors to stake their Elastos (ELA) coins within the Music Copyright Pools.

According to Clarence Liu, the VP of Development at the Elastos Foundation,

Elastos and Ditto Music have been researching how blockchain can address fundamental inefficiencies in the music industry. Access to funding – which Opulous will address – is only the tip of the iceberg.

“Our collaboration has much more in the pipeline and our community is definitely set on using the forward momentum sparked by recent world events to introduce new users to the decentralized internet ideals set by Elastos,” Liu concludes.

During the last year, Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem has grown exponentially to form a multi Billion Dollar market. As Decentralized Finance expands, it becomes more and more relevant to have cross-chain connections that enable crypto assets to flow instantly and seamlessly across blockchain networks. These make it possible for DeFi platforms to be an effective alternative to centralized exchanges. Today, pNetwork launches the first EOS to Ethereum cross-chain connection to enable the EOS crypto asset to be moved into Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem.

EOS on Ethereum

EOS, the native token on the EOS blockchain, is a top20 cryptocurrency by market cap and the engine powering one of the most active dApps ecosystems. The asset counts over $ 3.5 Billion in daily trading volumes, figuring as the 9th most traded cryptocurrency. At present, only a fraction of the total is happening in a decentralized fashion.

While the DeFi ecosystem on EOS continues to grow, it has not yet reached Ethereum’s size. The latter powers Billions in daily trading volumes, Uniswap being the largestlarges liquidity protocol in existence and the fourth biggest DeFi protocol in terms of Total Value Locked.

Following the delivery of 26 bridges connecting six different blockchain protocols, including the cross-chain transfer of popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin, pNetwork launches today a new cross-chain connection that brings EOS to Ethereum.

As the first tokenised version of EOS, pEOS makes the asset compatible with Ethereum’s DeFi. This creates a benefit on both sides, enabling Ethereum’s DeFi protocols to expand their range of assets supported and granting EOS the option to be traded in a decentralized fashion as well as being supported as a collateral type by major Ethereum-based landing platforms.

Cross-chain connections are critical for a variety of use-cases, from NFTs to market making to decentralized indexes such as PieDAO’s Pies. pNetwork-powered asset tokenisation on Ethereum enables such indexes to represent the entire crypto market.

All pTokenised assets are pegged 1:1 to their underlying asset and are available for automated minting or redeeming on the pTokens dApp. In addition, pTokens are supported on a variety of DeFi protocols, decentralized exchanges and wallets on a growing number of blockchains.

Making Ethereum and EOS dApps Interoperable

Ethereum and EOS are two of the most active ecosystems for dApps, counting thousands of users each. By connecting these two blockchain environments, pNetwork aims to support the growth and development of decentralized applications such as lending/borrowing, trading, derivatives, and more. Acting as a cross-chain highway for cryptocurrencies to frictionlessly move from one blockchain to another, pNetwork powers the first bi-directional connection between the Ethereum and EOS blockchains.

Users on either blockchain are now able to interact with both ecosystems without ever leaving their blockchain of choice. Projects from both Ethereum and EOS communities have developed building blocks to create the next-generation financial system – with the connection between these two, users will find an even more powerful DeFi ecosystem.

By leveraging pNetwork’s cross-chain solution, dApps on the two blockchain platforms now have the opportunity to interoperate. Each ecosystem leveraging its counterpart’s strengths ultimately creates a benefit on both sides and sets the basis for sustainable growth. The presence of an EOS/ETH decentralized trading pair both with Ethereum’s and EOS’s decentralized finance, for example, makes it possible for market makers to arbitrage between the two blockchains. This results in a more liquid decentralized market for both assets.

Ukraine’s government-owned nuclear power plant picked a firm to build a massive data center in Rivne for cryptocurrency mining operations. After a bidding process, Energoatom chose Kyiv Energy Construction Company to handle the nuclear plant crypto mining project.

Nuclear Power Plant Operator Expects to Launch the Data Center in 2022

According to official documents, the data center will be based in the Rivne nuclear power plant, after the construction firm got 8.92 million Hryvnia ($317,620) in funding. The only competitor in the bidding was Ukrenergobudproek. However, they allegedly made an expensive offer, said the regional news outlet Forklog.

The Kyiv Energy Construction Company expects to finish the data center building by August 31, 2022. Per the announcement, the contractor is required to send the documentation that details the whole process. It includes “host state registers, electronic archives, and computing facilities.”

In terms of technical details, the nuclear power plant has a capacity of 2,657 megawatts, and it was built in the late 1970s. Also, the operations of the state-owned nuclear facilities started at the beginning of 1980.

In October 2020, Energoatom also signed a memorandum with a subsidiary of crypto mining giant Bitfury. With the new data center, local media outlets believe Bitfury miners could move their operations into the power plant’s facilities.

Ukraine’s Interest Towards Building Crypto Mining Data Centers in Nuclear Plants

The deal between Energoatom and Kyiv Energy Construction Company is not a surprising move. In fact, the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine asked Energoatom in May 2020 to conduct research to assess crypto mining’s feasibility at their nuclear plants.

As an anecdotal fact in terms of crypto mining in Ukrainian nuclear plants, the nation’s Security Service found illegal crypto mining equipment in a nuclear power plant in 2019.

The installation’s illegal mining rigs were found in the Southern region of Ukraine. Moreover, the investigations determined that such illegal equipment breached a “state secret.”

As the so-called ‘meme coin’ is actively making the headlines within the crypto sphere, a publicly-traded company is joining the dogecoin frenzy. Kronos Advanced Technology announced they’ll start accepting dogecoin as one of its payment methods.

Kronos Also Accepts Other Cryptocurrencies Such as Bitcoin and Ether

According to the announcement, the Los Angeles-based firm is adding dogecoin (DOGE) to its accepted payment form. In fact, customers will be able to purchase air purifiers, and personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies via the meme coin.

Adopting dogecoin as a payment method was not as part as just of a crypto adoption-driven maneuver. The company praised the popularity of the token and its uniqueness within the industry.

Also, Kronos pointed out that dogecoins transactions’ speed is a positive note for the Shiba Inu inspired meme token. So far, the company accepts several cryptos as payment methods, such as bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), litecoin (LTC), among others.

Expanding N95 Mask Market Into the Dogecoin Community

Michael Rubinov, president of Kronos Advanced Technologies, commented on the company’s stance towards cryptocurrencies:

In the last ten years, much has been said about how cryptocurrency will revolutionize payments, services, businesses and will change the world the way we know it. Cryptocurrency has changed e-commerce: as more and more people now shop online. Cryptocurrency gives customers more reasons to utilize the convenience of online shopping, as it mitigates the risk of fraud for both vendors and shoppers.

By adopting dogecoin as a form of payment, Kronos also expect to market N95 masks to the entire meme coin community on Reddit, which has grown over 670,000 members. The company also praised the fact that Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk endorses dogecoin as one of his favorite cryptocurrencies.

Despite the recent frenzy seen in the meme coin, the latest markets.Bitcoin.com data shows that dogecoin is exchanging hands at $0.0317, down -20.43% on Tuesday. The market capitalization still stands at $4.08 billion.

Spacex and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been trying to get to the bottom of what happened with the popular trading app Robinhood when it stopped people from buying shares of hot stocks, like Gamestop. The shares of these stocks became popular due to the Wallstreetbets movement.

Elon Musk Says People Want the Truth From Robinhood

During an interview on The Good Time Show via the Clubhouse app Sunday night, Elon Musk grilled the CEO of trading app Robinhood, Vlad Tenev, over the company’s decision to restrict hot stocks last week, including Gamestop. On Friday, Robinhood also restricted crypto trading, citing “extraordinary market conditions.”

“What happened last week? Why can’t people buy the Gamestop shares? The people demand an answer and they want to know the details and the truth,” Musk said.

Tenev began by explaining the structure of his company. “Robinhood is actually a couple of companies,” he described. Robinhood Financial processes trades, Robinhood Securities clears and settles the trades, and Robinhood Crypto which deals with crypto trades.

The Robinhood CEO detailed that last Wednesday, his platform experienced “unprecedented volume” as “a lot of these so-called meme stocks were going viral on social media and people were joining Robinhood” to buy these stocks. Consequently, the company “received a file” from the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) Thursday morning at about 3:30 AM PST. It requested Robinhood to “put up money to the NSCC based on some factors,” including the volatility of certain securities. Tenev clarified that “this is the equities business so it’s based on stock trading and not options trading or anything else,” elaborating:

They gave us a file with a deposit and the request was around $3 billion dollars which is about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is.

Musk interrupted Tenev, questioning: “Why is that so high? It sounds like this is an unprecedented increase in demand for capital. What formula did they use to calculate that?”

Tenev replied: “We don’t have the full details. It’s a little bit of an opaque formula but there’s a component called the VAR of it, which is the Value at Risk, and that’s based on kind of some fairly quantitative things … and then there’s a special component which is discretionary so that kind of acts as a multiplier.” Tenev also noted that up until that point, his company “has raised a little bit around two billion dollars in total venture capital,” so the request was “a big number.”

The Tesla CEO interrupted again, asking: “What everyone wants to know is did something maybe shady go down here? It seems weird that you’d get a sudden $10 billion demand in the morning … suddenly out of nowhere.” Tenev swiftly corrected Musk that the number was $3 billion. The Robinhood CEO then emphasized:

I wouldn’t impugn shadiness to it or anything like that, and actually the NSCC was reasonable subsequent to this. They worked with us to actually lower it. It was unprecedented activity.

Musk abruptly asked Tenev: “Is there anyone holding you hostage right now?” Tenev chuckled and replied: “No, no, I’m okay. Thanks for asking.” Both laughed.

The Robinhood CEO proceeded to explain what happened, calling the experience “nerve-wrecking.” He said after receiving the request for $3 billion, his chief operating officer called up someone higher up at the NSCC to discuss what to do. “There was another call and they lowered it to something like $1.4 billion from $3 billion,” Tenev reiterated that it was still a high number. His company then proposed a plan to the NSCC of “marking these volatile stocks that were kind of driving the activity position-closing only.”

Then, at about 5 to 5:30 AM PST, before the market opened, the NSCC came back and reduced the deposit requirement to $700 million, “which we then deposited and paid promptly,” Tenev emphasized. Acknowledging that the move was bad for customers, the Robinhood CEO said, “We had no choice, in this case. We had to conform to our regulatory capital requirements and so the team did what they could to make sure we were available for customers.”

The Spacex CEO further questioned: “Who controls this organization, this clearinghouse?” Tenev replied: “It’s a consortium. It’s not quite a government agency. I don’t really know the details of all of that.” Nonetheless, he emphasized that “To be fair … I think there was legitimate sort of turmoil in the markets … so there probably is some amount of extra risk in the system that warrants higher requirements so it’s not entirely unreasonable.” He noted that lots of other brokers were in the same situation and had to restrict the same activity.

“So it sounds like this organization calls you up and they basically have a gun to your head: either hand over this money or else,” the Spacex CEO summarized, elaborating:

Basically, what people are wondering is did you sell your clients down the river or did you have no choice. If you had no choice, that’s understandable but then we got to find out why you had no choice and who are these people that are saying you have no choice.

“I think that’s fair. We have to comply with these requirements. Financial institutions have requirements,” Tenev responded. Nonetheless, he suggested that it would be helpful to know the formula the NSCC uses to calculate these requirements so companies can plan better.

Musk proceeded to ask about whether there was outside pressure forcing Robinhood to take the action it did. Tenev affirmed that there is “a rumor that Citadel or other market makers kind of pressured us into doing this.” However, he clarified, “that’s just false,” emphasizing that “this was a clearinghouse decision and it was just based on the capital requirements so from our perspective Citadel and other market makers weren’t involved in that.”

During the same Clubhouse interview, Elon also revealed that he is a supporter of bitcoin and should have bought the cryptocurrency eight years ago. He believes that bitcoin is on the verge of getting broad acceptance by traditional finance people. On Monday, Robinhood raised another $2.4 billion from shareholders after it secured $1 billion last Thursday.

The Wall Street Bets saga, an incredibly ridiculous story about a group of amateur Reddit investors who beat career Wall Street hedge funds at their own game, is to be made into a movie.

According to a report by online news site Deadline on Jan. 31, Metro Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) won the rights to produce the film in a bidding war involving major Hollywood movie houses.

The movie is to be based on a book proposed by author Ben Mezrich. Mezrich’s previous work, “The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding Of Facebook, a Tale Of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal,” was adapted into the motion picture “The Social Network.”

The title to his planned latest book offering is called “The Antisocial Network,” said the report, quoting sources familiar with the development. The book is expected to go out to publishers later this February, it said.

However, it is not yet clear what shape or structure the movie will take. MGM’s Michael DeLuca will produce the film. DeLuca also produced the Academy-Award winning The Social Network. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss will executive produce via their Winklevoss Pictures production company.

The Wall Street Bets group noticed that major hedge funds on Wall Street had been placing short bets against companies they considered to be dying. The funds particularly targeted Gamestop, the world’s largest video game retailer, continually shorting the company’s shares.

But the Redditors saw an opportunity to make profit and collectively bet the other way, buying shares and stock options. This resulted in the value of the Gamestop shares soaring by more than 2,600% in January.

Hedge funds that had shorted the stock incurred losses running into several billions of dollars. One fund, Melvin Capital, reportedly lost up to $7 billion to the “short squeeze” in January, forcing it to restructure its investment portfolio to ensure a faster escape in future “squeezes.”

The Reddit traders also extended the pump to a few other stocks considered to be dying, including AMC (which climbed over 900% in January), as well as Nokia and Blackberry. This surge of activity resulted in a major controversy when the trading app Robinhood began restricting trade on certain stocks.

Alongside the cryptocurrency’s meteoric climb over the back half of 2020 and early 2021, a curious phenomenon has unfolded; heightened profit-taking and conversion to fiat currencies. Data collected by Simplex, a fiat-crypto gateway, underscores this seemingly paradoxical development.

A Curious Race to Convert Crypto to Fiat Has Accompanied Bitcoin’s Latest Drive Higher

Sharing exclusive data with Bitcoin.com, Simplex cofounder and chief analytics officer Netanel Kabala says:

While the international press coverage of Bitcoin’s rally has caused a swathe of new users to flock to the industry and buy-in, outflows have been equally significant. Of the total amount of cryptocurrency sold in the last six months, 43% was off ramped in December alone.

A quick look at Google Trends for the term ‘Bitcoin’ echoes these developments, especially now that new equity instruments like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and big-name funds like Blackrock are adding exposure and raising crypto awareness.

Still, given the increased ability to quickly convert crypto and withdraw in fiat currencies, the uptick in funds leaving the ecosystem is astonishing. Part of this can be attributed to the growing fungibility of cryptocurrency, primarily helped by the support of players like Simplex, which empowers users to buy, sell, and spend crypto through Visa partnerships.

Although some of the latest rally’s onlookers have decried the rapid rise in crypto valuations as proof that a bubble is forming in this nascent asset class, others within the industry see the development as a harbinger of times to come. One of the areas this is most apparent is altcoins.

Data compiled by Simplex illustrates that as Bitcoin prices have leveled off above $30,000, daily purchases of altcoins have risen by approximately 65%. More interestingly, the data highlights that newer users account for nearly 20% of this volume, marking a sharp increase in the number of novice retail investors expanding and diversifying their exposure within the ecosystem.

Poloniex, one of the top 20 global cryptocurrency exchanges, which has adopted Simplex’s platform, has experienced these results firsthand. Karen McHenry, Poloniex’s Director of Product, attributes this development to greater access within the ecosystem, especially with Simplex’s buy option, which promotes instant account funding alongside the heightened ability to cash out quickly.

She also doesn’t see the ability to more quickly convert from crypto to fiat as harming interest despite the eyepopping amounts taken off exchanges.

It may sound surprising, but adding the ‘sell’ option actually has a positive impact on the number of crypto transactions too.

Though this easy offramp and soaring volume of sell orders might seem negative for prices, it can also be viewed as a healthy reflection of the ecosystem’s growing use cases. Besides making it easier to exit and enter, growing areas like decentralized finance (defi) and greater fungibility all contribute to a cryptocurrency’s value proposition.

As institutions begin lining up to add exposure as retail accumulation climbs, Bitcoin momentum may actually accelerate, and by extension, lift the altcoins sought after by the newcomers seeking opportunities outside the seminal crypto coin.

McHenry adds:

If the bull market can maintain its momentum, some of these BTC profits will flow into altcoins, which are particularly popular among retail investors. This creates a positive feedback loop, with traders who turn a profit prone to telling their friends about crypto, which brings more investment into the space.

Do you think the offramping will continue throughout 2021? Let us know in the comments sections below.

PRESS RELEASE. CEX.IO LOAN experiences massive institutional demand for its crypto-backed lending service, with 41% of customers requesting to borrow cash against Bitcoin, 53% against Ethereum, and 6% against DeFi tokens.

Crypto-backed lending service CEX.IO LOAN that launched in October 2020 in select global jurisdictions, has been experiencing major demand, receiving over $100 million worth of loan requests to date. While the service has been widely popular among retail investors, most of the platform’s loan requests came from institutional investors.

According to CEX.IO LOAN, such an increase in demand can be attributed to the institutionalization of the cryptocurrency industry. Institutional investors, who have cryptocurrencies in their possession, regard it as a potential collateral for borrowing funds and actively utilise it as such. The borrowed funds are then used for further investment purposes.

In addition to featuring cutting-edge security and advanced anti-fraud measures, CEX.IO Group operates a regulated service, which has been licensed as a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) provider by the Gibraltar Financial Service Commission (GFSC) since last year. In addition to this, the Government of Gibraltar recently granted CEX.IO Limited a Money Lender License, allowing the firm to extend its ecosystem of regulated services with CEX.IO LOAN.

Institutional clients also prefer the company’s digital asset-backed lending service due to the convenience offered to users. On the CEX.IO LOAN platform, customers can borrow cash against their cryptocurrency assets in a quick and simple manner, without having to deal with credit checks or any unnecessary paperwork. To access the company’s instant crypto-backed lending service, new users have to open an account at the digital asset exchange and pass the mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML checks.

CEX.IO LOAN serves various cryptocurrency market participants, from retail investors, traders, and HODLers to startups, entrepreneurs, and large enterprises. As part of a flexible crypto-backed lending service, users can borrow any amount between $500 and $100,000 at competitive interest rates starting at 8.75% per year. Loan duration ranging from seven days to one year.

Currently, retail users can borrow funds against their Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) assets. Based on the company’s data, the feature has already experienced high demand from VIP clients, with 41% of all CEX.IO LOAN customers borrowing cash against Bitcoin (BTC), 53% against Ethereum (ETH), and 6% against DeFi tokens.

The company has recently introduced a VIP-exclusive feature to offer flexible lending conditions and the ability to use decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens as collateral for institutional clients on the crypto-backed lending platform.

Furthermore, to best serve institutional customers, the requests and queries of VIP clients are handled individually by dedicated personal managers on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Interestingly, 14% of CEX.IO VIP customers have already asked their personal managers about borrowing funds via the crypto-backed lending service.

“As institutional investors find the digital asset industry increasingly attractive, it’s a pleasure to serve them with our enterprise-grade instant crypto-backed loan platform. Security, convenience, and compliance are key priorities for corporate clients, which are features that we have been providing to all our clients in the rapidly growing CEX.IO ecosystem. Most importantly, we want to provide institutional clients with the best service. For that reason, VIP clients enjoy exclusive benefits, such as dedicated personal managers and flexible lending options, on the CEX.IO LOAN platform,” Anton Chashchin, Commercial Director for the CEX.IO LOAN service, stated.

In the announcement, the firm revealed further details about the size of the funds clients borrow on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Based on the company’s data, while retail investors borrow $1,400 on average, VIP clients request larger-sized loans that vary in size, with the typical amount being $1 million or higher.

Institutional clients do not just borrow more but also need the funds for more extended periods which usually range between 6 and 12 months. According to the company, this phenomenon indicates a long-term strategy for VIP clients to manage their assets.

PRESS RELEASE. PARSIQ, a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform connecting on-chain and off-chain applications in real-time, announced that its PRQ token is now listed on OKEx with USDT base pair.

Please take note of the following go-live schedule:

PRQ Deposit : 07:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Spot Trading : PRQ / USDT : 10:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Withdrawal : 10:00 January 29, 2021 (UTC)

PARSIQ is a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform that serves as a multi-level bridge between blockchains and off-chain applications. PARSIQ’s features automate the blockchain analytics and monitoring process, providing customizable workflows with real-time intelligence.

Developers and individual users can transform the blockchain data to their favorite off-chain application or web service.

Among the obvious use cases is monitoring the wallets of traders and ordinary users. Among the non-obvious are complex system integrations for financial institutions and DeFi projects that use the PARSIQ infrastructure to improve security, conduct audits, comply with regulatory requirements, AML, and expand their workflows in other ways.

The infrastructure underneath PARSIQ’s user interface is built with their proprietary programming language ParsiQL, and its users’ benefits are multiplying with each supported integration.

PRQ Token

PARSIQ Token (PRQ) is an essential piece of the PARSIQ platform that co-exists with FIAT payments for using its services. Payments within the platform that are made in PRQ tokens guarantee a discounted rate. During the first Epoch when PRQ tokens are used as payment for running Smart-Triggers users receive higher execution limits, unlock transport methods, and are able to propose features that can be added to the platform.

In October 2020, the PARSIQ team released plans for Epoch 2.0.

#1. Public Projects

With Public Projects users can subscribe to existing PARSIQ Projects that were pre-made by other users. By paying in PRQ, users that have subscribed to the Public Project will incentivize the creators to create interesting, complex, and more important – problem-solving projects.

#2. User Data and PRQ

Every single monitoring target (primitive of type address, a struct with the field of address type, table row) would require 1 PRQ to hold after the implementation. It means that if there are 1000 addresses (960 in the table as rows, 30 as primitives, 10 in the structs) then the User would need 1000 PRQ on the connected Ethereum Account balance.

#3. IQ Protocol

IQ Protocol will allow risk-free PRQ lending and collateral-less borrowing. Risk-free PRQ lending means that PRQ is not transferred from the lender’s address to the borrower’s address. Details on the algorithm are available in the dedicated explainer on PARSIQ’s blog.

#4. PRQBoost

PRQ Boost is a liquidity boost program to incentivize PRQ/ETH liquidity providers on Uniswap, which goes with the PRQBOOST utility tokens to increase rewards for liquidity providers.

PARSIQ is actively working to partner with major layer 1 blockchain protocols to expand the range of blockchain integrations and give projects that build on those protocols the ability to monitor and automate workflows between blockchain and off-chain.

PRESS RELEASE. YFX, the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts has just launched, adding an important piece to the DeFi money legos, and creating a direct competition against CEX on derivatives trading.

The most traded Bitcoin product in centralized exchanges is Bitcoin futures, which is 10 times bigger than spot trading in terms of the trading volume. But in DEX, spot trading platforms like Uniswap are occupying a large portion of the total trading volume, and there is not a single decentralized futures trading platform that could reach even 1/10 of Uniswap’s trading volume. What stops decentralized futures trading platforms from becoming 10 times bigger than Uniswap? Why are decentralized futures trading platforms performing worse than their centralized counterparts?

The main reason is that decentralized futures exchanges don’t currently provide an attractive futures product to compete with centralized futures exchanges. For instance, centralized futures exchanges like BitMex can provide 100x leverage on Bitcoin futures trading. On the other hand, decentralized futures exchanges like dYdX only offer 10x leverage. None of the decentralized exchanges can keep up with the 100x leverage offering from centralized exchanges.

YFX Descartes V1 uses QIC-AMM and a system de-risk mechanism to migrate perpetual futures trading from CEX to DEX without reducing the trading leverage, which makes YFX the first DEX that could offer 100x leverage on a perpetual contract. You can do everything on YFX that you can do on BitMex or OKEx. YFX is poised to compete directly against established centralized exchanges. YFX Descartes V1 runs on the TRON MainNet, for faster transaction times and cheaper gas fees compared to Ethereum. The YFX team is also working on Ethereum’s Layer 2 solution to provide pragmatic perpetual trading on DEX. YFX team plans to launch their DEX on Huobi Heco and Ethereum Test net in Q1, 2021.

About YFX

YFX is the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts. YFX Descartes V1 launched on the TRON MainNet, and all trades are held and processed by smart contracts. The main goal of the YFX team, which is formed by a group of engineers who have years of experience working on trading systems and blockchain, is to build a DEX that can compete with CEX on derivative trading.

The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) has posted a job advertisement that seeks to hire a role related to stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDC). The Fed is looking for a research manager to join its team to assess the “benefits and risks” of digital assets.

The Role Is Part of the Fed’s Digital Innovation Policy

Per the Linkedin job posting, the Federal Reserve Board expects the selected candidate to manage the “Digital Innovation Policy Program.” The department oversees “all aspects of a program focused on emerging issues at the intersection of technology and payments.”

The Fed highlights in the post, the “changing nature” of payment platforms in a digital environment. However, the role is not limited to doing in-depth research on how digital assets could benefit the economy.

In fact, the U.S. Federal Reserve is aiming with the research manager of the Digital Innovation Policy Program to address “regulatory framework for emerging payments platforms” issues.

The job advertisement also adds:

These topics require the Program to take into account diverse views across the Board and the Reserve Banks, necessitating a significant investment of time and resources in collaboration and communication across relevant bodies as well as the ability to cooperate with a range of domestic and international partners on digital innovations topics.

As of press time, there are 28 applicants interested via the Linkedin job posting.

Latest Developments on Stablecoins and CBDCs in the United States

The Fed has been recently treading waters on CBDCs through Jerome Powell’s speeches, the Federal Reserve chairman. During an online event at Princeton University in New Jersey earlier in January, Powell expressed that the American central bank is in no rush to be the first to work in a CBDC.

Moreover, the Fed’s chairman stressed that it could “take years” before the U.S. Federal Reserve releases a central bank digital currency.

In December 2020, three U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill that will force private stablecoin issuers to obtain a banking charter (or license) and get approval from the Fed before they can issue a stablecoin.

This past week, another social media trend started on the Reddit forum r/wallstreetbets, which aims to initiate a large silver short squeeze in order to push the price of the precious metal to $1,000 per ounce. However, the silver squeeze trend comes with controversy, as numerous wallstreetbets supporters believe hedge funds like Melvin Capital and Citadel are behind the silver push.

The Controversial ‘Silver Squeeze’

During the last week, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the wallstreetbets (WSB) saga taking place on social media forums and the infamous subreddit r/wallstreetbets. Since the mega short squeeze on the Gamestop (GME) shares, the squeeze maneuver has also spilled into a number of other stocks. This week, shares from the Russell 3000 Index (RUA) were targeted including tickers like NOK, GOGO, AMCX, and FIZZ. But the trend didn’t stop there, as one post, in particular, had called for a “silver squeeze.” The WSB Reddit post called for the silver squeeze to push the price of silver from $25 per ounce to $1,000.

Now since the post was published, the Reddit admins in charge of moderating r/wallstreetbets removed the post. But that was long after the message was made viral by the participants discussing the pros and cons of attempting to squeeze silver. Now the reason people think the silver short squeeze post may be shady, is because a number of WSB Redditors believe the silver squeeze was invoked by the hedge funds losing money in order to cover their GME losses. There are a great number of Reddit posts warning that people should not participate in the silver short squeeze.

One post said:

Citadel is the 5th largest owner of [silver], it’s imperative we do not ‘squeeze’ it. These are hedge fund bots spamming awards.

The people who dislike the silver trend on WSB, have also warned that Melvin Capital Management is also a big silver holder. Unfortunately, it is hard to tell where the silver pump threads and posts are stemming from, as there are many free-market supporters who are fans of the precious metal sometimes referred to as the ‘poor man’s gold.’

Despite this, there are numbers of WSB fans and Redditors claiming the silver pump stemmed from hedge fund people and they believe there are imposters everywhere now. Some of these people are growing irrational, getting mad at anyone who posts about silver. Many WSB supporters might be feeling the pain from Gamestop Corp. shares dropping significantly on Monday.

Silver soars past $30 a troy ounce as Reddit-fuelled buying frenzy continues for 3rd day. #Silversqueeze pic.twitter.com/mLmasUBrq1 — Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) February 1, 2021

In Spite of Controversy, Something Is Sparking Silver Demand

Despite the speculation, some sort of demand was invoked when it comes to silver prices and obtaining physical bullion. For instance, if you are attempting to purchase an ounce or ounces of silver bullion online, the process is far more complicated now than it was last week. A large portion of bars and coins are either sold out or the prices are marked up considerably.

This is simple arbitrage. #Silver futures are 28.67. Silver Eagles on Apmex are $41.66, thats a 45% premium to futures. Obvious opportunity to buy futures & stand for delivery for a 35% discount on physical right? But when they don't have it, Futures = $41.66/oz. #silversqueeze — Jonathan #SILVERSQUEEZE Mergott (@Jmergz1985) February 1, 2021

All the American Eagles are sold out across a number of bullion dealers. On Sunday morning, a few big-name dealers have halted a great number of silver sales. News.Bitcoin.com’s most recent WSB report disclosed how SD Bullion sold nearly 10x the number of silver ounces than usual. People visiting bullion dealer websites like Provident, Apmex, and JD Bullion could see the unprecedented demand targeting physical silver.

“In the last week, we have seen a dramatic shift in Silver demand from our customers,” said Ken Lewis CEO of the bullion dealer Apmex. “For example, the ratio of ounces sold per day was running about two times earlier in the week and closer to four times the average demand by the end of the week,” Lewis added.

The Apmex CEO further stressed:

Once markets closed on Friday, we saw demand hit as much as six times a typical business day and more than 12 times a normal weekend day. Combined with the extremely high demand levels, we are also seeing a surge in new customers. On Saturday alone, we added as many new customers as we usually add in a week.

Additionally, the hashtag “#silversqueeze” has been trending throughout the United States and a few other countries on Twitter during the last 48 hours. By the late afternoon on Sunday, spot silver and futures traded at $27 per Troy ounce, and by Monday morning spot silver traded 7.7% higher at $29.76. The commodity hopped above the $30 region, and silver prices per ounce exchanged hands at $30.35 an ounce. One ounce of .999 silver is hovering in the $29 price handle at the time of publication

CHAPTER ONE: Listening to the Past

“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.” — Satoshi Nakamoto

The trusted third party problem has haunted modern financial systems and centralized exchanges because people require an intermediary to make them work. The third party’s good or bad motives become a defining aspect of the transaction, and the those who use the institutions are at the mercy of those intentions. This is especially true of the current system of state-issued money and central banking.

A trustless system avoids intermediaries and does not depend upon the intentions of participants; that is, the system functions in the same manner regardless of anyone’s intentions. The blockchain, with a transparent and immutable peer-to peer protocol, is called trustless because there is no corruptible intermediary upon whom exchanges must depend.

On a small scale, the trusted third party problem may always exist because a middleman is useful or necessary in some situations. If third parties offer competitive services on a free market, however, the damage of dishonesty or incompetence is limited. People can take their business elsewhere, report a swindler to watchdogs, warn others, and file a lawsuit.

An occasionally dishonest third party is not the problem Satoshi addresses. He speaks to the institutionalized corruption of government and central banks from which the average person could not escape by using a competitor or by suing. Almost everyone who works over the table, runs a business, buys or sells goods, accepts government benefits or pays taxes has had to accept a fiat that constantly plunges in value due to inflation. Almost everyone who uses credit, accepts checks, takes out loans, conducts commerce or does business abroad has needed to go through banks that steal like drunken muggers.

For average people, the situation used to seem hopeless because no legal, practical, and private alternative existed for transferring funds across considerable distance, including borders. Attempts to reform or remove the system also seemed doomed because it was inherently corrupt and self-serving. In fact, fiat and central banking were serving the purpose for which they had been established: financial control by elites. People’s need for money and exchange became their straitjackets.

Then Satoshi. Then the blockchain and crypto. A new concept of money was created in a form that cannot not be inflated; the number of bitcoins is fixed at 21 million divisible units. The supply can only decrease when coins are lost, as inevitably happens. Satoshi notes, “Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.” Bitcoin solved the fiat problem.

A new concept of financial transfer solved the third party problem, especially with regard to banks. Although peer-to-peer transactions involve a middleman or miner, no trust is required since the transaction is released only when “proof of work” is rendered, which consists of solving a complicated math problem. Arriving at a solution may be costly in computer power and time, but the solutions themselves are easy to verify. Satoshi comments, “With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.” The soundness and propriety of the blockchain’s protocol itself is assured by the use of open source that is visible to all and verifiable. The political outcome: A private currency and method of exchange freed people from financial oppression.

The idea of private currency itself is hardly new, however.

Precedent in Radical Individualist Theory

The late Friedrich Hayek is the most respected Austrian economist of the 20th century. His book The Denationalisation of Money: An Analysis of the Theory and Practice of Concurrent Currencies argues vigorously for private and competitive currencies to displace government-issued ones. Hayek ponders a key question. “When one studies the history of money one cannot help wondering why people should have put up for so long with governments exercising an exclusive power over two thousand years that was regularly used to exploit and defraud them. This can be explained only by the myth” that government money was necessary “becoming so firmly established that it did not occur even to the professional students of these matters…ever to question it. But once the validity of the established doctrine is doubted its foundation is rapidly seen to be fragile.”

Governments reap incredible profits from debasing the currency, but the rigged game works only if people have no alternative but to play it. The political purpose of legal tender and banking laws is to grant a monopoly to the state, which permits the redistribution of wealth and power from average people upward to the elite of society. Fiat money and banking remains fragile, however, because the system relies on people either not understanding the dynamics or not having a choice. Hayek wonders why public understanding is so elusive. Why was “a government monopoly of the provision of money…universally regarded as indispensable” and what would happen “if the provision of money were thrown open to the competition of private concerns supplying different currencies?”

With eerie prescience, Hayek argues for currencies developed by entrepreneurs who innovate new forms of money just as they innovate in other areas. One of the drawbacks of government’s monopoly is that it imposes a freeze on the sort of invention that now runs free in crypto. The voluntaryist historian Carl Watner observes, “No one can tell in advance what form these monies might take because no one can know for sure what choices individuals would make or what new technologies might be discovered. Laws forcing people to use the Federal Reserve System money have frozen monetary developments at a certain stage…Just imagine if Congress had protected the Post Office by passing laws that would have prevented people from communicating via the internet. We would never have experienced the marvels of e-mail.”

The late Austrian economist Murray Rothbard also wrestles with the question of “why do people so vigorously resist private currencies?” His book For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto advances an explanation. “If the government and only the government had had a monopoly of the shoe manufacturing and retailing business, how would most of the public treat the libertarian who now came along to advocate that the government get out of the shoe business and throw it open to private enterprise?” Rothbard predicts that the skeptics would attack the libertarian for depriving them of the only possible source of shoes—the government. People are thoroughly indoctrinated to believe that daily life cannot function without the state and fiat.

Hayek and Rothbard are unusual among free-market economists in their embrace of private money and monetary systems. Even laissez-faire zealots rarely champion free-market currencies or private banking. Instead, they debate marginal issues such as fractional reserve and other reforms they think will improve the existing system. Or they argue for the restoration of a gold standard as though it were a panacea. But if a gold standard were applied to fiat, the system would still require people to trust the government and banks. This means trusting both institutions to act against their own interests, which they have historically neglected to do.

The modern neglect of free-market money and banking is odd because 19th century radical individualists focused intensely on the importance of private money and private banking to personal freedom. They placed a primal emphasis on the right of every individual to create his own currency and to function as his own bank. It was a natural right as important as freedom of speech or of religion. The pivotal individualist Benjamin Tucker believed that the right to issue private currency was so important that it could destroy the State all by itself. His reasoning: The money monopoly, including control of credit, was how the State sustained itself and robbed average people not merely of wealth but also of economic opportunity.

Two specific events sculpted the approach that the early individualist-anarchists adopted toward the monetary monopoly. One was the Panic of 1837 that tipped the United States into recession until the mid-1840s. Commonly cited causes of the Panic include a collapsing land bubble and a sharp fall in cotton prices. Blame is also placed at the feet of President Andrew Jackson for vetoing the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States and precipitating an unfortunate chain of economic events. Drawing on the work of Professor of Economics Peter Temin, Rothbard disputes this interpretation.

First, he [Temin] points out that the price inflation really began earlier, when wholesale prices reached a trough of 82 in July 1830 and then rose by 20.7 percent in three years to reach 99 in the fall of 1833. The reason for the price rise is simple: The total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $159 million in 1833, an increase of 45.9 percent, or an annual rise of 15.3 percent. Breaking the figures down further, the total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $155 million a year and a half later, a spectacular expansion of 35 percent. Unquestionably, this monetary expansion was spurred by the still-flourishing Bank of the United States, which increased its notes and deposits from January 1830 to January 1832 from a total of $29 million to $42.1 million, a rise of 45.2 percent. Thus, the price and money inflation in the first few years of the 1830s were again sparked by the expansion of the still-dominant central bank.

Arguably, the Panic began in May 1837 when banks in New York City announced they would not redeem commercial paper for specie at full face value. Of the approximately 800 banks in America, all but six ceased at one point or another to redeem banknotes and deposits for gold or silver coins. Suspicion and hatred of traditional banks and government-issued money soared, with radicals scrutinizing alternate systems.

The other event dramatically to impact the radical fever from monetary reform was the Civil War for which the North financed its fighting through Legal Tender Acts and the National Banking Act of 1863.

The radicals did not merely theorize; they experimented with private currencies and new economic models. Their efforts are fascinating, but they are also cautionary tales. A major problem for 19th-century individualist-anarchism was the movement’s general acceptance of a link between sound money and the labor theory of value. This theory states that the true value of a good or service is based on the labor required to produce it rather than the price at which a seller and buyer are willing to exchange. In short, a good has intrinsic and not subjective value. (More on this in the section on the Regression Theorem.) Happily, their main economic goal was the abolition of the “money monopoly.” The term referred to three different but interacting forms of monopoly: banking, the charging of interest, and the privileged issuance of currency. The abolition of state power over currency was the focus, and they eschewed the use of force to implement their own schemes.

Josiah Warren provided a real-world example of what was meant by a currency that rested on the labor theory of value. Credited with being the first American anarchist, Warren tested his specific solution to the money monopoly through a Time Store from which he issued “Labor Notes.” In 1827, the business opened with $300 worth of groceries and dry goods that were offered at a 7 percent markup from Warren’s own costs in order to cover expenses such as overhead. This was before groceries were prepackaged or preweighed, and it was usual for buyers to bargain with the shopkeeper rather than pay a posted price. One of

Warren’s innovations was to post prices, which drove costs lower because transactions consumed less time. The customer paid in traditional money for the goods and paid with a Labor Note to compensate Warren for his time. The Labor Note obliged the customer to provide Warren with an equivalent amount of his time. If the buyer was a seamstress, for example, the Labor Note committed her to render to Warren X units of time to produce clothing. Warren’s goal was to establish an economy—or to establish a proof of principle, at least—in which profit was based on the exchange of time and labor. The Labor Notes were circulated and traded widely with in the community.

To some degree, Warren succeeded. People traveled from a hundred miles away to avail themselves of the Time Store’s low prices. After a few years, he declared the experiment to be a success and closed the store. Whether the Labor Notes were a success is questionable, however. The store itself may well have succeeded due to its low prices, not to the Notes. Whichever explanation is true, it is difficult to see how this novel currency could function in dense populations or on a grander scale of commerce. Few people today would be convinced of the viability of private money based on the Time Store experiment.

What could convince the public and economists that private currencies work as well or better than government-issued ones? Going back a bit further in American history is a good place to start because the future is always based on the past.

21Shares AG, a Zurich-based investment provider, is launching what is being dubbed as the world’s first Polkadot exchange-traded product, or ETP.

The DOT ETP will be listed on the Swiss exchange SIX on Thursday, February 4, said the company in a statement on Tuesday. DOT is the native token of the Polkadot network.

DOT has since been added to 21Shares’ Crypto Basket ETP (HODL), which tracks five major assets including bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH). Since its addition on Jan. 29, DOT now accounts for 27% of the product behind BTC at 50%.

Hany Rashwan, chief executive officer of 21Shares, said the firm has seen “unprecedented demand” from institutional investors wanting exposure to crypto-assets. He stated that demand for its range of crypto ETPs has soared 500% since the third quarter of 2020, but there has been “a recent surge in interest” for DOT.

“After investors purchase their first bitcoins through our ETPs, there is a natural transition to invest in other crypto assets,” Rashwan detailed.

“We benefit from trusted partners for the liquidity provision and upon continued institutional demand, we are launching the DOT ETP to give investors a safe, regulated, and easy way to obtain exposure to this exciting new blockchain technology,” he added.

Rashwan revealed that 21Shares, an issuer of exchange-traded products, is planning to add up to three ETPs over the next 3 months. He said European investors have been approaching the company to launch new products.

Created by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Polkadot is a cross-blockchain that enables transfers of any type of data or asset, not just tokens. It is also used as an electronic payment system.

DOT is now the world’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market capitalization of $16.55 billion, according to data from markets.Bitcoin.com. At the time of writing, DOT is trading at $17.22, up 8% over the past 24 hours.

Ukraine’s government-owned nuclear power plant picked a firm to build a massive data center in Rivne for cryptocurrency mining operations. After a bidding process, Energoatom chose Kyiv Energy Construction Company to handle the nuclear plant crypto mining project.

Nuclear Power Plant Operator Expects to Launch the Data Center in 2022

According to official documents, the data center will be based in the Rivne nuclear power plant, after the construction firm got 8.92 million Hryvnia ($317,620) in funding. The only competitor in the bidding was Ukrenergobudproek. However, they allegedly made an expensive offer, said the regional news outlet Forklog.

The Kyiv Energy Construction Company expects to finish the data center building by August 31, 2022. Per the announcement, the contractor is required to send the documentation that details the whole process. It includes “host state registers, electronic archives, and computing facilities.”

In terms of technical details, the nuclear power plant has a capacity of 2,657 megawatts, and it was built in the late 1970s. Also, the operations of the state-owned nuclear facilities started at the beginning of 1980.

In October 2020, Energoatom also signed a memorandum with a subsidiary of crypto mining giant Bitfury. With the new data center, local media outlets believe Bitfury miners could move their operations into the power plant’s facilities.

Ukraine’s Interest Towards Building Crypto Mining Data Centers in Nuclear Plants

The deal between Energoatom and Kyiv Energy Construction Company is not a surprising move. In fact, the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine asked Energoatom in May 2020 to conduct research to assess crypto mining’s feasibility at their nuclear plants.

As an anecdotal fact in terms of crypto mining in Ukrainian nuclear plants, the nation’s Security Service found illegal crypto mining equipment in a nuclear power plant in 2019.

The installation’s illegal mining rigs were found in the Southern region of Ukraine. Moreover, the investigations determined that such illegal equipment breached a “state secret.”

Global music distribution service Ditto has unveiled the latest addition to its service lineup for musicians with a blockchain-based financing platform named Opulous.

Opulous Peer-to-Peer Lending Platform Serves as a Loan Pool Designed to Help Artists

Ditto continues its efforts to improve the value chain for artists. Unlike other decentralized finance (defi) protocols, Opulous reflects asset-based lending, which bridges the physical and digital worlds. The Opulous’ defi lending mechanism, which is being developed on the Algorand public blockchain, leverages music copyrights’ tangibility through a smart contract setup that automatically handles principal and interest payments along with distributions to investors.

For musicians already receiving royalties, this presents a unique opportunity to monetize their assets or contribute to the pool to stake other artists. When seeking capital, artists can access funds by collateralizing loans from Opulous’ Music Copyright Pools with their music royalties.

Besides digitizing music as an asset class, the move will invite more democratized participation from artists and investors seeking to gain a foothold in the music industry, which is undergoing tremendous annual growth and expected to double in size by 2030. Artists benefit from interest rates starting as low as 4%, while investors in the copyright pools can add exposure to music royalties as an asset class for 10% returns per annum.

Per Ditto CEO Lee Parsons,

Opulous cuts out traditional banking, providing musicians with a platform with minimal interest payments, while giving investors the chance to stake a claim in one of the most exciting and fastest-growing financial industries in the world.

Ditto, which has already processed more than $1 billion in royalties for its 250,000-plus users, sees industry revenues doubling in the next ten years, building a compelling investment thesis. In keeping with Opulous’ mission to democratize musicians’ financial access, users outside the Ditto ecosystem are welcome to join the peer-to-peer lending framework.

Opulous has raised $1.5 million in funding to-date from BASIC, Borderless Capital, Kosmos Capital, Somesing, and TrustVerse. Roll out of the platform’s minimum viable product (MVP) is anticipated in two months as development proceeds.

Elastos, which built its decentralized application (dapp) platform and currency (ELA) to protect users’ digital assets and creations, will be among the first token staking partners for Opulous’ proof-of-stake consensus protocol. Opulous, in concert with Elastos, will allow investors to stake their Elastos (ELA) coins within the Music Copyright Pools.

According to Clarence Liu, the VP of Development at the Elastos Foundation,

Elastos and Ditto Music have been researching how blockchain can address fundamental inefficiencies in the music industry. Access to funding – which Opulous will address – is only the tip of the iceberg.

“Our collaboration has much more in the pipeline and our community is definitely set on using the forward momentum sparked by recent world events to introduce new users to the decentralized internet ideals set by Elastos,” Liu concludes.

During the last year, Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem has grown exponentially to form a multi Billion Dollar market. As Decentralized Finance expands, it becomes more and more relevant to have cross-chain connections that enable crypto assets to flow instantly and seamlessly across blockchain networks. These make it possible for DeFi platforms to be an effective alternative to centralized exchanges. Today, pNetwork launches the first EOS to Ethereum cross-chain connection to enable the EOS crypto asset to be moved into Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem.

EOS on Ethereum

EOS, the native token on the EOS blockchain, is a top20 cryptocurrency by market cap and the engine powering one of the most active dApps ecosystems. The asset counts over $ 3.5 Billion in daily trading volumes, figuring as the 9th most traded cryptocurrency. At present, only a fraction of the total is happening in a decentralized fashion.

While the DeFi ecosystem on EOS continues to grow, it has not yet reached Ethereum’s size. The latter powers Billions in daily trading volumes, Uniswap being the largestlarges liquidity protocol in existence and the fourth biggest DeFi protocol in terms of Total Value Locked.

Following the delivery of 26 bridges connecting six different blockchain protocols, including the cross-chain transfer of popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin, pNetwork launches today a new cross-chain connection that brings EOS to Ethereum.

As the first tokenised version of EOS, pEOS makes the asset compatible with Ethereum’s DeFi. This creates a benefit on both sides, enabling Ethereum’s DeFi protocols to expand their range of assets supported and granting EOS the option to be traded in a decentralized fashion as well as being supported as a collateral type by major Ethereum-based landing platforms.

Cross-chain connections are critical for a variety of use-cases, from NFTs to market making to decentralized indexes such as PieDAO’s Pies. pNetwork-powered asset tokenisation on Ethereum enables such indexes to represent the entire crypto market.

All pTokenised assets are pegged 1:1 to their underlying asset and are available for automated minting or redeeming on the pTokens dApp. In addition, pTokens are supported on a variety of DeFi protocols, decentralized exchanges and wallets on a growing number of blockchains.

Making Ethereum and EOS dApps Interoperable

Ethereum and EOS are two of the most active ecosystems for dApps, counting thousands of users each. By connecting these two blockchain environments, pNetwork aims to support the growth and development of decentralized applications such as lending/borrowing, trading, derivatives, and more. Acting as a cross-chain highway for cryptocurrencies to frictionlessly move from one blockchain to another, pNetwork powers the first bi-directional connection between the Ethereum and EOS blockchains.

Users on either blockchain are now able to interact with both ecosystems without ever leaving their blockchain of choice. Projects from both Ethereum and EOS communities have developed building blocks to create the next-generation financial system – with the connection between these two, users will find an even more powerful DeFi ecosystem.

By leveraging pNetwork’s cross-chain solution, dApps on the two blockchain platforms now have the opportunity to interoperate. Each ecosystem leveraging its counterpart’s strengths ultimately creates a benefit on both sides and sets the basis for sustainable growth. The presence of an EOS/ETH decentralized trading pair both with Ethereum’s and EOS’s decentralized finance, for example, makes it possible for market makers to arbitrage between the two blockchains. This results in a more liquid decentralized market for both assets.

Adopting dogecoin as a payment method was not as part as just of a crypto adoption-driven maneuver. The company praised the popularity of the token and its uniqueness within the industry.

Also, Kronos pointed out that dogecoins transactions’ speed is a positive note for the Shiba Inu inspired meme token. So far, the company accepts several cryptos as payment methods, such as bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), litecoin (LTC), among others.

Expanding N95 Mask Market Into the Dogecoin Community

Michael Rubinov, president of Kronos Advanced Technologies, commented on the company’s stance towards cryptocurrencies:

In the last ten years, much has been said about how cryptocurrency will revolutionize payments, services, businesses and will change the world the way we know it. Cryptocurrency has changed e-commerce: as more and more people now shop online. Cryptocurrency gives customers more reasons to utilize the convenience of online shopping, as it mitigates the risk of fraud for both vendors and shoppers.

By adopting dogecoin as a form of payment, Kronos also expect to market N95 masks to the entire meme coin community on Reddit, which has grown over 670,000 members. The company also praised the fact that Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk endorses dogecoin as one of his favorite cryptocurrencies.

Despite the recent frenzy seen in the meme coin, the latest markets.Bitcoin.com data shows that dogecoin is exchanging hands at $0.0317, down -20.43% on Tuesday. The market capitalization still stands at $4.08 billion.

Spacex and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been trying to get to the bottom of what happened with the popular trading app Robinhood when it stopped people from buying shares of hot stocks, like Gamestop. The shares of these stocks became popular due to the Wallstreetbets movement.

Elon Musk Says People Want the Truth From Robinhood

During an interview on The Good Time Show via the Clubhouse app Sunday night, Elon Musk grilled the CEO of trading app Robinhood, Vlad Tenev, over the company’s decision to restrict hot stocks last week, including Gamestop. On Friday, Robinhood also restricted crypto trading, citing “extraordinary market conditions.”

“What happened last week? Why can’t people buy the Gamestop shares? The people demand an answer and they want to know the details and the truth,” Musk said.

Tenev began by explaining the structure of his company. “Robinhood is actually a couple of companies,” he described. Robinhood Financial processes trades, Robinhood Securities clears and settles the trades, and Robinhood Crypto which deals with crypto trades.

The Robinhood CEO detailed that last Wednesday, his platform experienced “unprecedented volume” as “a lot of these so-called meme stocks were going viral on social media and people were joining Robinhood” to buy these stocks. Consequently, the company “received a file” from the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) Thursday morning at about 3:30 AM PST. It requested Robinhood to “put up money to the NSCC based on some factors,” including the volatility of certain securities. Tenev clarified that “this is the equities business so it’s based on stock trading and not options trading or anything else,” elaborating:

They gave us a file with a deposit and the request was around $3 billion dollars which is about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is.

Musk interrupted Tenev, questioning: “Why is that so high? It sounds like this is an unprecedented increase in demand for capital. What formula did they use to calculate that?”

Tenev replied: “We don’t have the full details. It’s a little bit of an opaque formula but there’s a component called the VAR of it, which is the Value at Risk, and that’s based on kind of some fairly quantitative things … and then there’s a special component which is discretionary so that kind of acts as a multiplier.” Tenev also noted that up until that point, his company “has raised a little bit around two billion dollars in total venture capital,” so the request was “a big number.”

The Tesla CEO interrupted again, asking: “What everyone wants to know is did something maybe shady go down here? It seems weird that you’d get a sudden $10 billion demand in the morning … suddenly out of nowhere.” Tenev swiftly corrected Musk that the number was $3 billion. The Robinhood CEO then emphasized:

I wouldn’t impugn shadiness to it or anything like that, and actually the NSCC was reasonable subsequent to this. They worked with us to actually lower it. It was unprecedented activity.

Musk abruptly asked Tenev: “Is there anyone holding you hostage right now?” Tenev chuckled and replied: “No, no, I’m okay. Thanks for asking.” Both laughed.

The Robinhood CEO proceeded to explain what happened, calling the experience “nerve-wrecking.” He said after receiving the request for $3 billion, his chief operating officer called up someone higher up at the NSCC to discuss what to do. “There was another call and they lowered it to something like $1.4 billion from $3 billion,” Tenev reiterated that it was still a high number. His company then proposed a plan to the NSCC of “marking these volatile stocks that were kind of driving the activity position-closing only.”

Then, at about 5 to 5:30 AM PST, before the market opened, the NSCC came back and reduced the deposit requirement to $700 million, “which we then deposited and paid promptly,” Tenev emphasized. Acknowledging that the move was bad for customers, the Robinhood CEO said, “We had no choice, in this case. We had to conform to our regulatory capital requirements and so the team did what they could to make sure we were available for customers.”

The Spacex CEO further questioned: “Who controls this organization, this clearinghouse?” Tenev replied: “It’s a consortium. It’s not quite a government agency. I don’t really know the details of all of that.” Nonetheless, he emphasized that “To be fair … I think there was legitimate sort of turmoil in the markets … so there probably is some amount of extra risk in the system that warrants higher requirements so it’s not entirely unreasonable.” He noted that lots of other brokers were in the same situation and had to restrict the same activity.

“So it sounds like this organization calls you up and they basically have a gun to your head: either hand over this money or else,” the Spacex CEO summarized, elaborating:

Basically, what people are wondering is did you sell your clients down the river or did you have no choice. If you had no choice, that’s understandable but then we got to find out why you had no choice and who are these people that are saying you have no choice.

“I think that’s fair. We have to comply with these requirements. Financial institutions have requirements,” Tenev responded. Nonetheless, he suggested that it would be helpful to know the formula the NSCC uses to calculate these requirements so companies can plan better.

Musk proceeded to ask about whether there was outside pressure forcing Robinhood to take the action it did. Tenev affirmed that there is “a rumor that Citadel or other market makers kind of pressured us into doing this.” However, he clarified, “that’s just false,” emphasizing that “this was a clearinghouse decision and it was just based on the capital requirements so from our perspective Citadel and other market makers weren’t involved in that.”

During the same Clubhouse interview, Elon also revealed that he is a supporter of bitcoin and should have bought the cryptocurrency eight years ago. He believes that bitcoin is on the verge of getting broad acceptance by traditional finance people. On Monday, Robinhood raised another $2.4 billion from shareholders after it secured $1 billion last Thursday.

PRESS RELEASE. The AdGram service was founded a year ago and is currently the largest advertising exchange in Telegram.

AdGram helps brands place large advertising volumes in channels and groups quickly and efficiently. Channels and groups benefit from expansion of their audience, it is easy to find advertisers and increase the earnings from advertising placements via AdGram.

Over the last 12 months, the service has gained a huge experience in communications with both advertisers and administrators from different countries, which has highlighted issues with settlements in multiple currencies. After overcoming these obstacles, it was decided that cryptocurrency could be the key to solving this problem.

With the termination of the Telegram team’s work on the TON project in May 2020 (the messenger lost one of its monetization methods), Free TON was launched which took over the development and popularization of TON Crystal using the open source code from the original TON. The uniqueness of FreeTON is that it is one of the few projects where all the tokens belong to the community and it is developing as a decentralized autonomous organization.

The potential of the underlying technology and the growth of the community inspired AdGram and in October 2020 they partnered with the FreeTON Community and fully integrated Crystal as a means of payment. Synergy with FreeTON made it possible to take a big step towards using cryptocurrencies as a single, simple and clear means of payment.

The ability to pay with tokens for advertising in Telegram creates a powerful use case for the TON Crystal token. Huge and constantly growing volume of the advertising market is vital for tokenomics as it creates supply and demand for market participants, thereby increasing the liquidity of the token itself.

For administrators and advertisers transactions in TON Crystal is simple, convenient and fast! It also solves the problem of collecting details for transfers in various currencies, and avoids paying banking fees.

Advertising on Telegram and the FreeTON blockchain, which is the successor of Durov’s original (but never happened Durov’s TON), create a strong and impact-resistant synergy of mutual benefits. This shows markets and communities can develop in a self-regulated environment.

PRESS RELEASE. CEX.IO LOAN experiences massive institutional demand for its crypto-backed lending service, with 41% of customers requesting to borrow cash against Bitcoin, 53% against Ethereum, and 6% against DeFi tokens.

Crypto-backed lending service CEX.IO LOAN that launched in October 2020 in select global jurisdictions, has been experiencing major demand, receiving over $100 million worth of loan requests to date. While the service has been widely popular among retail investors, most of the platform’s loan requests came from institutional investors.

According to CEX.IO LOAN, such an increase in demand can be attributed to the institutionalization of the cryptocurrency industry. Institutional investors, who have cryptocurrencies in their possession, regard it as a potential collateral for borrowing funds and actively utilise it as such. The borrowed funds are then used for further investment purposes.

In addition to featuring cutting-edge security and advanced anti-fraud measures, CEX.IO Group operates a regulated service, which has been licensed as a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) provider by the Gibraltar Financial Service Commission (GFSC) since last year. In addition to this, the Government of Gibraltar recently granted CEX.IO Limited a Money Lender License, allowing the firm to extend its ecosystem of regulated services with CEX.IO LOAN.

Institutional clients also prefer the company’s digital asset-backed lending service due to the convenience offered to users. On the CEX.IO LOAN platform, customers can borrow cash against their cryptocurrency assets in a quick and simple manner, without having to deal with credit checks or any unnecessary paperwork. To access the company’s instant crypto-backed lending service, new users have to open an account at the digital asset exchange and pass the mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML checks.

CEX.IO LOAN serves various cryptocurrency market participants, from retail investors, traders, and HODLers to startups, entrepreneurs, and large enterprises. As part of a flexible crypto-backed lending service, users can borrow any amount between $500 and $100,000 at competitive interest rates starting at 8.75% per year. Loan duration ranging from seven days to one year.

Currently, retail users can borrow funds against their Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) assets. Based on the company’s data, the feature has already experienced high demand from VIP clients, with 41% of all CEX.IO LOAN customers borrowing cash against Bitcoin (BTC), 53% against Ethereum (ETH), and 6% against DeFi tokens.

The company has recently introduced a VIP-exclusive feature to offer flexible lending conditions and the ability to use decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens as collateral for institutional clients on the crypto-backed lending platform.

Furthermore, to best serve institutional customers, the requests and queries of VIP clients are handled individually by dedicated personal managers on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Interestingly, 14% of CEX.IO VIP customers have already asked their personal managers about borrowing funds via the crypto-backed lending service.

“As institutional investors find the digital asset industry increasingly attractive, it’s a pleasure to serve them with our enterprise-grade instant crypto-backed loan platform. Security, convenience, and compliance are key priorities for corporate clients, which are features that we have been providing to all our clients in the rapidly growing CEX.IO ecosystem. Most importantly, we want to provide institutional clients with the best service. For that reason, VIP clients enjoy exclusive benefits, such as dedicated personal managers and flexible lending options, on the CEX.IO LOAN platform,” Anton Chashchin, Commercial Director for the CEX.IO LOAN service, stated.

In the announcement, the firm revealed further details about the size of the funds clients borrow on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Based on the company’s data, while retail investors borrow $1,400 on average, VIP clients request larger-sized loans that vary in size, with the typical amount being $1 million or higher.

Institutional clients do not just borrow more but also need the funds for more extended periods which usually range between 6 and 12 months. According to the company, this phenomenon indicates a long-term strategy for VIP clients to manage their assets.

PRESS RELEASE. PARSIQ, a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform connecting on-chain and off-chain applications in real-time, announced that its PRQ token is now listed on OKEx with USDT base pair.

Please take note of the following go-live schedule:

PRQ Deposit : 07:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Spot Trading : PRQ / USDT : 10:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Withdrawal : 10:00 January 29, 2021 (UTC)

PARSIQ is a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform that serves as a multi-level bridge between blockchains and off-chain applications. PARSIQ’s features automate the blockchain analytics and monitoring process, providing customizable workflows with real-time intelligence.

Developers and individual users can transform the blockchain data to their favorite off-chain application or web service.

Among the obvious use cases is monitoring the wallets of traders and ordinary users. Among the non-obvious are complex system integrations for financial institutions and DeFi projects that use the PARSIQ infrastructure to improve security, conduct audits, comply with regulatory requirements, AML, and expand their workflows in other ways.

The infrastructure underneath PARSIQ’s user interface is built with their proprietary programming language ParsiQL, and its users’ benefits are multiplying with each supported integration.

PRQ Token

PARSIQ Token (PRQ) is an essential piece of the PARSIQ platform that co-exists with FIAT payments for using its services. Payments within the platform that are made in PRQ tokens guarantee a discounted rate. During the first Epoch when PRQ tokens are used as payment for running Smart-Triggers users receive higher execution limits, unlock transport methods, and are able to propose features that can be added to the platform.

In October 2020, the PARSIQ team released plans for Epoch 2.0.

#1. Public Projects

With Public Projects users can subscribe to existing PARSIQ Projects that were pre-made by other users. By paying in PRQ, users that have subscribed to the Public Project will incentivize the creators to create interesting, complex, and more important – problem-solving projects.

#2. User Data and PRQ

Every single monitoring target (primitive of type address, a struct with the field of address type, table row) would require 1 PRQ to hold after the implementation. It means that if there are 1000 addresses (960 in the table as rows, 30 as primitives, 10 in the structs) then the User would need 1000 PRQ on the connected Ethereum Account balance.

#3. IQ Protocol

IQ Protocol will allow risk-free PRQ lending and collateral-less borrowing. Risk-free PRQ lending means that PRQ is not transferred from the lender’s address to the borrower’s address. Details on the algorithm are available in the dedicated explainer on PARSIQ’s blog.

#4. PRQBoost

PRQ Boost is a liquidity boost program to incentivize PRQ/ETH liquidity providers on Uniswap, which goes with the PRQBOOST utility tokens to increase rewards for liquidity providers.

PARSIQ is actively working to partner with major layer 1 blockchain protocols to expand the range of blockchain integrations and give projects that build on those protocols the ability to monitor and automate workflows between blockchain and off-chain.

PRESS RELEASE. YFX, the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts has just launched, adding an important piece to the DeFi money legos, and creating a direct competition against CEX on derivatives trading.

The most traded Bitcoin product in centralized exchanges is Bitcoin futures, which is 10 times bigger than spot trading in terms of the trading volume. But in DEX, spot trading platforms like Uniswap are occupying a large portion of the total trading volume, and there is not a single decentralized futures trading platform that could reach even 1/10 of Uniswap’s trading volume. What stops decentralized futures trading platforms from becoming 10 times bigger than Uniswap? Why are decentralized futures trading platforms performing worse than their centralized counterparts?

The main reason is that decentralized futures exchanges don’t currently provide an attractive futures product to compete with centralized futures exchanges. For instance, centralized futures exchanges like BitMex can provide 100x leverage on Bitcoin futures trading. On the other hand, decentralized futures exchanges like dYdX only offer 10x leverage. None of the decentralized exchanges can keep up with the 100x leverage offering from centralized exchanges.

YFX Descartes V1 uses QIC-AMM and a system de-risk mechanism to migrate perpetual futures trading from CEX to DEX without reducing the trading leverage, which makes YFX the first DEX that could offer 100x leverage on a perpetual contract. You can do everything on YFX that you can do on BitMex or OKEx. YFX is poised to compete directly against established centralized exchanges. YFX Descartes V1 runs on the TRON MainNet, for faster transaction times and cheaper gas fees compared to Ethereum. The YFX team is also working on Ethereum’s Layer 2 solution to provide pragmatic perpetual trading on DEX. YFX team plans to launch their DEX on Huobi Heco and Ethereum Test net in Q1, 2021.

About YFX

YFX is the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts. YFX Descartes V1 launched on the TRON MainNet, and all trades are held and processed by smart contracts. The main goal of the YFX team, which is formed by a group of engineers who have years of experience working on trading systems and blockchain, is to build a DEX that can compete with CEX on derivative trading.

The Wall Street Bets saga, an incredibly ridiculous story about a group of amateur Reddit investors who beat career Wall Street hedge funds at their own game, is to be made into a movie.

According to a report by online news site Deadline on Jan. 31, Metro Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) won the rights to produce the film in a bidding war involving major Hollywood movie houses.

The movie is to be based on a book proposed by author Ben Mezrich. Mezrich’s previous work, “The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding Of Facebook, a Tale Of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal,” was adapted into the motion picture “The Social Network.”

The title to his planned latest book offering is called “The Antisocial Network,” said the report, quoting sources familiar with the development. The book is expected to go out to publishers later this February, it said.

However, it is not yet clear what shape or structure the movie will take. MGM’s Michael DeLuca will produce the film. DeLuca also produced the Academy-Award winning The Social Network. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss will executive produce via their Winklevoss Pictures production company.

The Wall Street Bets group noticed that major hedge funds on Wall Street had been placing short bets against companies they considered to be dying. The funds particularly targeted Gamestop, the world’s largest video game retailer, continually shorting the company’s shares.

But the Redditors saw an opportunity to make profit and collectively bet the other way, buying shares and stock options. This resulted in the value of the Gamestop shares soaring by more than 2,600% in January.

Hedge funds that had shorted the stock incurred losses running into several billions of dollars. One fund, Melvin Capital, reportedly lost up to $7 billion to the “short squeeze” in January, forcing it to restructure its investment portfolio to ensure a faster escape in future “squeezes.”

The Reddit traders also extended the pump to a few other stocks considered to be dying, including AMC (which climbed over 900% in January), as well as Nokia and Blackberry. This surge of activity resulted in a major controversy when the trading app Robinhood began restricting trade on certain stocks.

Alongside the cryptocurrency’s meteoric climb over the back half of 2020 and early 2021, a curious phenomenon has unfolded; heightened profit-taking and conversion to fiat currencies. Data collected by Simplex, a fiat-crypto gateway, underscores this seemingly paradoxical development.

A Curious Race to Convert Crypto to Fiat Has Accompanied Bitcoin’s Latest Drive Higher

Sharing exclusive data with Bitcoin.com, Simplex cofounder and chief analytics officer Netanel Kabala says:

While the international press coverage of Bitcoin’s rally has caused a swathe of new users to flock to the industry and buy-in, outflows have been equally significant. Of the total amount of cryptocurrency sold in the last six months, 43% was off ramped in December alone.

A quick look at Google Trends for the term ‘Bitcoin’ echoes these developments, especially now that new equity instruments like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and big-name funds like Blackrock are adding exposure and raising crypto awareness.

Still, given the increased ability to quickly convert crypto and withdraw in fiat currencies, the uptick in funds leaving the ecosystem is astonishing. Part of this can be attributed to the growing fungibility of cryptocurrency, primarily helped by the support of players like Simplex, which empowers users to buy, sell, and spend crypto through Visa partnerships.

Although some of the latest rally’s onlookers have decried the rapid rise in crypto valuations as proof that a bubble is forming in this nascent asset class, others within the industry see the development as a harbinger of times to come. One of the areas this is most apparent is altcoins.

Data compiled by Simplex illustrates that as Bitcoin prices have leveled off above $30,000, daily purchases of altcoins have risen by approximately 65%. More interestingly, the data highlights that newer users account for nearly 20% of this volume, marking a sharp increase in the number of novice retail investors expanding and diversifying their exposure within the ecosystem.

Poloniex, one of the top 20 global cryptocurrency exchanges, which has adopted Simplex’s platform, has experienced these results firsthand. Karen McHenry, Poloniex’s Director of Product, attributes this development to greater access within the ecosystem, especially with Simplex’s buy option, which promotes instant account funding alongside the heightened ability to cash out quickly.

She also doesn’t see the ability to more quickly convert from crypto to fiat as harming interest despite the eyepopping amounts taken off exchanges.

It may sound surprising, but adding the ‘sell’ option actually has a positive impact on the number of crypto transactions too.

Though this easy offramp and soaring volume of sell orders might seem negative for prices, it can also be viewed as a healthy reflection of the ecosystem’s growing use cases. Besides making it easier to exit and enter, growing areas like decentralized finance (defi) and greater fungibility all contribute to a cryptocurrency’s value proposition.

As institutions begin lining up to add exposure as retail accumulation climbs, Bitcoin momentum may actually accelerate, and by extension, lift the altcoins sought after by the newcomers seeking opportunities outside the seminal crypto coin.

McHenry adds:

If the bull market can maintain its momentum, some of these BTC profits will flow into altcoins, which are particularly popular among retail investors. This creates a positive feedback loop, with traders who turn a profit prone to telling their friends about crypto, which brings more investment into the space.

Do you think the offramping will continue throughout 2021? Let us know in the comments sections below.

This past week, another social media trend started on the Reddit forum r/wallstreetbets, which aims to initiate a large silver short squeeze in order to push the price of the precious metal to $1,000 per ounce. However, the silver squeeze trend comes with controversy, as numerous wallstreetbets supporters believe hedge funds like Melvin Capital and Citadel are behind the silver push.

The Controversial ‘Silver Squeeze’

During the last week, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the wallstreetbets (WSB) saga taking place on social media forums and the infamous subreddit r/wallstreetbets. Since the mega short squeeze on the Gamestop (GME) shares, the squeeze maneuver has also spilled into a number of other stocks. This week, shares from the Russell 3000 Index (RUA) were targeted including tickers like NOK, GOGO, AMCX, and FIZZ. But the trend didn’t stop there, as one post, in particular, had called for a “silver squeeze.” The WSB Reddit post called for the silver squeeze to push the price of silver from $25 per ounce to $1,000.

Now since the post was published, the Reddit admins in charge of moderating r/wallstreetbets removed the post. But that was long after the message was made viral by the participants discussing the pros and cons of attempting to squeeze silver. Now the reason people think the silver short squeeze post may be shady, is because a number of WSB Redditors believe the silver squeeze was invoked by the hedge funds losing money in order to cover their GME losses. There are a great number of Reddit posts warning that people should not participate in the silver short squeeze.

One post said:

Citadel is the 5th largest owner of [silver], it’s imperative we do not ‘squeeze’ it. These are hedge fund bots spamming awards.

The people who dislike the silver trend on WSB, have also warned that Melvin Capital Management is also a big silver holder. Unfortunately, it is hard to tell where the silver pump threads and posts are stemming from, as there are many free-market supporters who are fans of the precious metal sometimes referred to as the ‘poor man’s gold.’

Despite this, there are numbers of WSB fans and Redditors claiming the silver pump stemmed from hedge fund people and they believe there are imposters everywhere now. Some of these people are growing irrational, getting mad at anyone who posts about silver. Many WSB supporters might be feeling the pain from Gamestop Corp. shares dropping significantly on Monday.

Silver soars past $30 a troy ounce as Reddit-fuelled buying frenzy continues for 3rd day. #Silversqueeze pic.twitter.com/mLmasUBrq1 — Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) February 1, 2021

In Spite of Controversy, Something Is Sparking Silver Demand

Despite the speculation, some sort of demand was invoked when it comes to silver prices and obtaining physical bullion. For instance, if you are attempting to purchase an ounce or ounces of silver bullion online, the process is far more complicated now than it was last week. A large portion of bars and coins are either sold out or the prices are marked up considerably.

This is simple arbitrage. #Silver futures are 28.67. Silver Eagles on Apmex are $41.66, thats a 45% premium to futures. Obvious opportunity to buy futures & stand for delivery for a 35% discount on physical right? But when they don't have it, Futures = $41.66/oz. #silversqueeze — Jonathan #SILVERSQUEEZE Mergott (@Jmergz1985) February 1, 2021

All the American Eagles are sold out across a number of bullion dealers. On Sunday morning, a few big-name dealers have halted a great number of silver sales. News.Bitcoin.com’s most recent WSB report disclosed how SD Bullion sold nearly 10x the number of silver ounces than usual. People visiting bullion dealer websites like Provident, Apmex, and JD Bullion could see the unprecedented demand targeting physical silver.

“In the last week, we have seen a dramatic shift in Silver demand from our customers,” said Ken Lewis CEO of the bullion dealer Apmex. “For example, the ratio of ounces sold per day was running about two times earlier in the week and closer to four times the average demand by the end of the week,” Lewis added.

The Apmex CEO further stressed:

Once markets closed on Friday, we saw demand hit as much as six times a typical business day and more than 12 times a normal weekend day. Combined with the extremely high demand levels, we are also seeing a surge in new customers. On Saturday alone, we added as many new customers as we usually add in a week.

Additionally, the hashtag “#silversqueeze” has been trending throughout the United States and a few other countries on Twitter during the last 48 hours. By the late afternoon on Sunday, spot silver and futures traded at $27 per Troy ounce, and by Monday morning spot silver traded 7.7% higher at $29.76. The commodity hopped above the $30 region, and silver prices per ounce exchanged hands at $30.35 an ounce. One ounce of .999 silver is hovering in the $29 price handle at the time of publication

CHAPTER ONE: Listening to the Past

“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.” — Satoshi Nakamoto

The trusted third party problem has haunted modern financial systems and centralized exchanges because people require an intermediary to make them work. The third party’s good or bad motives become a defining aspect of the transaction, and the those who use the institutions are at the mercy of those intentions. This is especially true of the current system of state-issued money and central banking.

A trustless system avoids intermediaries and does not depend upon the intentions of participants; that is, the system functions in the same manner regardless of anyone’s intentions. The blockchain, with a transparent and immutable peer-to peer protocol, is called trustless because there is no corruptible intermediary upon whom exchanges must depend.

On a small scale, the trusted third party problem may always exist because a middleman is useful or necessary in some situations. If third parties offer competitive services on a free market, however, the damage of dishonesty or incompetence is limited. People can take their business elsewhere, report a swindler to watchdogs, warn others, and file a lawsuit.

An occasionally dishonest third party is not the problem Satoshi addresses. He speaks to the institutionalized corruption of government and central banks from which the average person could not escape by using a competitor or by suing. Almost everyone who works over the table, runs a business, buys or sells goods, accepts government benefits or pays taxes has had to accept a fiat that constantly plunges in value due to inflation. Almost everyone who uses credit, accepts checks, takes out loans, conducts commerce or does business abroad has needed to go through banks that steal like drunken muggers.

For average people, the situation used to seem hopeless because no legal, practical, and private alternative existed for transferring funds across considerable distance, including borders. Attempts to reform or remove the system also seemed doomed because it was inherently corrupt and self-serving. In fact, fiat and central banking were serving the purpose for which they had been established: financial control by elites. People’s need for money and exchange became their straitjackets.

Then Satoshi. Then the blockchain and crypto. A new concept of money was created in a form that cannot not be inflated; the number of bitcoins is fixed at 21 million divisible units. The supply can only decrease when coins are lost, as inevitably happens. Satoshi notes, “Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.” Bitcoin solved the fiat problem.

A new concept of financial transfer solved the third party problem, especially with regard to banks. Although peer-to-peer transactions involve a middleman or miner, no trust is required since the transaction is released only when “proof of work” is rendered, which consists of solving a complicated math problem. Arriving at a solution may be costly in computer power and time, but the solutions themselves are easy to verify. Satoshi comments, “With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.” The soundness and propriety of the blockchain’s protocol itself is assured by the use of open source that is visible to all and verifiable. The political outcome: A private currency and method of exchange freed people from financial oppression.

The idea of private currency itself is hardly new, however.

Precedent in Radical Individualist Theory

The late Friedrich Hayek is the most respected Austrian economist of the 20th century. His book The Denationalisation of Money: An Analysis of the Theory and Practice of Concurrent Currencies argues vigorously for private and competitive currencies to displace government-issued ones. Hayek ponders a key question. “When one studies the history of money one cannot help wondering why people should have put up for so long with governments exercising an exclusive power over two thousand years that was regularly used to exploit and defraud them. This can be explained only by the myth” that government money was necessary “becoming so firmly established that it did not occur even to the professional students of these matters…ever to question it. But once the validity of the established doctrine is doubted its foundation is rapidly seen to be fragile.”

Governments reap incredible profits from debasing the currency, but the rigged game works only if people have no alternative but to play it. The political purpose of legal tender and banking laws is to grant a monopoly to the state, which permits the redistribution of wealth and power from average people upward to the elite of society. Fiat money and banking remains fragile, however, because the system relies on people either not understanding the dynamics or not having a choice. Hayek wonders why public understanding is so elusive. Why was “a government monopoly of the provision of money…universally regarded as indispensable” and what would happen “if the provision of money were thrown open to the competition of private concerns supplying different currencies?”

With eerie prescience, Hayek argues for currencies developed by entrepreneurs who innovate new forms of money just as they innovate in other areas. One of the drawbacks of government’s monopoly is that it imposes a freeze on the sort of invention that now runs free in crypto. The voluntaryist historian Carl Watner observes, “No one can tell in advance what form these monies might take because no one can know for sure what choices individuals would make or what new technologies might be discovered. Laws forcing people to use the Federal Reserve System money have frozen monetary developments at a certain stage…Just imagine if Congress had protected the Post Office by passing laws that would have prevented people from communicating via the internet. We would never have experienced the marvels of e-mail.”

The late Austrian economist Murray Rothbard also wrestles with the question of “why do people so vigorously resist private currencies?” His book For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto advances an explanation. “If the government and only the government had had a monopoly of the shoe manufacturing and retailing business, how would most of the public treat the libertarian who now came along to advocate that the government get out of the shoe business and throw it open to private enterprise?” Rothbard predicts that the skeptics would attack the libertarian for depriving them of the only possible source of shoes—the government. People are thoroughly indoctrinated to believe that daily life cannot function without the state and fiat.

Hayek and Rothbard are unusual among free-market economists in their embrace of private money and monetary systems. Even laissez-faire zealots rarely champion free-market currencies or private banking. Instead, they debate marginal issues such as fractional reserve and other reforms they think will improve the existing system. Or they argue for the restoration of a gold standard as though it were a panacea. But if a gold standard were applied to fiat, the system would still require people to trust the government and banks. This means trusting both institutions to act against their own interests, which they have historically neglected to do.

The modern neglect of free-market money and banking is odd because 19th century radical individualists focused intensely on the importance of private money and private banking to personal freedom. They placed a primal emphasis on the right of every individual to create his own currency and to function as his own bank. It was a natural right as important as freedom of speech or of religion. The pivotal individualist Benjamin Tucker believed that the right to issue private currency was so important that it could destroy the State all by itself. His reasoning: The money monopoly, including control of credit, was how the State sustained itself and robbed average people not merely of wealth but also of economic opportunity.

Two specific events sculpted the approach that the early individualist-anarchists adopted toward the monetary monopoly. One was the Panic of 1837 that tipped the United States into recession until the mid-1840s. Commonly cited causes of the Panic include a collapsing land bubble and a sharp fall in cotton prices. Blame is also placed at the feet of President Andrew Jackson for vetoing the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States and precipitating an unfortunate chain of economic events. Drawing on the work of Professor of Economics Peter Temin, Rothbard disputes this interpretation.

First, he [Temin] points out that the price inflation really began earlier, when wholesale prices reached a trough of 82 in July 1830 and then rose by 20.7 percent in three years to reach 99 in the fall of 1833. The reason for the price rise is simple: The total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $159 million in 1833, an increase of 45.9 percent, or an annual rise of 15.3 percent. Breaking the figures down further, the total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $155 million a year and a half later, a spectacular expansion of 35 percent. Unquestionably, this monetary expansion was spurred by the still-flourishing Bank of the United States, which increased its notes and deposits from January 1830 to January 1832 from a total of $29 million to $42.1 million, a rise of 45.2 percent. Thus, the price and money inflation in the first few years of the 1830s were again sparked by the expansion of the still-dominant central bank.

Arguably, the Panic began in May 1837 when banks in New York City announced they would not redeem commercial paper for specie at full face value. Of the approximately 800 banks in America, all but six ceased at one point or another to redeem banknotes and deposits for gold or silver coins. Suspicion and hatred of traditional banks and government-issued money soared, with radicals scrutinizing alternate systems.

The other event dramatically to impact the radical fever from monetary reform was the Civil War for which the North financed its fighting through Legal Tender Acts and the National Banking Act of 1863.

The radicals did not merely theorize; they experimented with private currencies and new economic models. Their efforts are fascinating, but they are also cautionary tales. A major problem for 19th-century individualist-anarchism was the movement’s general acceptance of a link between sound money and the labor theory of value. This theory states that the true value of a good or service is based on the labor required to produce it rather than the price at which a seller and buyer are willing to exchange. In short, a good has intrinsic and not subjective value. (More on this in the section on the Regression Theorem.) Happily, their main economic goal was the abolition of the “money monopoly.” The term referred to three different but interacting forms of monopoly: banking, the charging of interest, and the privileged issuance of currency. The abolition of state power over currency was the focus, and they eschewed the use of force to implement their own schemes.

Josiah Warren provided a real-world example of what was meant by a currency that rested on the labor theory of value. Credited with being the first American anarchist, Warren tested his specific solution to the money monopoly through a Time Store from which he issued “Labor Notes.” In 1827, the business opened with $300 worth of groceries and dry goods that were offered at a 7 percent markup from Warren’s own costs in order to cover expenses such as overhead. This was before groceries were prepackaged or preweighed, and it was usual for buyers to bargain with the shopkeeper rather than pay a posted price. One of

Warren’s innovations was to post prices, which drove costs lower because transactions consumed less time. The customer paid in traditional money for the goods and paid with a Labor Note to compensate Warren for his time. The Labor Note obliged the customer to provide Warren with an equivalent amount of his time. If the buyer was a seamstress, for example, the Labor Note committed her to render to Warren X units of time to produce clothing. Warren’s goal was to establish an economy—or to establish a proof of principle, at least—in which profit was based on the exchange of time and labor. The Labor Notes were circulated and traded widely with in the community.

To some degree, Warren succeeded. People traveled from a hundred miles away to avail themselves of the Time Store’s low prices. After a few years, he declared the experiment to be a success and closed the store. Whether the Labor Notes were a success is questionable, however. The store itself may well have succeeded due to its low prices, not to the Notes. Whichever explanation is true, it is difficult to see how this novel currency could function in dense populations or on a grander scale of commerce. Few people today would be convinced of the viability of private money based on the Time Store experiment.

What could convince the public and economists that private currencies work as well or better than government-issued ones? Going back a bit further in American history is a good place to start because the future is always based on the past.

21Shares AG, a Zurich-based investment provider, is launching what is being dubbed as the world’s first Polkadot exchange-traded product, or ETP.

The DOT ETP will be listed on the Swiss exchange SIX on Thursday, February 4, said the company in a statement on Tuesday. DOT is the native token of the Polkadot network.

DOT has since been added to 21Shares’ Crypto Basket ETP (HODL), which tracks five major assets including bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH). Since its addition on Jan. 29, DOT now accounts for 27% of the product behind BTC at 50%.

Hany Rashwan, chief executive officer of 21Shares, said the firm has seen “unprecedented demand” from institutional investors wanting exposure to crypto-assets. He stated that demand for its range of crypto ETPs has soared 500% since the third quarter of 2020, but there has been “a recent surge in interest” for DOT.

“After investors purchase their first bitcoins through our ETPs, there is a natural transition to invest in other crypto assets,” Rashwan detailed.

“We benefit from trusted partners for the liquidity provision and upon continued institutional demand, we are launching the DOT ETP to give investors a safe, regulated, and easy way to obtain exposure to this exciting new blockchain technology,” he added.

Rashwan revealed that 21Shares, an issuer of exchange-traded products, is planning to add up to three ETPs over the next 3 months. He said European investors have been approaching the company to launch new products.

Created by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Polkadot is a cross-blockchain that enables transfers of any type of data or asset, not just tokens. It is also used as an electronic payment system.

DOT is now the world’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market capitalization of $16.55 billion, according to data from markets.Bitcoin.com. At the time of writing, DOT is trading at $17.22, up 8% over the past 24 hours.

Ukraine’s government-owned nuclear power plant picked a firm to build a massive data center in Rivne for cryptocurrency mining operations. After a bidding process, Energoatom chose Kyiv Energy Construction Company to handle the nuclear plant crypto mining project.

Nuclear Power Plant Operator Expects to Launch the Data Center in 2022

According to official documents, the data center will be based in the Rivne nuclear power plant, after the construction firm got 8.92 million Hryvnia ($317,620) in funding. The only competitor in the bidding was Ukrenergobudproek. However, they allegedly made an expensive offer, said the regional news outlet Forklog.

The Kyiv Energy Construction Company expects to finish the data center building by August 31, 2022. Per the announcement, the contractor is required to send the documentation that details the whole process. It includes “host state registers, electronic archives, and computing facilities.”

In terms of technical details, the nuclear power plant has a capacity of 2,657 megawatts, and it was built in the late 1970s. Also, the operations of the state-owned nuclear facilities started at the beginning of 1980.

In October 2020, Energoatom also signed a memorandum with a subsidiary of crypto mining giant Bitfury. With the new data center, local media outlets believe Bitfury miners could move their operations into the power plant’s facilities.

Ukraine’s Interest Towards Building Crypto Mining Data Centers in Nuclear Plants

The deal between Energoatom and Kyiv Energy Construction Company is not a surprising move. In fact, the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine asked Energoatom in May 2020 to conduct research to assess crypto mining’s feasibility at their nuclear plants.

As an anecdotal fact in terms of crypto mining in Ukrainian nuclear plants, the nation’s Security Service found illegal crypto mining equipment in a nuclear power plant in 2019.

The installation’s illegal mining rigs were found in the Southern region of Ukraine. Moreover, the investigations determined that such illegal equipment breached a “state secret.”

Global music distribution service Ditto has unveiled the latest addition to its service lineup for musicians with a blockchain-based financing platform named Opulous.

Opulous Peer-to-Peer Lending Platform Serves as a Loan Pool Designed to Help Artists

Ditto continues its efforts to improve the value chain for artists. Unlike other decentralized finance (defi) protocols, Opulous reflects asset-based lending, which bridges the physical and digital worlds. The Opulous’ defi lending mechanism, which is being developed on the Algorand public blockchain, leverages music copyrights’ tangibility through a smart contract setup that automatically handles principal and interest payments along with distributions to investors.

For musicians already receiving royalties, this presents a unique opportunity to monetize their assets or contribute to the pool to stake other artists. When seeking capital, artists can access funds by collateralizing loans from Opulous’ Music Copyright Pools with their music royalties.

Besides digitizing music as an asset class, the move will invite more democratized participation from artists and investors seeking to gain a foothold in the music industry, which is undergoing tremendous annual growth and expected to double in size by 2030. Artists benefit from interest rates starting as low as 4%, while investors in the copyright pools can add exposure to music royalties as an asset class for 10% returns per annum.

Per Ditto CEO Lee Parsons,

Opulous cuts out traditional banking, providing musicians with a platform with minimal interest payments, while giving investors the chance to stake a claim in one of the most exciting and fastest-growing financial industries in the world.

Ditto, which has already processed more than $1 billion in royalties for its 250,000-plus users, sees industry revenues doubling in the next ten years, building a compelling investment thesis. In keeping with Opulous’ mission to democratize musicians’ financial access, users outside the Ditto ecosystem are welcome to join the peer-to-peer lending framework.

Opulous has raised $1.5 million in funding to-date from BASIC, Borderless Capital, Kosmos Capital, Somesing, and TrustVerse. Roll out of the platform’s minimum viable product (MVP) is anticipated in two months as development proceeds.

Elastos, which built its decentralized application (dapp) platform and currency (ELA) to protect users’ digital assets and creations, will be among the first token staking partners for Opulous’ proof-of-stake consensus protocol. Opulous, in concert with Elastos, will allow investors to stake their Elastos (ELA) coins within the Music Copyright Pools.

According to Clarence Liu, the VP of Development at the Elastos Foundation,

Elastos and Ditto Music have been researching how blockchain can address fundamental inefficiencies in the music industry. Access to funding – which Opulous will address – is only the tip of the iceberg.

“Our collaboration has much more in the pipeline and our community is definitely set on using the forward momentum sparked by recent world events to introduce new users to the decentralized internet ideals set by Elastos,” Liu concludes.

During the last year, Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem has grown exponentially to form a multi Billion Dollar market. As Decentralized Finance expands, it becomes more and more relevant to have cross-chain connections that enable crypto assets to flow instantly and seamlessly across blockchain networks. These make it possible for DeFi platforms to be an effective alternative to centralized exchanges. Today, pNetwork launches the first EOS to Ethereum cross-chain connection to enable the EOS crypto asset to be moved into Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem.

EOS on Ethereum

EOS, the native token on the EOS blockchain, is a top20 cryptocurrency by market cap and the engine powering one of the most active dApps ecosystems. The asset counts over $ 3.5 Billion in daily trading volumes, figuring as the 9th most traded cryptocurrency. At present, only a fraction of the total is happening in a decentralized fashion.

While the DeFi ecosystem on EOS continues to grow, it has not yet reached Ethereum’s size. The latter powers Billions in daily trading volumes, Uniswap being the largestlarges liquidity protocol in existence and the fourth biggest DeFi protocol in terms of Total Value Locked.

Following the delivery of 26 bridges connecting six different blockchain protocols, including the cross-chain transfer of popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin, pNetwork launches today a new cross-chain connection that brings EOS to Ethereum.

As the first tokenised version of EOS, pEOS makes the asset compatible with Ethereum’s DeFi. This creates a benefit on both sides, enabling Ethereum’s DeFi protocols to expand their range of assets supported and granting EOS the option to be traded in a decentralized fashion as well as being supported as a collateral type by major Ethereum-based landing platforms.

Cross-chain connections are critical for a variety of use-cases, from NFTs to market making to decentralized indexes such as PieDAO’s Pies. pNetwork-powered asset tokenisation on Ethereum enables such indexes to represent the entire crypto market.

All pTokenised assets are pegged 1:1 to their underlying asset and are available for automated minting or redeeming on the pTokens dApp. In addition, pTokens are supported on a variety of DeFi protocols, decentralized exchanges and wallets on a growing number of blockchains.

Making Ethereum and EOS dApps Interoperable

Ethereum and EOS are two of the most active ecosystems for dApps, counting thousands of users each. By connecting these two blockchain environments, pNetwork aims to support the growth and development of decentralized applications such as lending/borrowing, trading, derivatives, and more. Acting as a cross-chain highway for cryptocurrencies to frictionlessly move from one blockchain to another, pNetwork powers the first bi-directional connection between the Ethereum and EOS blockchains.

Users on either blockchain are now able to interact with both ecosystems without ever leaving their blockchain of choice. Projects from both Ethereum and EOS communities have developed building blocks to create the next-generation financial system – with the connection between these two, users will find an even more powerful DeFi ecosystem.

By leveraging pNetwork’s cross-chain solution, dApps on the two blockchain platforms now have the opportunity to interoperate. Each ecosystem leveraging its counterpart’s strengths ultimately creates a benefit on both sides and sets the basis for sustainable growth. The presence of an EOS/ETH decentralized trading pair both with Ethereum’s and EOS’s decentralized finance, for example, makes it possible for market makers to arbitrage between the two blockchains. This results in a more liquid decentralized market for both assets.

As the so-called ‘meme coin’ is actively making the headlines within the crypto sphere, a publicly-traded company is joining the dogecoin frenzy. Kronos Advanced Technology announced they’ll start accepting dogecoin as one of its payment methods.

Kronos Also Accepts Other Cryptocurrencies Such as Bitcoin and Ether

According to the announcement, the Los Angeles-based firm is adding dogecoin (DOGE) to its accepted payment form. In fact, customers will be able to purchase air purifiers, and personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies via the meme coin.

Adopting dogecoin as a payment method was not as part as just of a crypto adoption-driven maneuver. The company praised the popularity of the token and its uniqueness within the industry.

Also, Kronos pointed out that dogecoins transactions’ speed is a positive note for the Shiba Inu inspired meme token. So far, the company accepts several cryptos as payment methods, such as bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), litecoin (LTC), among others.

Expanding N95 Mask Market Into the Dogecoin Community

Michael Rubinov, president of Kronos Advanced Technologies, commented on the company’s stance towards cryptocurrencies:

In the last ten years, much has been said about how cryptocurrency will revolutionize payments, services, businesses and will change the world the way we know it. Cryptocurrency has changed e-commerce: as more and more people now shop online. Cryptocurrency gives customers more reasons to utilize the convenience of online shopping, as it mitigates the risk of fraud for both vendors and shoppers.

By adopting dogecoin as a form of payment, Kronos also expect to market N95 masks to the entire meme coin community on Reddit, which has grown over 670,000 members. The company also praised the fact that Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk endorses dogecoin as one of his favorite cryptocurrencies.

Despite the recent frenzy seen in the meme coin, the latest markets.Bitcoin.com data shows that dogecoin is exchanging hands at $0.0317, down -20.43% on Tuesday. The market capitalization still stands at $4.08 billion.

Spacex and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been trying to get to the bottom of what happened with the popular trading app Robinhood when it stopped people from buying shares of hot stocks, like Gamestop. The shares of these stocks became popular due to the Wallstreetbets movement.

Elon Musk Says People Want the Truth From Robinhood

During an interview on The Good Time Show via the Clubhouse app Sunday night, Elon Musk grilled the CEO of trading app Robinhood, Vlad Tenev, over the company’s decision to restrict hot stocks last week, including Gamestop. On Friday, Robinhood also restricted crypto trading, citing “extraordinary market conditions.”

“What happened last week? Why can’t people buy the Gamestop shares? The people demand an answer and they want to know the details and the truth,” Musk said.

Tenev began by explaining the structure of his company. “Robinhood is actually a couple of companies,” he described. Robinhood Financial processes trades, Robinhood Securities clears and settles the trades, and Robinhood Crypto which deals with crypto trades.

The Robinhood CEO detailed that last Wednesday, his platform experienced “unprecedented volume” as “a lot of these so-called meme stocks were going viral on social media and people were joining Robinhood” to buy these stocks. Consequently, the company “received a file” from the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) Thursday morning at about 3:30 AM PST. It requested Robinhood to “put up money to the NSCC based on some factors,” including the volatility of certain securities. Tenev clarified that “this is the equities business so it’s based on stock trading and not options trading or anything else,” elaborating:

They gave us a file with a deposit and the request was around $3 billion dollars which is about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is.

Musk interrupted Tenev, questioning: “Why is that so high? It sounds like this is an unprecedented increase in demand for capital. What formula did they use to calculate that?”

Tenev replied: “We don’t have the full details. It’s a little bit of an opaque formula but there’s a component called the VAR of it, which is the Value at Risk, and that’s based on kind of some fairly quantitative things … and then there’s a special component which is discretionary so that kind of acts as a multiplier.” Tenev also noted that up until that point, his company “has raised a little bit around two billion dollars in total venture capital,” so the request was “a big number.”

The Tesla CEO interrupted again, asking: “What everyone wants to know is did something maybe shady go down here? It seems weird that you’d get a sudden $10 billion demand in the morning … suddenly out of nowhere.” Tenev swiftly corrected Musk that the number was $3 billion. The Robinhood CEO then emphasized:

I wouldn’t impugn shadiness to it or anything like that, and actually the NSCC was reasonable subsequent to this. They worked with us to actually lower it. It was unprecedented activity.

Musk abruptly asked Tenev: “Is there anyone holding you hostage right now?” Tenev chuckled and replied: “No, no, I’m okay. Thanks for asking.” Both laughed.

The Robinhood CEO proceeded to explain what happened, calling the experience “nerve-wrecking.” He said after receiving the request for $3 billion, his chief operating officer called up someone higher up at the NSCC to discuss what to do. “There was another call and they lowered it to something like $1.4 billion from $3 billion,” Tenev reiterated that it was still a high number. His company then proposed a plan to the NSCC of “marking these volatile stocks that were kind of driving the activity position-closing only.”

Then, at about 5 to 5:30 AM PST, before the market opened, the NSCC came back and reduced the deposit requirement to $700 million, “which we then deposited and paid promptly,” Tenev emphasized. Acknowledging that the move was bad for customers, the Robinhood CEO said, “We had no choice, in this case. We had to conform to our regulatory capital requirements and so the team did what they could to make sure we were available for customers.”

The Spacex CEO further questioned: “Who controls this organization, this clearinghouse?” Tenev replied: “It’s a consortium. It’s not quite a government agency. I don’t really know the details of all of that.” Nonetheless, he emphasized that “To be fair … I think there was legitimate sort of turmoil in the markets … so there probably is some amount of extra risk in the system that warrants higher requirements so it’s not entirely unreasonable.” He noted that lots of other brokers were in the same situation and had to restrict the same activity.

“So it sounds like this organization calls you up and they basically have a gun to your head: either hand over this money or else,” the Spacex CEO summarized, elaborating:

Basically, what people are wondering is did you sell your clients down the river or did you have no choice. If you had no choice, that’s understandable but then we got to find out why you had no choice and who are these people that are saying you have no choice.

“I think that’s fair. We have to comply with these requirements. Financial institutions have requirements,” Tenev responded. Nonetheless, he suggested that it would be helpful to know the formula the NSCC uses to calculate these requirements so companies can plan better.

Musk proceeded to ask about whether there was outside pressure forcing Robinhood to take the action it did. Tenev affirmed that there is “a rumor that Citadel or other market makers kind of pressured us into doing this.” However, he clarified, “that’s just false,” emphasizing that “this was a clearinghouse decision and it was just based on the capital requirements so from our perspective Citadel and other market makers weren’t involved in that.”

During the same Clubhouse interview, Elon also revealed that he is a supporter of bitcoin and should have bought the cryptocurrency eight years ago. He believes that bitcoin is on the verge of getting broad acceptance by traditional finance people. On Monday, Robinhood raised another $2.4 billion from shareholders after it secured $1 billion last Thursday.

PRESS RELEASE. The AdGram service was founded a year ago and is currently the largest advertising exchange in Telegram.

AdGram helps brands place large advertising volumes in channels and groups quickly and efficiently. Channels and groups benefit from expansion of their audience, it is easy to find advertisers and increase the earnings from advertising placements via AdGram.

Over the last 12 months, the service has gained a huge experience in communications with both advertisers and administrators from different countries, which has highlighted issues with settlements in multiple currencies. After overcoming these obstacles, it was decided that cryptocurrency could be the key to solving this problem.

With the termination of the Telegram team’s work on the TON project in May 2020 (the messenger lost one of its monetization methods), Free TON was launched which took over the development and popularization of TON Crystal using the open source code from the original TON. The uniqueness of FreeTON is that it is one of the few projects where all the tokens belong to the community and it is developing as a decentralized autonomous organization.

The potential of the underlying technology and the growth of the community inspired AdGram and in October 2020 they partnered with the FreeTON Community and fully integrated Crystal as a means of payment. Synergy with FreeTON made it possible to take a big step towards using cryptocurrencies as a single, simple and clear means of payment.

The ability to pay with tokens for advertising in Telegram creates a powerful use case for the TON Crystal token. Huge and constantly growing volume of the advertising market is vital for tokenomics as it creates supply and demand for market participants, thereby increasing the liquidity of the token itself.

For administrators and advertisers transactions in TON Crystal is simple, convenient and fast! It also solves the problem of collecting details for transfers in various currencies, and avoids paying banking fees.

Advertising on Telegram and the FreeTON blockchain, which is the successor of Durov’s original (but never happened Durov’s TON), create a strong and impact-resistant synergy of mutual benefits. This shows markets and communities can develop in a self-regulated environment.

PRESS RELEASE. CEX.IO LOAN experiences massive institutional demand for its crypto-backed lending service, with 41% of customers requesting to borrow cash against Bitcoin, 53% against Ethereum, and 6% against DeFi tokens.

Crypto-backed lending service CEX.IO LOAN that launched in October 2020 in select global jurisdictions, has been experiencing major demand, receiving over $100 million worth of loan requests to date. While the service has been widely popular among retail investors, most of the platform’s loan requests came from institutional investors.

According to CEX.IO LOAN, such an increase in demand can be attributed to the institutionalization of the cryptocurrency industry. Institutional investors, who have cryptocurrencies in their possession, regard it as a potential collateral for borrowing funds and actively utilise it as such. The borrowed funds are then used for further investment purposes.

In addition to featuring cutting-edge security and advanced anti-fraud measures, CEX.IO Group operates a regulated service, which has been licensed as a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) provider by the Gibraltar Financial Service Commission (GFSC) since last year. In addition to this, the Government of Gibraltar recently granted CEX.IO Limited a Money Lender License, allowing the firm to extend its ecosystem of regulated services with CEX.IO LOAN.

Institutional clients also prefer the company’s digital asset-backed lending service due to the convenience offered to users. On the CEX.IO LOAN platform, customers can borrow cash against their cryptocurrency assets in a quick and simple manner, without having to deal with credit checks or any unnecessary paperwork. To access the company’s instant crypto-backed lending service, new users have to open an account at the digital asset exchange and pass the mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML checks.

CEX.IO LOAN serves various cryptocurrency market participants, from retail investors, traders, and HODLers to startups, entrepreneurs, and large enterprises. As part of a flexible crypto-backed lending service, users can borrow any amount between $500 and $100,000 at competitive interest rates starting at 8.75% per year. Loan duration ranging from seven days to one year.

Currently, retail users can borrow funds against their Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) assets. Based on the company’s data, the feature has already experienced high demand from VIP clients, with 41% of all CEX.IO LOAN customers borrowing cash against Bitcoin (BTC), 53% against Ethereum (ETH), and 6% against DeFi tokens.

The company has recently introduced a VIP-exclusive feature to offer flexible lending conditions and the ability to use decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens as collateral for institutional clients on the crypto-backed lending platform.

Furthermore, to best serve institutional customers, the requests and queries of VIP clients are handled individually by dedicated personal managers on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Interestingly, 14% of CEX.IO VIP customers have already asked their personal managers about borrowing funds via the crypto-backed lending service.

“As institutional investors find the digital asset industry increasingly attractive, it’s a pleasure to serve them with our enterprise-grade instant crypto-backed loan platform. Security, convenience, and compliance are key priorities for corporate clients, which are features that we have been providing to all our clients in the rapidly growing CEX.IO ecosystem. Most importantly, we want to provide institutional clients with the best service. For that reason, VIP clients enjoy exclusive benefits, such as dedicated personal managers and flexible lending options, on the CEX.IO LOAN platform,” Anton Chashchin, Commercial Director for the CEX.IO LOAN service, stated.

In the announcement, the firm revealed further details about the size of the funds clients borrow on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Based on the company’s data, while retail investors borrow $1,400 on average, VIP clients request larger-sized loans that vary in size, with the typical amount being $1 million or higher.

Institutional clients do not just borrow more but also need the funds for more extended periods which usually range between 6 and 12 months. According to the company, this phenomenon indicates a long-term strategy for VIP clients to manage their assets.

PRESS RELEASE. PARSIQ, a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform connecting on-chain and off-chain applications in real-time, announced that its PRQ token is now listed on OKEx with USDT base pair.

Please take note of the following go-live schedule:

PRQ Deposit : 07:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Spot Trading : PRQ / USDT : 10:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Withdrawal : 10:00 January 29, 2021 (UTC)

PARSIQ is a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform that serves as a multi-level bridge between blockchains and off-chain applications. PARSIQ’s features automate the blockchain analytics and monitoring process, providing customizable workflows with real-time intelligence.

Developers and individual users can transform the blockchain data to their favorite off-chain application or web service.

Among the obvious use cases is monitoring the wallets of traders and ordinary users. Among the non-obvious are complex system integrations for financial institutions and DeFi projects that use the PARSIQ infrastructure to improve security, conduct audits, comply with regulatory requirements, AML, and expand their workflows in other ways.

The infrastructure underneath PARSIQ’s user interface is built with their proprietary programming language ParsiQL, and its users’ benefits are multiplying with each supported integration.

PRQ Token

PARSIQ Token (PRQ) is an essential piece of the PARSIQ platform that co-exists with FIAT payments for using its services. Payments within the platform that are made in PRQ tokens guarantee a discounted rate. During the first Epoch when PRQ tokens are used as payment for running Smart-Triggers users receive higher execution limits, unlock transport methods, and are able to propose features that can be added to the platform.

In October 2020, the PARSIQ team released plans for Epoch 2.0.

#1. Public Projects

With Public Projects users can subscribe to existing PARSIQ Projects that were pre-made by other users. By paying in PRQ, users that have subscribed to the Public Project will incentivize the creators to create interesting, complex, and more important – problem-solving projects.

#2. User Data and PRQ

Every single monitoring target (primitive of type address, a struct with the field of address type, table row) would require 1 PRQ to hold after the implementation. It means that if there are 1000 addresses (960 in the table as rows, 30 as primitives, 10 in the structs) then the User would need 1000 PRQ on the connected Ethereum Account balance.

#3. IQ Protocol

IQ Protocol will allow risk-free PRQ lending and collateral-less borrowing. Risk-free PRQ lending means that PRQ is not transferred from the lender’s address to the borrower’s address. Details on the algorithm are available in the dedicated explainer on PARSIQ’s blog.

#4. PRQBoost

PRQ Boost is a liquidity boost program to incentivize PRQ/ETH liquidity providers on Uniswap, which goes with the PRQBOOST utility tokens to increase rewards for liquidity providers.

PARSIQ is actively working to partner with major layer 1 blockchain protocols to expand the range of blockchain integrations and give projects that build on those protocols the ability to monitor and automate workflows between blockchain and off-chain.

PRESS RELEASE. YFX, the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts has just launched, adding an important piece to the DeFi money legos, and creating a direct competition against CEX on derivatives trading.

The most traded Bitcoin product in centralized exchanges is Bitcoin futures, which is 10 times bigger than spot trading in terms of the trading volume. But in DEX, spot trading platforms like Uniswap are occupying a large portion of the total trading volume, and there is not a single decentralized futures trading platform that could reach even 1/10 of Uniswap’s trading volume. What stops decentralized futures trading platforms from becoming 10 times bigger than Uniswap? Why are decentralized futures trading platforms performing worse than their centralized counterparts?

The main reason is that decentralized futures exchanges don’t currently provide an attractive futures product to compete with centralized futures exchanges. For instance, centralized futures exchanges like BitMex can provide 100x leverage on Bitcoin futures trading. On the other hand, decentralized futures exchanges like dYdX only offer 10x leverage. None of the decentralized exchanges can keep up with the 100x leverage offering from centralized exchanges.

YFX Descartes V1 uses QIC-AMM and a system de-risk mechanism to migrate perpetual futures trading from CEX to DEX without reducing the trading leverage, which makes YFX the first DEX that could offer 100x leverage on a perpetual contract. You can do everything on YFX that you can do on BitMex or OKEx. YFX is poised to compete directly against established centralized exchanges. YFX Descartes V1 runs on the TRON MainNet, for faster transaction times and cheaper gas fees compared to Ethereum. The YFX team is also working on Ethereum’s Layer 2 solution to provide pragmatic perpetual trading on DEX. YFX team plans to launch their DEX on Huobi Heco and Ethereum Test net in Q1, 2021.

About YFX

YFX is the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts. YFX Descartes V1 launched on the TRON MainNet, and all trades are held and processed by smart contracts. The main goal of the YFX team, which is formed by a group of engineers who have years of experience working on trading systems and blockchain, is to build a DEX that can compete with CEX on derivative trading.

The Wall Street Bets saga, an incredibly ridiculous story about a group of amateur Reddit investors who beat career Wall Street hedge funds at their own game, is to be made into a movie.

According to a report by online news site Deadline on Jan. 31, Metro Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) won the rights to produce the film in a bidding war involving major Hollywood movie houses.

The movie is to be based on a book proposed by author Ben Mezrich. Mezrich’s previous work, “The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding Of Facebook, a Tale Of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal,” was adapted into the motion picture “The Social Network.”

The title to his planned latest book offering is called “The Antisocial Network,” said the report, quoting sources familiar with the development. The book is expected to go out to publishers later this February, it said.

However, it is not yet clear what shape or structure the movie will take. MGM’s Michael DeLuca will produce the film. DeLuca also produced the Academy-Award winning The Social Network. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss will executive produce via their Winklevoss Pictures production company.

The Wall Street Bets group noticed that major hedge funds on Wall Street had been placing short bets against companies they considered to be dying. The funds particularly targeted Gamestop, the world’s largest video game retailer, continually shorting the company’s shares.

But the Redditors saw an opportunity to make profit and collectively bet the other way, buying shares and stock options. This resulted in the value of the Gamestop shares soaring by more than 2,600% in January.

Hedge funds that had shorted the stock incurred losses running into several billions of dollars. One fund, Melvin Capital, reportedly lost up to $7 billion to the “short squeeze” in January, forcing it to restructure its investment portfolio to ensure a faster escape in future “squeezes.”

The Reddit traders also extended the pump to a few other stocks considered to be dying, including AMC (which climbed over 900% in January), as well as Nokia and Blackberry. This surge of activity resulted in a major controversy when the trading app Robinhood began restricting trade on certain stocks.

Alongside the cryptocurrency’s meteoric climb over the back half of 2020 and early 2021, a curious phenomenon has unfolded; heightened profit-taking and conversion to fiat currencies. Data collected by Simplex, a fiat-crypto gateway, underscores this seemingly paradoxical development.

A Curious Race to Convert Crypto to Fiat Has Accompanied Bitcoin’s Latest Drive Higher

Sharing exclusive data with Bitcoin.com, Simplex cofounder and chief analytics officer Netanel Kabala says:

While the international press coverage of Bitcoin’s rally has caused a swathe of new users to flock to the industry and buy-in, outflows have been equally significant. Of the total amount of cryptocurrency sold in the last six months, 43% was off ramped in December alone.

A quick look at Google Trends for the term ‘Bitcoin’ echoes these developments, especially now that new equity instruments like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and big-name funds like Blackrock are adding exposure and raising crypto awareness.

Still, given the increased ability to quickly convert crypto and withdraw in fiat currencies, the uptick in funds leaving the ecosystem is astonishing. Part of this can be attributed to the growing fungibility of cryptocurrency, primarily helped by the support of players like Simplex, which empowers users to buy, sell, and spend crypto through Visa partnerships.

Although some of the latest rally’s onlookers have decried the rapid rise in crypto valuations as proof that a bubble is forming in this nascent asset class, others within the industry see the development as a harbinger of times to come. One of the areas this is most apparent is altcoins.

Data compiled by Simplex illustrates that as Bitcoin prices have leveled off above $30,000, daily purchases of altcoins have risen by approximately 65%. More interestingly, the data highlights that newer users account for nearly 20% of this volume, marking a sharp increase in the number of novice retail investors expanding and diversifying their exposure within the ecosystem.

Poloniex, one of the top 20 global cryptocurrency exchanges, which has adopted Simplex’s platform, has experienced these results firsthand. Karen McHenry, Poloniex’s Director of Product, attributes this development to greater access within the ecosystem, especially with Simplex’s buy option, which promotes instant account funding alongside the heightened ability to cash out quickly.

She also doesn’t see the ability to more quickly convert from crypto to fiat as harming interest despite the eyepopping amounts taken off exchanges.

It may sound surprising, but adding the ‘sell’ option actually has a positive impact on the number of crypto transactions too.

Though this easy offramp and soaring volume of sell orders might seem negative for prices, it can also be viewed as a healthy reflection of the ecosystem’s growing use cases. Besides making it easier to exit and enter, growing areas like decentralized finance (defi) and greater fungibility all contribute to a cryptocurrency’s value proposition.

As institutions begin lining up to add exposure as retail accumulation climbs, Bitcoin momentum may actually accelerate, and by extension, lift the altcoins sought after by the newcomers seeking opportunities outside the seminal crypto coin.

McHenry adds:

If the bull market can maintain its momentum, some of these BTC profits will flow into altcoins, which are particularly popular among retail investors. This creates a positive feedback loop, with traders who turn a profit prone to telling their friends about crypto, which brings more investment into the space.

Do you think the offramping will continue throughout 2021? Let us know in the comments sections below.

This past week, another social media trend started on the Reddit forum r/wallstreetbets, which aims to initiate a large silver short squeeze in order to push the price of the precious metal to $1,000 per ounce. However, the silver squeeze trend comes with controversy, as numerous wallstreetbets supporters believe hedge funds like Melvin Capital and Citadel are behind the silver push.

The Controversial ‘Silver Squeeze’

During the last week, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the wallstreetbets (WSB) saga taking place on social media forums and the infamous subreddit r/wallstreetbets. Since the mega short squeeze on the Gamestop (GME) shares, the squeeze maneuver has also spilled into a number of other stocks. This week, shares from the Russell 3000 Index (RUA) were targeted including tickers like NOK, GOGO, AMCX, and FIZZ. But the trend didn’t stop there, as one post, in particular, had called for a “silver squeeze.” The WSB Reddit post called for the silver squeeze to push the price of silver from $25 per ounce to $1,000.

Now since the post was published, the Reddit admins in charge of moderating r/wallstreetbets removed the post. But that was long after the message was made viral by the participants discussing the pros and cons of attempting to squeeze silver. Now the reason people think the silver short squeeze post may be shady, is because a number of WSB Redditors believe the silver squeeze was invoked by the hedge funds losing money in order to cover their GME losses. There are a great number of Reddit posts warning that people should not participate in the silver short squeeze.

One post said:

Citadel is the 5th largest owner of [silver], it’s imperative we do not ‘squeeze’ it. These are hedge fund bots spamming awards.

The people who dislike the silver trend on WSB, have also warned that Melvin Capital Management is also a big silver holder. Unfortunately, it is hard to tell where the silver pump threads and posts are stemming from, as there are many free-market supporters who are fans of the precious metal sometimes referred to as the ‘poor man’s gold.’

Despite this, there are numbers of WSB fans and Redditors claiming the silver pump stemmed from hedge fund people and they believe there are imposters everywhere now. Some of these people are growing irrational, getting mad at anyone who posts about silver. Many WSB supporters might be feeling the pain from Gamestop Corp. shares dropping significantly on Monday.

In Spite of Controversy, Something Is Sparking Silver Demand

Despite the speculation, some sort of demand was invoked when it comes to silver prices and obtaining physical bullion. For instance, if you are attempting to purchase an ounce or ounces of silver bullion online, the process is far more complicated now than it was last week. A large portion of bars and coins are either sold out or the prices are marked up considerably.

This is simple arbitrage. #Silver futures are 28.67. Silver Eagles on Apmex are $41.66, thats a 45% premium to futures. Obvious opportunity to buy futures & stand for delivery for a 35% discount on physical right? But when they don't have it, Futures = $41.66/oz. #silversqueeze — Jonathan #SILVERSQUEEZE Mergott (@Jmergz1985) February 1, 2021

All the American Eagles are sold out across a number of bullion dealers. On Sunday morning, a few big-name dealers have halted a great number of silver sales. News.Bitcoin.com’s most recent WSB report disclosed how SD Bullion sold nearly 10x the number of silver ounces than usual. People visiting bullion dealer websites like Provident, Apmex, and JD Bullion could see the unprecedented demand targeting physical silver.

“In the last week, we have seen a dramatic shift in Silver demand from our customers,” said Ken Lewis CEO of the bullion dealer Apmex. “For example, the ratio of ounces sold per day was running about two times earlier in the week and closer to four times the average demand by the end of the week,” Lewis added.

The Apmex CEO further stressed:

Once markets closed on Friday, we saw demand hit as much as six times a typical business day and more than 12 times a normal weekend day. Combined with the extremely high demand levels, we are also seeing a surge in new customers. On Saturday alone, we added as many new customers as we usually add in a week.

Additionally, the hashtag “#silversqueeze” has been trending throughout the United States and a few other countries on Twitter during the last 48 hours. By the late afternoon on Sunday, spot silver and futures traded at $27 per Troy ounce, and by Monday morning spot silver traded 7.7% higher at $29.76. The commodity hopped above the $30 region, and silver prices per ounce exchanged hands at $30.35 an ounce. One ounce of .999 silver is hovering in the $29 price handle at the time of publication

CHAPTER ONE: Listening to the Past

“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.” — Satoshi Nakamoto

The trusted third party problem has haunted modern financial systems and centralized exchanges because people require an intermediary to make them work. The third party’s good or bad motives become a defining aspect of the transaction, and the those who use the institutions are at the mercy of those intentions. This is especially true of the current system of state-issued money and central banking.

A trustless system avoids intermediaries and does not depend upon the intentions of participants; that is, the system functions in the same manner regardless of anyone’s intentions. The blockchain, with a transparent and immutable peer-to peer protocol, is called trustless because there is no corruptible intermediary upon whom exchanges must depend.

On a small scale, the trusted third party problem may always exist because a middleman is useful or necessary in some situations. If third parties offer competitive services on a free market, however, the damage of dishonesty or incompetence is limited. People can take their business elsewhere, report a swindler to watchdogs, warn others, and file a lawsuit.

An occasionally dishonest third party is not the problem Satoshi addresses. He speaks to the institutionalized corruption of government and central banks from which the average person could not escape by using a competitor or by suing. Almost everyone who works over the table, runs a business, buys or sells goods, accepts government benefits or pays taxes has had to accept a fiat that constantly plunges in value due to inflation. Almost everyone who uses credit, accepts checks, takes out loans, conducts commerce or does business abroad has needed to go through banks that steal like drunken muggers.

For average people, the situation used to seem hopeless because no legal, practical, and private alternative existed for transferring funds across considerable distance, including borders. Attempts to reform or remove the system also seemed doomed because it was inherently corrupt and self-serving. In fact, fiat and central banking were serving the purpose for which they had been established: financial control by elites. People’s need for money and exchange became their straitjackets.

Then Satoshi. Then the blockchain and crypto. A new concept of money was created in a form that cannot not be inflated; the number of bitcoins is fixed at 21 million divisible units. The supply can only decrease when coins are lost, as inevitably happens. Satoshi notes, “Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.” Bitcoin solved the fiat problem.

A new concept of financial transfer solved the third party problem, especially with regard to banks. Although peer-to-peer transactions involve a middleman or miner, no trust is required since the transaction is released only when “proof of work” is rendered, which consists of solving a complicated math problem. Arriving at a solution may be costly in computer power and time, but the solutions themselves are easy to verify. Satoshi comments, “With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.” The soundness and propriety of the blockchain’s protocol itself is assured by the use of open source that is visible to all and verifiable. The political outcome: A private currency and method of exchange freed people from financial oppression.

The idea of private currency itself is hardly new, however.

Precedent in Radical Individualist Theory

The late Friedrich Hayek is the most respected Austrian economist of the 20th century. His book The Denationalisation of Money: An Analysis of the Theory and Practice of Concurrent Currencies argues vigorously for private and competitive currencies to displace government-issued ones. Hayek ponders a key question. “When one studies the history of money one cannot help wondering why people should have put up for so long with governments exercising an exclusive power over two thousand years that was regularly used to exploit and defraud them. This can be explained only by the myth” that government money was necessary “becoming so firmly established that it did not occur even to the professional students of these matters…ever to question it. But once the validity of the established doctrine is doubted its foundation is rapidly seen to be fragile.”

Governments reap incredible profits from debasing the currency, but the rigged game works only if people have no alternative but to play it. The political purpose of legal tender and banking laws is to grant a monopoly to the state, which permits the redistribution of wealth and power from average people upward to the elite of society. Fiat money and banking remains fragile, however, because the system relies on people either not understanding the dynamics or not having a choice. Hayek wonders why public understanding is so elusive. Why was “a government monopoly of the provision of money…universally regarded as indispensable” and what would happen “if the provision of money were thrown open to the competition of private concerns supplying different currencies?”

With eerie prescience, Hayek argues for currencies developed by entrepreneurs who innovate new forms of money just as they innovate in other areas. One of the drawbacks of government’s monopoly is that it imposes a freeze on the sort of invention that now runs free in crypto. The voluntaryist historian Carl Watner observes, “No one can tell in advance what form these monies might take because no one can know for sure what choices individuals would make or what new technologies might be discovered. Laws forcing people to use the Federal Reserve System money have frozen monetary developments at a certain stage…Just imagine if Congress had protected the Post Office by passing laws that would have prevented people from communicating via the internet. We would never have experienced the marvels of e-mail.”

The late Austrian economist Murray Rothbard also wrestles with the question of “why do people so vigorously resist private currencies?” His book For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto advances an explanation. “If the government and only the government had had a monopoly of the shoe manufacturing and retailing business, how would most of the public treat the libertarian who now came along to advocate that the government get out of the shoe business and throw it open to private enterprise?” Rothbard predicts that the skeptics would attack the libertarian for depriving them of the only possible source of shoes—the government. People are thoroughly indoctrinated to believe that daily life cannot function without the state and fiat.

Hayek and Rothbard are unusual among free-market economists in their embrace of private money and monetary systems. Even laissez-faire zealots rarely champion free-market currencies or private banking. Instead, they debate marginal issues such as fractional reserve and other reforms they think will improve the existing system. Or they argue for the restoration of a gold standard as though it were a panacea. But if a gold standard were applied to fiat, the system would still require people to trust the government and banks. This means trusting both institutions to act against their own interests, which they have historically neglected to do.

The modern neglect of free-market money and banking is odd because 19th century radical individualists focused intensely on the importance of private money and private banking to personal freedom. They placed a primal emphasis on the right of every individual to create his own currency and to function as his own bank. It was a natural right as important as freedom of speech or of religion. The pivotal individualist Benjamin Tucker believed that the right to issue private currency was so important that it could destroy the State all by itself. His reasoning: The money monopoly, including control of credit, was how the State sustained itself and robbed average people not merely of wealth but also of economic opportunity.

Two specific events sculpted the approach that the early individualist-anarchists adopted toward the monetary monopoly. One was the Panic of 1837 that tipped the United States into recession until the mid-1840s. Commonly cited causes of the Panic include a collapsing land bubble and a sharp fall in cotton prices. Blame is also placed at the feet of President Andrew Jackson for vetoing the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States and precipitating an unfortunate chain of economic events. Drawing on the work of Professor of Economics Peter Temin, Rothbard disputes this interpretation.

First, he [Temin] points out that the price inflation really began earlier, when wholesale prices reached a trough of 82 in July 1830 and then rose by 20.7 percent in three years to reach 99 in the fall of 1833. The reason for the price rise is simple: The total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $159 million in 1833, an increase of 45.9 percent, or an annual rise of 15.3 percent. Breaking the figures down further, the total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $155 million a year and a half later, a spectacular expansion of 35 percent. Unquestionably, this monetary expansion was spurred by the still-flourishing Bank of the United States, which increased its notes and deposits from January 1830 to January 1832 from a total of $29 million to $42.1 million, a rise of 45.2 percent. Thus, the price and money inflation in the first few years of the 1830s were again sparked by the expansion of the still-dominant central bank.

Arguably, the Panic began in May 1837 when banks in New York City announced they would not redeem commercial paper for specie at full face value. Of the approximately 800 banks in America, all but six ceased at one point or another to redeem banknotes and deposits for gold or silver coins. Suspicion and hatred of traditional banks and government-issued money soared, with radicals scrutinizing alternate systems.

The other event dramatically to impact the radical fever from monetary reform was the Civil War for which the North financed its fighting through Legal Tender Acts and the National Banking Act of 1863.

The radicals did not merely theorize; they experimented with private currencies and new economic models. Their efforts are fascinating, but they are also cautionary tales. A major problem for 19th-century individualist-anarchism was the movement’s general acceptance of a link between sound money and the labor theory of value. This theory states that the true value of a good or service is based on the labor required to produce it rather than the price at which a seller and buyer are willing to exchange. In short, a good has intrinsic and not subjective value. (More on this in the section on the Regression Theorem.) Happily, their main economic goal was the abolition of the “money monopoly.” The term referred to three different but interacting forms of monopoly: banking, the charging of interest, and the privileged issuance of currency. The abolition of state power over currency was the focus, and they eschewed the use of force to implement their own schemes.

Josiah Warren provided a real-world example of what was meant by a currency that rested on the labor theory of value. Credited with being the first American anarchist, Warren tested his specific solution to the money monopoly through a Time Store from which he issued “Labor Notes.” In 1827, the business opened with $300 worth of groceries and dry goods that were offered at a 7 percent markup from Warren’s own costs in order to cover expenses such as overhead. This was before groceries were prepackaged or preweighed, and it was usual for buyers to bargain with the shopkeeper rather than pay a posted price. One of

Warren’s innovations was to post prices, which drove costs lower because transactions consumed less time. The customer paid in traditional money for the goods and paid with a Labor Note to compensate Warren for his time. The Labor Note obliged the customer to provide Warren with an equivalent amount of his time. If the buyer was a seamstress, for example, the Labor Note committed her to render to Warren X units of time to produce clothing. Warren’s goal was to establish an economy—or to establish a proof of principle, at least—in which profit was based on the exchange of time and labor. The Labor Notes were circulated and traded widely with in the community.

To some degree, Warren succeeded. People traveled from a hundred miles away to avail themselves of the Time Store’s low prices. After a few years, he declared the experiment to be a success and closed the store. Whether the Labor Notes were a success is questionable, however. The store itself may well have succeeded due to its low prices, not to the Notes. Whichever explanation is true, it is difficult to see how this novel currency could function in dense populations or on a grander scale of commerce. Few people today would be convinced of the viability of private money based on the Time Store experiment.

What could convince the public and economists that private currencies work as well or better than government-issued ones? Going back a bit further in American history is a good place to start because the future is always based on the past.

The modern neglect of free-market money and banking is odd because 19th century radical individualists focused intensely on the importance of private money and private banking to personal freedom.

21Shares AG, a Zurich-based investment provider, is launching what is being dubbed as the world’s first Polkadot exchange-traded product, or ETP.

The DOT ETP will be listed on the Swiss exchange SIX on Thursday, February 4, said the company in a statement on Tuesday. DOT is the native token of the Polkadot network.

DOT has since been added to 21Shares’ Crypto Basket ETP (HODL), which tracks five major assets including bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH). Since its addition on Jan. 29, DOT now accounts for 27% of the product behind BTC at 50%.

Hany Rashwan, chief executive officer of 21Shares, said the firm has seen “unprecedented demand” from institutional investors wanting exposure to crypto-assets. He stated that demand for its range of crypto ETPs has soared 500% since the third quarter of 2020, but there has been “a recent surge in interest” for DOT.

“After investors purchase their first bitcoins through our ETPs, there is a natural transition to invest in other crypto assets,” Rashwan detailed.

“We benefit from trusted partners for the liquidity provision and upon continued institutional demand, we are launching the DOT ETP to give investors a safe, regulated, and easy way to obtain exposure to this exciting new blockchain technology,” he added.

Rashwan revealed that 21Shares, an issuer of exchange-traded products, is planning to add up to three ETPs over the next 3 months. He said European investors have been approaching the company to launch new products.

Created by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Polkadot is a cross-blockchain that enables transfers of any type of data or asset, not just tokens. It is also used as an electronic payment system.

DOT is now the world’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market capitalization of $16.55 billion, according to data from markets.Bitcoin.com. At the time of writing, DOT is trading at $17.22, up 8% over the past 24 hours.

Ukraine’s government-owned nuclear power plant picked a firm to build a massive data center in Rivne for cryptocurrency mining operations. After a bidding process, Energoatom chose Kyiv Energy Construction Company to handle the nuclear plant crypto mining project.

Nuclear Power Plant Operator Expects to Launch the Data Center in 2022

According to official documents, the data center will be based in the Rivne nuclear power plant, after the construction firm got 8.92 million Hryvnia ($317,620) in funding. The only competitor in the bidding was Ukrenergobudproek. However, they allegedly made an expensive offer, said the regional news outlet Forklog.

The Kyiv Energy Construction Company expects to finish the data center building by August 31, 2022. Per the announcement, the contractor is required to send the documentation that details the whole process. It includes “host state registers, electronic archives, and computing facilities.”

In terms of technical details, the nuclear power plant has a capacity of 2,657 megawatts, and it was built in the late 1970s. Also, the operations of the state-owned nuclear facilities started at the beginning of 1980.

In October 2020, Energoatom also signed a memorandum with a subsidiary of crypto mining giant Bitfury. With the new data center, local media outlets believe Bitfury miners could move their operations into the power plant’s facilities.

Ukraine’s Interest Towards Building Crypto Mining Data Centers in Nuclear Plants

The deal between Energoatom and Kyiv Energy Construction Company is not a surprising move. In fact, the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine asked Energoatom in May 2020 to conduct research to assess crypto mining’s feasibility at their nuclear plants.

As an anecdotal fact in terms of crypto mining in Ukrainian nuclear plants, the nation’s Security Service found illegal crypto mining equipment in a nuclear power plant in 2019.

The installation’s illegal mining rigs were found in the Southern region of Ukraine. Moreover, the investigations determined that such illegal equipment breached a “state secret.”

Global music distribution service Ditto has unveiled the latest addition to its service lineup for musicians with a blockchain-based financing platform named Opulous.

Opulous Peer-to-Peer Lending Platform Serves as a Loan Pool Designed to Help Artists

Ditto continues its efforts to improve the value chain for artists. Unlike other decentralized finance (defi) protocols, Opulous reflects asset-based lending, which bridges the physical and digital worlds. The Opulous’ defi lending mechanism, which is being developed on the Algorand public blockchain, leverages music copyrights’ tangibility through a smart contract setup that automatically handles principal and interest payments along with distributions to investors.

For musicians already receiving royalties, this presents a unique opportunity to monetize their assets or contribute to the pool to stake other artists. When seeking capital, artists can access funds by collateralizing loans from Opulous’ Music Copyright Pools with their music royalties.

Besides digitizing music as an asset class, the move will invite more democratized participation from artists and investors seeking to gain a foothold in the music industry, which is undergoing tremendous annual growth and expected to double in size by 2030. Artists benefit from interest rates starting as low as 4%, while investors in the copyright pools can add exposure to music royalties as an asset class for 10% returns per annum.

Per Ditto CEO Lee Parsons,

Opulous cuts out traditional banking, providing musicians with a platform with minimal interest payments, while giving investors the chance to stake a claim in one of the most exciting and fastest-growing financial industries in the world.

Ditto, which has already processed more than $1 billion in royalties for its 250,000-plus users, sees industry revenues doubling in the next ten years, building a compelling investment thesis. In keeping with Opulous’ mission to democratize musicians’ financial access, users outside the Ditto ecosystem are welcome to join the peer-to-peer lending framework.

Opulous has raised $1.5 million in funding to-date from BASIC, Borderless Capital, Kosmos Capital, Somesing, and TrustVerse. Roll out of the platform’s minimum viable product (MVP) is anticipated in two months as development proceeds.

Elastos, which built its decentralized application (dapp) platform and currency (ELA) to protect users’ digital assets and creations, will be among the first token staking partners for Opulous’ proof-of-stake consensus protocol. Opulous, in concert with Elastos, will allow investors to stake their Elastos (ELA) coins within the Music Copyright Pools.

According to Clarence Liu, the VP of Development at the Elastos Foundation,

Elastos and Ditto Music have been researching how blockchain can address fundamental inefficiencies in the music industry. Access to funding – which Opulous will address – is only the tip of the iceberg.

“Our collaboration has much more in the pipeline and our community is definitely set on using the forward momentum sparked by recent world events to introduce new users to the decentralized internet ideals set by Elastos,” Liu concludes.

During the last year, Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem has grown exponentially to form a multi Billion Dollar market. As Decentralized Finance expands, it becomes more and more relevant to have cross-chain connections that enable crypto assets to flow instantly and seamlessly across blockchain networks. These make it possible for DeFi platforms to be an effective alternative to centralized exchanges. Today, pNetwork launches the first EOS to Ethereum cross-chain connection to enable the EOS crypto asset to be moved into Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem.

EOS on Ethereum

EOS, the native token on the EOS blockchain, is a top20 cryptocurrency by market cap and the engine powering one of the most active dApps ecosystems. The asset counts over $ 3.5 Billion in daily trading volumes, figuring as the 9th most traded cryptocurrency. At present, only a fraction of the total is happening in a decentralized fashion.

While the DeFi ecosystem on EOS continues to grow, it has not yet reached Ethereum’s size. The latter powers Billions in daily trading volumes, Uniswap being the largestlarges liquidity protocol in existence and the fourth biggest DeFi protocol in terms of Total Value Locked.

Following the delivery of 26 bridges connecting six different blockchain protocols, including the cross-chain transfer of popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin, pNetwork launches today a new cross-chain connection that brings EOS to Ethereum.

As the first tokenised version of EOS, pEOS makes the asset compatible with Ethereum’s DeFi. This creates a benefit on both sides, enabling Ethereum’s DeFi protocols to expand their range of assets supported and granting EOS the option to be traded in a decentralized fashion as well as being supported as a collateral type by major Ethereum-based landing platforms.

Cross-chain connections are critical for a variety of use-cases, from NFTs to market making to decentralized indexes such as PieDAO’s Pies. pNetwork-powered asset tokenisation on Ethereum enables such indexes to represent the entire crypto market.

All pTokenised assets are pegged 1:1 to their underlying asset and are available for automated minting or redeeming on the pTokens dApp. In addition, pTokens are supported on a variety of DeFi protocols, decentralized exchanges and wallets on a growing number of blockchains.

Making Ethereum and EOS dApps Interoperable

Ethereum and EOS are two of the most active ecosystems for dApps, counting thousands of users each. By connecting these two blockchain environments, pNetwork aims to support the growth and development of decentralized applications such as lending/borrowing, trading, derivatives, and more. Acting as a cross-chain highway for cryptocurrencies to frictionlessly move from one blockchain to another, pNetwork powers the first bi-directional connection between the Ethereum and EOS blockchains.

Users on either blockchain are now able to interact with both ecosystems without ever leaving their blockchain of choice. Projects from both Ethereum and EOS communities have developed building blocks to create the next-generation financial system – with the connection between these two, users will find an even more powerful DeFi ecosystem.

By leveraging pNetwork’s cross-chain solution, dApps on the two blockchain platforms now have the opportunity to interoperate. Each ecosystem leveraging its counterpart’s strengths ultimately creates a benefit on both sides and sets the basis for sustainable growth. The presence of an EOS/ETH decentralized trading pair both with Ethereum’s and EOS’s decentralized finance, for example, makes it possible for market makers to arbitrage between the two blockchains. This results in a more liquid decentralized market for both assets.

Michael Rubinov, president of Kronos Advanced Technologies, commented on the company’s stance towards cryptocurrencies:

In the last ten years, much has been said about how cryptocurrency will revolutionize payments, services, businesses and will change the world the way we know it. Cryptocurrency has changed e-commerce: as more and more people now shop online. Cryptocurrency gives customers more reasons to utilize the convenience of online shopping, as it mitigates the risk of fraud for both vendors and shoppers.

By adopting dogecoin as a form of payment, Kronos also expect to market N95 masks to the entire meme coin community on Reddit, which has grown over 670,000 members. The company also praised the fact that Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk endorses dogecoin as one of his favorite cryptocurrencies.

Spacex and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been trying to get to the bottom of what happened with the popular trading app Robinhood when it stopped people from buying shares of hot stocks, like Gamestop. The shares of these stocks became popular due to the Wallstreetbets movement.

Elon Musk Says People Want the Truth From Robinhood

During an interview on The Good Time Show via the Clubhouse app Sunday night, Elon Musk grilled the CEO of trading app Robinhood, Vlad Tenev, over the company’s decision to restrict hot stocks last week, including Gamestop. On Friday, Robinhood also restricted crypto trading, citing “extraordinary market conditions.”

“What happened last week? Why can’t people buy the Gamestop shares? The people demand an answer and they want to know the details and the truth,” Musk said.

Tenev began by explaining the structure of his company. “Robinhood is actually a couple of companies,” he described. Robinhood Financial processes trades, Robinhood Securities clears and settles the trades, and Robinhood Crypto which deals with crypto trades.

The Robinhood CEO detailed that last Wednesday, his platform experienced “unprecedented volume” as “a lot of these so-called meme stocks were going viral on social media and people were joining Robinhood” to buy these stocks. Consequently, the company “received a file” from the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) Thursday morning at about 3:30 AM PST. It requested Robinhood to “put up money to the NSCC based on some factors,” including the volatility of certain securities. Tenev clarified that “this is the equities business so it’s based on stock trading and not options trading or anything else,” elaborating:

They gave us a file with a deposit and the request was around $3 billion dollars which is about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is.

Musk interrupted Tenev, questioning: “Why is that so high? It sounds like this is an unprecedented increase in demand for capital. What formula did they use to calculate that?”

Tenev replied: “We don’t have the full details. It’s a little bit of an opaque formula but there’s a component called the VAR of it, which is the Value at Risk, and that’s based on kind of some fairly quantitative things … and then there’s a special component which is discretionary so that kind of acts as a multiplier.” Tenev also noted that up until that point, his company “has raised a little bit around two billion dollars in total venture capital,” so the request was “a big number.”

The Tesla CEO interrupted again, asking: “What everyone wants to know is did something maybe shady go down here? It seems weird that you’d get a sudden $10 billion demand in the morning … suddenly out of nowhere.” Tenev swiftly corrected Musk that the number was $3 billion. The Robinhood CEO then emphasized:

I wouldn’t impugn shadiness to it or anything like that, and actually the NSCC was reasonable subsequent to this. They worked with us to actually lower it. It was unprecedented activity.

Musk abruptly asked Tenev: “Is there anyone holding you hostage right now?” Tenev chuckled and replied: “No, no, I’m okay. Thanks for asking.” Both laughed.

The Robinhood CEO proceeded to explain what happened, calling the experience “nerve-wrecking.” He said after receiving the request for $3 billion, his chief operating officer called up someone higher up at the NSCC to discuss what to do. “There was another call and they lowered it to something like $1.4 billion from $3 billion,” Tenev reiterated that it was still a high number. His company then proposed a plan to the NSCC of “marking these volatile stocks that were kind of driving the activity position-closing only.”

Then, at about 5 to 5:30 AM PST, before the market opened, the NSCC came back and reduced the deposit requirement to $700 million, “which we then deposited and paid promptly,” Tenev emphasized. Acknowledging that the move was bad for customers, the Robinhood CEO said, “We had no choice, in this case. We had to conform to our regulatory capital requirements and so the team did what they could to make sure we were available for customers.”

The Spacex CEO further questioned: “Who controls this organization, this clearinghouse?” Tenev replied: “It’s a consortium. It’s not quite a government agency. I don’t really know the details of all of that.” Nonetheless, he emphasized that “To be fair … I think there was legitimate sort of turmoil in the markets … so there probably is some amount of extra risk in the system that warrants higher requirements so it’s not entirely unreasonable.” He noted that lots of other brokers were in the same situation and had to restrict the same activity.

“So it sounds like this organization calls you up and they basically have a gun to your head: either hand over this money or else,” the Spacex CEO summarized, elaborating:

Basically, what people are wondering is did you sell your clients down the river or did you have no choice. If you had no choice, that’s understandable but then we got to find out why you had no choice and who are these people that are saying you have no choice.

“I think that’s fair. We have to comply with these requirements. Financial institutions have requirements,” Tenev responded. Nonetheless, he suggested that it would be helpful to know the formula the NSCC uses to calculate these requirements so companies can plan better.

Musk proceeded to ask about whether there was outside pressure forcing Robinhood to take the action it did. Tenev affirmed that there is “a rumor that Citadel or other market makers kind of pressured us into doing this.” However, he clarified, “that’s just false,” emphasizing that “this was a clearinghouse decision and it was just based on the capital requirements so from our perspective Citadel and other market makers weren’t involved in that.”

During the same Clubhouse interview, Elon also revealed that he is a supporter of bitcoin and should have bought the cryptocurrency eight years ago. He believes that bitcoin is on the verge of getting broad acceptance by traditional finance people. On Monday, Robinhood raised another $2.4 billion from shareholders after it secured $1 billion last Thursday.

PRESS RELEASE. The AdGram service was founded a year ago and is currently the largest advertising exchange in Telegram.

AdGram helps brands place large advertising volumes in channels and groups quickly and efficiently. Channels and groups benefit from expansion of their audience, it is easy to find advertisers and increase the earnings from advertising placements via AdGram.

Over the last 12 months, the service has gained a huge experience in communications with both advertisers and administrators from different countries, which has highlighted issues with settlements in multiple currencies. After overcoming these obstacles, it was decided that cryptocurrency could be the key to solving this problem.

With the termination of the Telegram team’s work on the TON project in May 2020 (the messenger lost one of its monetization methods), Free TON was launched which took over the development and popularization of TON Crystal using the open source code from the original TON. The uniqueness of FreeTON is that it is one of the few projects where all the tokens belong to the community and it is developing as a decentralized autonomous organization.

The potential of the underlying technology and the growth of the community inspired AdGram and in October 2020 they partnered with the FreeTON Community and fully integrated Crystal as a means of payment. Synergy with FreeTON made it possible to take a big step towards using cryptocurrencies as a single, simple and clear means of payment.

The ability to pay with tokens for advertising in Telegram creates a powerful use case for the TON Crystal token. Huge and constantly growing volume of the advertising market is vital for tokenomics as it creates supply and demand for market participants, thereby increasing the liquidity of the token itself.

For administrators and advertisers transactions in TON Crystal is simple, convenient and fast! It also solves the problem of collecting details for transfers in various currencies, and avoids paying banking fees.

Advertising on Telegram and the FreeTON blockchain, which is the successor of Durov’s original (but never happened Durov’s TON), create a strong and impact-resistant synergy of mutual benefits. This shows markets and communities can develop in a self-regulated environment.

PRESS RELEASE. CEX.IO LOAN experiences massive institutional demand for its crypto-backed lending service, with 41% of customers requesting to borrow cash against Bitcoin, 53% against Ethereum, and 6% against DeFi tokens.

Crypto-backed lending service CEX.IO LOAN that launched in October 2020 in select global jurisdictions, has been experiencing major demand, receiving over $100 million worth of loan requests to date. While the service has been widely popular among retail investors, most of the platform’s loan requests came from institutional investors.

According to CEX.IO LOAN, such an increase in demand can be attributed to the institutionalization of the cryptocurrency industry. Institutional investors, who have cryptocurrencies in their possession, regard it as a potential collateral for borrowing funds and actively utilise it as such. The borrowed funds are then used for further investment purposes.

In addition to featuring cutting-edge security and advanced anti-fraud measures, CEX.IO Group operates a regulated service, which has been licensed as a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) provider by the Gibraltar Financial Service Commission (GFSC) since last year. In addition to this, the Government of Gibraltar recently granted CEX.IO Limited a Money Lender License, allowing the firm to extend its ecosystem of regulated services with CEX.IO LOAN.

Institutional clients also prefer the company’s digital asset-backed lending service due to the convenience offered to users. On the CEX.IO LOAN platform, customers can borrow cash against their cryptocurrency assets in a quick and simple manner, without having to deal with credit checks or any unnecessary paperwork. To access the company’s instant crypto-backed lending service, new users have to open an account at the digital asset exchange and pass the mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML checks.

CEX.IO LOAN serves various cryptocurrency market participants, from retail investors, traders, and HODLers to startups, entrepreneurs, and large enterprises. As part of a flexible crypto-backed lending service, users can borrow any amount between $500 and $100,000 at competitive interest rates starting at 8.75% per year. Loan duration ranging from seven days to one year.

Currently, retail users can borrow funds against their Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) assets. Based on the company’s data, the feature has already experienced high demand from VIP clients, with 41% of all CEX.IO LOAN customers borrowing cash against Bitcoin (BTC), 53% against Ethereum (ETH), and 6% against DeFi tokens.

The company has recently introduced a VIP-exclusive feature to offer flexible lending conditions and the ability to use decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens as collateral for institutional clients on the crypto-backed lending platform.

Furthermore, to best serve institutional customers, the requests and queries of VIP clients are handled individually by dedicated personal managers on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Interestingly, 14% of CEX.IO VIP customers have already asked their personal managers about borrowing funds via the crypto-backed lending service.

“As institutional investors find the digital asset industry increasingly attractive, it’s a pleasure to serve them with our enterprise-grade instant crypto-backed loan platform. Security, convenience, and compliance are key priorities for corporate clients, which are features that we have been providing to all our clients in the rapidly growing CEX.IO ecosystem. Most importantly, we want to provide institutional clients with the best service. For that reason, VIP clients enjoy exclusive benefits, such as dedicated personal managers and flexible lending options, on the CEX.IO LOAN platform,” Anton Chashchin, Commercial Director for the CEX.IO LOAN service, stated.

In the announcement, the firm revealed further details about the size of the funds clients borrow on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Based on the company’s data, while retail investors borrow $1,400 on average, VIP clients request larger-sized loans that vary in size, with the typical amount being $1 million or higher.

Institutional clients do not just borrow more but also need the funds for more extended periods which usually range between 6 and 12 months. According to the company, this phenomenon indicates a long-term strategy for VIP clients to manage their assets.

PRESS RELEASE. PARSIQ, a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform connecting on-chain and off-chain applications in real-time, announced that its PRQ token is now listed on OKEx with USDT base pair.

Please take note of the following go-live schedule:

PRQ Deposit : 07:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Spot Trading : PRQ / USDT : 10:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Withdrawal : 10:00 January 29, 2021 (UTC)

PARSIQ is a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform that serves as a multi-level bridge between blockchains and off-chain applications. PARSIQ’s features automate the blockchain analytics and monitoring process, providing customizable workflows with real-time intelligence.

Developers and individual users can transform the blockchain data to their favorite off-chain application or web service.

Among the obvious use cases is monitoring the wallets of traders and ordinary users. Among the non-obvious are complex system integrations for financial institutions and DeFi projects that use the PARSIQ infrastructure to improve security, conduct audits, comply with regulatory requirements, AML, and expand their workflows in other ways.

The infrastructure underneath PARSIQ’s user interface is built with their proprietary programming language ParsiQL, and its users’ benefits are multiplying with each supported integration.

PRQ Token

PARSIQ Token (PRQ) is an essential piece of the PARSIQ platform that co-exists with FIAT payments for using its services. Payments within the platform that are made in PRQ tokens guarantee a discounted rate. During the first Epoch when PRQ tokens are used as payment for running Smart-Triggers users receive higher execution limits, unlock transport methods, and are able to propose features that can be added to the platform.

In October 2020, the PARSIQ team released plans for Epoch 2.0.

#1. Public Projects

With Public Projects users can subscribe to existing PARSIQ Projects that were pre-made by other users. By paying in PRQ, users that have subscribed to the Public Project will incentivize the creators to create interesting, complex, and more important – problem-solving projects.

#2. User Data and PRQ

Every single monitoring target (primitive of type address, a struct with the field of address type, table row) would require 1 PRQ to hold after the implementation. It means that if there are 1000 addresses (960 in the table as rows, 30 as primitives, 10 in the structs) then the User would need 1000 PRQ on the connected Ethereum Account balance.

#3. IQ Protocol

IQ Protocol will allow risk-free PRQ lending and collateral-less borrowing. Risk-free PRQ lending means that PRQ is not transferred from the lender’s address to the borrower’s address. Details on the algorithm are available in the dedicated explainer on PARSIQ’s blog.

#4. PRQBoost

PRQ Boost is a liquidity boost program to incentivize PRQ/ETH liquidity providers on Uniswap, which goes with the PRQBOOST utility tokens to increase rewards for liquidity providers.

PARSIQ is actively working to partner with major layer 1 blockchain protocols to expand the range of blockchain integrations and give projects that build on those protocols the ability to monitor and automate workflows between blockchain and off-chain.

PRESS RELEASE. YFX, the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts has just launched, adding an important piece to the DeFi money legos, and creating a direct competition against CEX on derivatives trading.

The most traded Bitcoin product in centralized exchanges is Bitcoin futures, which is 10 times bigger than spot trading in terms of the trading volume. But in DEX, spot trading platforms like Uniswap are occupying a large portion of the total trading volume, and there is not a single decentralized futures trading platform that could reach even 1/10 of Uniswap’s trading volume. What stops decentralized futures trading platforms from becoming 10 times bigger than Uniswap? Why are decentralized futures trading platforms performing worse than their centralized counterparts?

The main reason is that decentralized futures exchanges don’t currently provide an attractive futures product to compete with centralized futures exchanges. For instance, centralized futures exchanges like BitMex can provide 100x leverage on Bitcoin futures trading. On the other hand, decentralized futures exchanges like dYdX only offer 10x leverage. None of the decentralized exchanges can keep up with the 100x leverage offering from centralized exchanges.

YFX Descartes V1 uses QIC-AMM and a system de-risk mechanism to migrate perpetual futures trading from CEX to DEX without reducing the trading leverage, which makes YFX the first DEX that could offer 100x leverage on a perpetual contract. You can do everything on YFX that you can do on BitMex or OKEx. YFX is poised to compete directly against established centralized exchanges. YFX Descartes V1 runs on the TRON MainNet, for faster transaction times and cheaper gas fees compared to Ethereum. The YFX team is also working on Ethereum’s Layer 2 solution to provide pragmatic perpetual trading on DEX. YFX team plans to launch their DEX on Huobi Heco and Ethereum Test net in Q1, 2021.

About YFX

YFX is the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts. YFX Descartes V1 launched on the TRON MainNet, and all trades are held and processed by smart contracts. The main goal of the YFX team, which is formed by a group of engineers who have years of experience working on trading systems and blockchain, is to build a DEX that can compete with CEX on derivative trading.

The Wall Street Bets saga, an incredibly ridiculous story about a group of amateur Reddit investors who beat career Wall Street hedge funds at their own game, is to be made into a movie.

According to a report by online news site Deadline on Jan. 31, Metro Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) won the rights to produce the film in a bidding war involving major Hollywood movie houses.

The movie is to be based on a book proposed by author Ben Mezrich. Mezrich’s previous work, “The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding Of Facebook, a Tale Of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal,” was adapted into the motion picture “The Social Network.”

The title to his planned latest book offering is called “The Antisocial Network,” said the report, quoting sources familiar with the development. The book is expected to go out to publishers later this February, it said.

However, it is not yet clear what shape or structure the movie will take. MGM’s Michael DeLuca will produce the film. DeLuca also produced the Academy-Award winning The Social Network. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss will executive produce via their Winklevoss Pictures production company.

The Wall Street Bets group noticed that major hedge funds on Wall Street had been placing short bets against companies they considered to be dying. The funds particularly targeted Gamestop, the world’s largest video game retailer, continually shorting the company’s shares.

But the Redditors saw an opportunity to make profit and collectively bet the other way, buying shares and stock options. This resulted in the value of the Gamestop shares soaring by more than 2,600% in January.

Hedge funds that had shorted the stock incurred losses running into several billions of dollars. One fund, Melvin Capital, reportedly lost up to $7 billion to the “short squeeze” in January, forcing it to restructure its investment portfolio to ensure a faster escape in future “squeezes.”

The Reddit traders also extended the pump to a few other stocks considered to be dying, including AMC (which climbed over 900% in January), as well as Nokia and Blackberry. This surge of activity resulted in a major controversy when the trading app Robinhood began restricting trade on certain stocks.

Alongside the cryptocurrency’s meteoric climb over the back half of 2020 and early 2021, a curious phenomenon has unfolded; heightened profit-taking and conversion to fiat currencies. Data collected by Simplex, a fiat-crypto gateway, underscores this seemingly paradoxical development.

A Curious Race to Convert Crypto to Fiat Has Accompanied Bitcoin’s Latest Drive Higher

Sharing exclusive data with Bitcoin.com, Simplex cofounder and chief analytics officer Netanel Kabala says:

While the international press coverage of Bitcoin’s rally has caused a swathe of new users to flock to the industry and buy-in, outflows have been equally significant. Of the total amount of cryptocurrency sold in the last six months, 43% was off ramped in December alone.

A quick look at Google Trends for the term ‘Bitcoin’ echoes these developments, especially now that new equity instruments like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and big-name funds like Blackrock are adding exposure and raising crypto awareness.

Still, given the increased ability to quickly convert crypto and withdraw in fiat currencies, the uptick in funds leaving the ecosystem is astonishing. Part of this can be attributed to the growing fungibility of cryptocurrency, primarily helped by the support of players like Simplex, which empowers users to buy, sell, and spend crypto through Visa partnerships.

Although some of the latest rally’s onlookers have decried the rapid rise in crypto valuations as proof that a bubble is forming in this nascent asset class, others within the industry see the development as a harbinger of times to come. One of the areas this is most apparent is altcoins.

Data compiled by Simplex illustrates that as Bitcoin prices have leveled off above $30,000, daily purchases of altcoins have risen by approximately 65%. More interestingly, the data highlights that newer users account for nearly 20% of this volume, marking a sharp increase in the number of novice retail investors expanding and diversifying their exposure within the ecosystem.

Poloniex, one of the top 20 global cryptocurrency exchanges, which has adopted Simplex’s platform, has experienced these results firsthand. Karen McHenry, Poloniex’s Director of Product, attributes this development to greater access within the ecosystem, especially with Simplex’s buy option, which promotes instant account funding alongside the heightened ability to cash out quickly.

She also doesn’t see the ability to more quickly convert from crypto to fiat as harming interest despite the eyepopping amounts taken off exchanges.

It may sound surprising, but adding the ‘sell’ option actually has a positive impact on the number of crypto transactions too.

Though this easy offramp and soaring volume of sell orders might seem negative for prices, it can also be viewed as a healthy reflection of the ecosystem’s growing use cases. Besides making it easier to exit and enter, growing areas like decentralized finance (defi) and greater fungibility all contribute to a cryptocurrency’s value proposition.

As institutions begin lining up to add exposure as retail accumulation climbs, Bitcoin momentum may actually accelerate, and by extension, lift the altcoins sought after by the newcomers seeking opportunities outside the seminal crypto coin.

McHenry adds:

If the bull market can maintain its momentum, some of these BTC profits will flow into altcoins, which are particularly popular among retail investors. This creates a positive feedback loop, with traders who turn a profit prone to telling their friends about crypto, which brings more investment into the space.

Do you think the offramping will continue throughout 2021? Let us know in the comments sections below.

This past week, another social media trend started on the Reddit forum r/wallstreetbets, which aims to initiate a large silver short squeeze in order to push the price of the precious metal to $1,000 per ounce. However, the silver squeeze trend comes with controversy, as numerous wallstreetbets supporters believe hedge funds like Melvin Capital and Citadel are behind the silver push.

The Controversial ‘Silver Squeeze’

During the last week, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the wallstreetbets (WSB) saga taking place on social media forums and the infamous subreddit r/wallstreetbets. Since the mega short squeeze on the Gamestop (GME) shares, the squeeze maneuver has also spilled into a number of other stocks. This week, shares from the Russell 3000 Index (RUA) were targeted including tickers like NOK, GOGO, AMCX, and FIZZ. But the trend didn’t stop there, as one post, in particular, had called for a “silver squeeze.” The WSB Reddit post called for the silver squeeze to push the price of silver from $25 per ounce to $1,000.

Now since the post was published, the Reddit admins in charge of moderating r/wallstreetbets removed the post. But that was long after the message was made viral by the participants discussing the pros and cons of attempting to squeeze silver. Now the reason people think the silver short squeeze post may be shady, is because a number of WSB Redditors believe the silver squeeze was invoked by the hedge funds losing money in order to cover their GME losses. There are a great number of Reddit posts warning that people should not participate in the silver short squeeze.

One post said:

Citadel is the 5th largest owner of [silver], it’s imperative we do not ‘squeeze’ it. These are hedge fund bots spamming awards.

The people who dislike the silver trend on WSB, have also warned that Melvin Capital Management is also a big silver holder. Unfortunately, it is hard to tell where the silver pump threads and posts are stemming from, as there are many free-market supporters who are fans of the precious metal sometimes referred to as the ‘poor man’s gold.’

Despite this, there are numbers of WSB fans and Redditors claiming the silver pump stemmed from hedge fund people and they believe there are imposters everywhere now. Some of these people are growing irrational, getting mad at anyone who posts about silver. Many WSB supporters might be feeling the pain from Gamestop Corp. shares dropping significantly on Monday.

Silver soars past $30 a troy ounce as Reddit-fuelled buying frenzy continues for 3rd day. #Silversqueeze pic.twitter.com/mLmasUBrq1 — Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) February 1, 2021

In Spite of Controversy, Something Is Sparking Silver Demand

Despite the speculation, some sort of demand was invoked when it comes to silver prices and obtaining physical bullion. For instance, if you are attempting to purchase an ounce or ounces of silver bullion online, the process is far more complicated now than it was last week. A large portion of bars and coins are either sold out or the prices are marked up considerably.

This is simple arbitrage. #Silver futures are 28.67. Silver Eagles on Apmex are $41.66, thats a 45% premium to futures. Obvious opportunity to buy futures & stand for delivery for a 35% discount on physical right? But when they don't have it, Futures = $41.66/oz. #silversqueeze — Jonathan #SILVERSQUEEZE Mergott (@Jmergz1985) February 1, 2021

All the American Eagles are sold out across a number of bullion dealers. On Sunday morning, a few big-name dealers have halted a great number of silver sales. News.Bitcoin.com’s most recent WSB report disclosed how SD Bullion sold nearly 10x the number of silver ounces than usual. People visiting bullion dealer websites like Provident, Apmex, and JD Bullion could see the unprecedented demand targeting physical silver.

“In the last week, we have seen a dramatic shift in Silver demand from our customers,” said Ken Lewis CEO of the bullion dealer Apmex. “For example, the ratio of ounces sold per day was running about two times earlier in the week and closer to four times the average demand by the end of the week,” Lewis added.

The Apmex CEO further stressed:

Once markets closed on Friday, we saw demand hit as much as six times a typical business day and more than 12 times a normal weekend day. Combined with the extremely high demand levels, we are also seeing a surge in new customers. On Saturday alone, we added as many new customers as we usually add in a week.

Additionally, the hashtag “#silversqueeze” has been trending throughout the United States and a few other countries on Twitter during the last 48 hours. By the late afternoon on Sunday, spot silver and futures traded at $27 per Troy ounce, and by Monday morning spot silver traded 7.7% higher at $29.76. The commodity hopped above the $30 region, and silver prices per ounce exchanged hands at $30.35 an ounce. One ounce of .999 silver is hovering in the $29 price handle at the time of publication

CHAPTER ONE: Listening to the Past

“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.” — Satoshi Nakamoto

The trusted third party problem has haunted modern financial systems and centralized exchanges because people require an intermediary to make them work. The third party’s good or bad motives become a defining aspect of the transaction, and the those who use the institutions are at the mercy of those intentions. This is especially true of the current system of state-issued money and central banking.

A trustless system avoids intermediaries and does not depend upon the intentions of participants; that is, the system functions in the same manner regardless of anyone’s intentions. The blockchain, with a transparent and immutable peer-to peer protocol, is called trustless because there is no corruptible intermediary upon whom exchanges must depend.

On a small scale, the trusted third party problem may always exist because a middleman is useful or necessary in some situations. If third parties offer competitive services on a free market, however, the damage of dishonesty or incompetence is limited. People can take their business elsewhere, report a swindler to watchdogs, warn others, and file a lawsuit.

An occasionally dishonest third party is not the problem Satoshi addresses. He speaks to the institutionalized corruption of government and central banks from which the average person could not escape by using a competitor or by suing. Almost everyone who works over the table, runs a business, buys or sells goods, accepts government benefits or pays taxes has had to accept a fiat that constantly plunges in value due to inflation. Almost everyone who uses credit, accepts checks, takes out loans, conducts commerce or does business abroad has needed to go through banks that steal like drunken muggers.

For average people, the situation used to seem hopeless because no legal, practical, and private alternative existed for transferring funds across considerable distance, including borders. Attempts to reform or remove the system also seemed doomed because it was inherently corrupt and self-serving. In fact, fiat and central banking were serving the purpose for which they had been established: financial control by elites. People’s need for money and exchange became their straitjackets.

Then Satoshi. Then the blockchain and crypto. A new concept of money was created in a form that cannot not be inflated; the number of bitcoins is fixed at 21 million divisible units. The supply can only decrease when coins are lost, as inevitably happens. Satoshi notes, “Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.” Bitcoin solved the fiat problem.

A new concept of financial transfer solved the third party problem, especially with regard to banks. Although peer-to-peer transactions involve a middleman or miner, no trust is required since the transaction is released only when “proof of work” is rendered, which consists of solving a complicated math problem. Arriving at a solution may be costly in computer power and time, but the solutions themselves are easy to verify. Satoshi comments, “With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.” The soundness and propriety of the blockchain’s protocol itself is assured by the use of open source that is visible to all and verifiable. The political outcome: A private currency and method of exchange freed people from financial oppression.

The idea of private currency itself is hardly new, however.

Precedent in Radical Individualist Theory

The late Friedrich Hayek is the most respected Austrian economist of the 20th century. His book The Denationalisation of Money: An Analysis of the Theory and Practice of Concurrent Currencies argues vigorously for private and competitive currencies to displace government-issued ones. Hayek ponders a key question. “When one studies the history of money one cannot help wondering why people should have put up for so long with governments exercising an exclusive power over two thousand years that was regularly used to exploit and defraud them. This can be explained only by the myth” that government money was necessary “becoming so firmly established that it did not occur even to the professional students of these matters…ever to question it. But once the validity of the established doctrine is doubted its foundation is rapidly seen to be fragile.”

Governments reap incredible profits from debasing the currency, but the rigged game works only if people have no alternative but to play it. The political purpose of legal tender and banking laws is to grant a monopoly to the state, which permits the redistribution of wealth and power from average people upward to the elite of society. Fiat money and banking remains fragile, however, because the system relies on people either not understanding the dynamics or not having a choice. Hayek wonders why public understanding is so elusive. Why was “a government monopoly of the provision of money…universally regarded as indispensable” and what would happen “if the provision of money were thrown open to the competition of private concerns supplying different currencies?”

With eerie prescience, Hayek argues for currencies developed by entrepreneurs who innovate new forms of money just as they innovate in other areas. One of the drawbacks of government’s monopoly is that it imposes a freeze on the sort of invention that now runs free in crypto. The voluntaryist historian Carl Watner observes, “No one can tell in advance what form these monies might take because no one can know for sure what choices individuals would make or what new technologies might be discovered. Laws forcing people to use the Federal Reserve System money have frozen monetary developments at a certain stage…Just imagine if Congress had protected the Post Office by passing laws that would have prevented people from communicating via the internet. We would never have experienced the marvels of e-mail.”

The late Austrian economist Murray Rothbard also wrestles with the question of “why do people so vigorously resist private currencies?” His book For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto advances an explanation. “If the government and only the government had had a monopoly of the shoe manufacturing and retailing business, how would most of the public treat the libertarian who now came along to advocate that the government get out of the shoe business and throw it open to private enterprise?” Rothbard predicts that the skeptics would attack the libertarian for depriving them of the only possible source of shoes—the government. People are thoroughly indoctrinated to believe that daily life cannot function without the state and fiat.

Hayek and Rothbard are unusual among free-market economists in their embrace of private money and monetary systems. Even laissez-faire zealots rarely champion free-market currencies or private banking. Instead, they debate marginal issues such as fractional reserve and other reforms they think will improve the existing system. Or they argue for the restoration of a gold standard as though it were a panacea. But if a gold standard were applied to fiat, the system would still require people to trust the government and banks. This means trusting both institutions to act against their own interests, which they have historically neglected to do.

The modern neglect of free-market money and banking is odd because 19th century radical individualists focused intensely on the importance of private money and private banking to personal freedom. They placed a primal emphasis on the right of every individual to create his own currency and to function as his own bank. It was a natural right as important as freedom of speech or of religion. The pivotal individualist Benjamin Tucker believed that the right to issue private currency was so important that it could destroy the State all by itself. His reasoning: The money monopoly, including control of credit, was how the State sustained itself and robbed average people not merely of wealth but also of economic opportunity.

Two specific events sculpted the approach that the early individualist-anarchists adopted toward the monetary monopoly. One was the Panic of 1837 that tipped the United States into recession until the mid-1840s. Commonly cited causes of the Panic include a collapsing land bubble and a sharp fall in cotton prices. Blame is also placed at the feet of President Andrew Jackson for vetoing the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States and precipitating an unfortunate chain of economic events. Drawing on the work of Professor of Economics Peter Temin, Rothbard disputes this interpretation.

First, he [Temin] points out that the price inflation really began earlier, when wholesale prices reached a trough of 82 in July 1830 and then rose by 20.7 percent in three years to reach 99 in the fall of 1833. The reason for the price rise is simple: The total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $159 million in 1833, an increase of 45.9 percent, or an annual rise of 15.3 percent. Breaking the figures down further, the total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $155 million a year and a half later, a spectacular expansion of 35 percent. Unquestionably, this monetary expansion was spurred by the still-flourishing Bank of the United States, which increased its notes and deposits from January 1830 to January 1832 from a total of $29 million to $42.1 million, a rise of 45.2 percent. Thus, the price and money inflation in the first few years of the 1830s were again sparked by the expansion of the still-dominant central bank.

Arguably, the Panic began in May 1837 when banks in New York City announced they would not redeem commercial paper for specie at full face value. Of the approximately 800 banks in America, all but six ceased at one point or another to redeem banknotes and deposits for gold or silver coins. Suspicion and hatred of traditional banks and government-issued money soared, with radicals scrutinizing alternate systems.

The other event dramatically to impact the radical fever from monetary reform was the Civil War for which the North financed its fighting through Legal Tender Acts and the National Banking Act of 1863.

The radicals did not merely theorize; they experimented with private currencies and new economic models. Their efforts are fascinating, but they are also cautionary tales. A major problem for 19th-century individualist-anarchism was the movement’s general acceptance of a link between sound money and the labor theory of value. This theory states that the true value of a good or service is based on the labor required to produce it rather than the price at which a seller and buyer are willing to exchange. In short, a good has intrinsic and not subjective value. (More on this in the section on the Regression Theorem.) Happily, their main economic goal was the abolition of the “money monopoly.” The term referred to three different but interacting forms of monopoly: banking, the charging of interest, and the privileged issuance of currency. The abolition of state power over currency was the focus, and they eschewed the use of force to implement their own schemes.

Josiah Warren provided a real-world example of what was meant by a currency that rested on the labor theory of value. Credited with being the first American anarchist, Warren tested his specific solution to the money monopoly through a Time Store from which he issued “Labor Notes.” In 1827, the business opened with $300 worth of groceries and dry goods that were offered at a 7 percent markup from Warren’s own costs in order to cover expenses such as overhead. This was before groceries were prepackaged or preweighed, and it was usual for buyers to bargain with the shopkeeper rather than pay a posted price. One of

Warren’s innovations was to post prices, which drove costs lower because transactions consumed less time. The customer paid in traditional money for the goods and paid with a Labor Note to compensate Warren for his time. The Labor Note obliged the customer to provide Warren with an equivalent amount of his time. If the buyer was a seamstress, for example, the Labor Note committed her to render to Warren X units of time to produce clothing. Warren’s goal was to establish an economy—or to establish a proof of principle, at least—in which profit was based on the exchange of time and labor. The Labor Notes were circulated and traded widely with in the community.

To some degree, Warren succeeded. People traveled from a hundred miles away to avail themselves of the Time Store’s low prices. After a few years, he declared the experiment to be a success and closed the store. Whether the Labor Notes were a success is questionable, however. The store itself may well have succeeded due to its low prices, not to the Notes. Whichever explanation is true, it is difficult to see how this novel currency could function in dense populations or on a grander scale of commerce. Few people today would be convinced of the viability of private money based on the Time Store experiment.

What could convince the public and economists that private currencies work as well or better than government-issued ones? Going back a bit further in American history is a good place to start because the future is always based on the past.

21Shares AG, a Zurich-based investment provider, is launching what is being dubbed as the world’s first Polkadot exchange-traded product, or ETP.

The DOT ETP will be listed on the Swiss exchange SIX on Thursday, February 4, said the company in a statement on Tuesday. DOT is the native token of the Polkadot network.

DOT has since been added to 21Shares’ Crypto Basket ETP (HODL), which tracks five major assets including bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH). Since its addition on Jan. 29, DOT now accounts for 27% of the product behind BTC at 50%.

Hany Rashwan, chief executive officer of 21Shares, said the firm has seen “unprecedented demand” from institutional investors wanting exposure to crypto-assets. He stated that demand for its range of crypto ETPs has soared 500% since the third quarter of 2020, but there has been “a recent surge in interest” for DOT.

“After investors purchase their first bitcoins through our ETPs, there is a natural transition to invest in other crypto assets,” Rashwan detailed.

“We benefit from trusted partners for the liquidity provision and upon continued institutional demand, we are launching the DOT ETP to give investors a safe, regulated, and easy way to obtain exposure to this exciting new blockchain technology,” he added.

Rashwan revealed that 21Shares, an issuer of exchange-traded products, is planning to add up to three ETPs over the next 3 months. He said European investors have been approaching the company to launch new products.

Created by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Polkadot is a cross-blockchain that enables transfers of any type of data or asset, not just tokens. It is also used as an electronic payment system.

DOT is now the world’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market capitalization of $16.55 billion, according to data from markets.Bitcoin.com. At the time of writing, DOT is trading at $17.22, up 8% over the past 24 hours.

Ukraine’s government-owned nuclear power plant picked a firm to build a massive data center in Rivne for cryptocurrency mining operations. After a bidding process, Energoatom chose Kyiv Energy Construction Company to handle the nuclear plant crypto mining project.

Nuclear Power Plant Operator Expects to Launch the Data Center in 2022

According to official documents, the data center will be based in the Rivne nuclear power plant, after the construction firm got 8.92 million Hryvnia ($317,620) in funding. The only competitor in the bidding was Ukrenergobudproek. However, they allegedly made an expensive offer, said the regional news outlet Forklog.

The Kyiv Energy Construction Company expects to finish the data center building by August 31, 2022. Per the announcement, the contractor is required to send the documentation that details the whole process. It includes “host state registers, electronic archives, and computing facilities.”

In terms of technical details, the nuclear power plant has a capacity of 2,657 megawatts, and it was built in the late 1970s. Also, the operations of the state-owned nuclear facilities started at the beginning of 1980.

In October 2020, Energoatom also signed a memorandum with a subsidiary of crypto mining giant Bitfury. With the new data center, local media outlets believe Bitfury miners could move their operations into the power plant’s facilities.

Ukraine’s Interest Towards Building Crypto Mining Data Centers in Nuclear Plants

The deal between Energoatom and Kyiv Energy Construction Company is not a surprising move. In fact, the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine asked Energoatom in May 2020 to conduct research to assess crypto mining’s feasibility at their nuclear plants.

As an anecdotal fact in terms of crypto mining in Ukrainian nuclear plants, the nation’s Security Service found illegal crypto mining equipment in a nuclear power plant in 2019.

The installation’s illegal mining rigs were found in the Southern region of Ukraine. Moreover, the investigations determined that such illegal equipment breached a “state secret.”

Global music distribution service Ditto has unveiled the latest addition to its service lineup for musicians with a blockchain-based financing platform named Opulous.

Opulous Peer-to-Peer Lending Platform Serves as a Loan Pool Designed to Help Artists

Ditto continues its efforts to improve the value chain for artists. Unlike other decentralized finance (defi) protocols, Opulous reflects asset-based lending, which bridges the physical and digital worlds. The Opulous’ defi lending mechanism, which is being developed on the Algorand public blockchain, leverages music copyrights’ tangibility through a smart contract setup that automatically handles principal and interest payments along with distributions to investors.

For musicians already receiving royalties, this presents a unique opportunity to monetize their assets or contribute to the pool to stake other artists. When seeking capital, artists can access funds by collateralizing loans from Opulous’ Music Copyright Pools with their music royalties.

Besides digitizing music as an asset class, the move will invite more democratized participation from artists and investors seeking to gain a foothold in the music industry, which is undergoing tremendous annual growth and expected to double in size by 2030. Artists benefit from interest rates starting as low as 4%, while investors in the copyright pools can add exposure to music royalties as an asset class for 10% returns per annum.

Per Ditto CEO Lee Parsons,

Opulous cuts out traditional banking, providing musicians with a platform with minimal interest payments, while giving investors the chance to stake a claim in one of the most exciting and fastest-growing financial industries in the world.

Ditto, which has already processed more than $1 billion in royalties for its 250,000-plus users, sees industry revenues doubling in the next ten years, building a compelling investment thesis. In keeping with Opulous’ mission to democratize musicians’ financial access, users outside the Ditto ecosystem are welcome to join the peer-to-peer lending framework.

Opulous has raised $1.5 million in funding to-date from BASIC, Borderless Capital, Kosmos Capital, Somesing, and TrustVerse. Roll out of the platform’s minimum viable product (MVP) is anticipated in two months as development proceeds.

Elastos, which built its decentralized application (dapp) platform and currency (ELA) to protect users’ digital assets and creations, will be among the first token staking partners for Opulous’ proof-of-stake consensus protocol. Opulous, in concert with Elastos, will allow investors to stake their Elastos (ELA) coins within the Music Copyright Pools.

According to Clarence Liu, the VP of Development at the Elastos Foundation,

Elastos and Ditto Music have been researching how blockchain can address fundamental inefficiencies in the music industry. Access to funding – which Opulous will address – is only the tip of the iceberg.

During the last year, Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem has grown exponentially to form a multi Billion Dollar market. As Decentralized Finance expands, it becomes more and more relevant to have cross-chain connections that enable crypto assets to flow instantly and seamlessly across blockchain networks. These make it possible for DeFi platforms to be an effective alternative to centralized exchanges. Today, pNetwork launches the first EOS to Ethereum cross-chain connection to enable the EOS crypto asset to be moved into Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem.

EOS on Ethereum

EOS, the native token on the EOS blockchain, is a top20 cryptocurrency by market cap and the engine powering one of the most active dApps ecosystems. The asset counts over $ 3.5 Billion in daily trading volumes, figuring as the 9th most traded cryptocurrency. At present, only a fraction of the total is happening in a decentralized fashion.

While the DeFi ecosystem on EOS continues to grow, it has not yet reached Ethereum’s size. The latter powers Billions in daily trading volumes, Uniswap being the largestlarges liquidity protocol in existence and the fourth biggest DeFi protocol in terms of Total Value Locked.

Following the delivery of 26 bridges connecting six different blockchain protocols, including the cross-chain transfer of popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin, pNetwork launches today a new cross-chain connection that brings EOS to Ethereum.

As the first tokenised version of EOS, pEOS makes the asset compatible with Ethereum’s DeFi. This creates a benefit on both sides, enabling Ethereum’s DeFi protocols to expand their range of assets supported and granting EOS the option to be traded in a decentralized fashion as well as being supported as a collateral type by major Ethereum-based landing platforms.

Cross-chain connections are critical for a variety of use-cases, from NFTs to market making to decentralized indexes such as PieDAO’s Pies. pNetwork-powered asset tokenisation on Ethereum enables such indexes to represent the entire crypto market.

All pTokenised assets are pegged 1:1 to their underlying asset and are available for automated minting or redeeming on the pTokens dApp. In addition, pTokens are supported on a variety of DeFi protocols, decentralized exchanges and wallets on a growing number of blockchains.

Making Ethereum and EOS dApps Interoperable

Ethereum and EOS are two of the most active ecosystems for dApps, counting thousands of users each. By connecting these two blockchain environments, pNetwork aims to support the growth and development of decentralized applications such as lending/borrowing, trading, derivatives, and more. Acting as a cross-chain highway for cryptocurrencies to frictionlessly move from one blockchain to another, pNetwork powers the first bi-directional connection between the Ethereum and EOS blockchains.

Users on either blockchain are now able to interact with both ecosystems without ever leaving their blockchain of choice. Projects from both Ethereum and EOS communities have developed building blocks to create the next-generation financial system – with the connection between these two, users will find an even more powerful DeFi ecosystem.

By leveraging pNetwork’s cross-chain solution, dApps on the two blockchain platforms now have the opportunity to interoperate. Each ecosystem leveraging its counterpart’s strengths ultimately creates a benefit on both sides and sets the basis for sustainable growth. The presence of an EOS/ETH decentralized trading pair both with Ethereum’s and EOS’s decentralized finance, for example, makes it possible for market makers to arbitrage between the two blockchains. This results in a more liquid decentralized market for both assets.

As the so-called ‘meme coin’ is actively making the headlines within the crypto sphere, a publicly-traded company is joining the dogecoin frenzy. Kronos Advanced Technology announced they’ll start accepting dogecoin as one of its payment methods.

Kronos Also Accepts Other Cryptocurrencies Such as Bitcoin and Ether

According to the announcement, the Los Angeles-based firm is adding dogecoin (DOGE) to its accepted payment form. In fact, customers will be able to purchase air purifiers, and personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies via the meme coin.

Adopting dogecoin as a payment method was not as part as just of a crypto adoption-driven maneuver. The company praised the popularity of the token and its uniqueness within the industry.

Also, Kronos pointed out that dogecoins transactions’ speed is a positive note for the Shiba Inu inspired meme token. So far, the company accepts several cryptos as payment methods, such as bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), litecoin (LTC), among others.

Expanding N95 Mask Market Into the Dogecoin Community

Michael Rubinov, president of Kronos Advanced Technologies, commented on the company’s stance towards cryptocurrencies:

In the last ten years, much has been said about how cryptocurrency will revolutionize payments, services, businesses and will change the world the way we know it. Cryptocurrency has changed e-commerce: as more and more people now shop online. Cryptocurrency gives customers more reasons to utilize the convenience of online shopping, as it mitigates the risk of fraud for both vendors and shoppers.

By adopting dogecoin as a form of payment, Kronos also expect to market N95 masks to the entire meme coin community on Reddit, which has grown over 670,000 members. The company also praised the fact that Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk endorses dogecoin as one of his favorite cryptocurrencies.

Despite the recent frenzy seen in the meme coin, the latest markets.Bitcoin.com data shows that dogecoin is exchanging hands at $0.0317, down -20.43% on Tuesday. The market capitalization still stands at $4.08 billion.

Spacex and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been trying to get to the bottom of what happened with the popular trading app Robinhood when it stopped people from buying shares of hot stocks, like Gamestop. The shares of these stocks became popular due to the Wallstreetbets movement.

Elon Musk Says People Want the Truth From Robinhood

During an interview on The Good Time Show via the Clubhouse app Sunday night, Elon Musk grilled the CEO of trading app Robinhood, Vlad Tenev, over the company’s decision to restrict hot stocks last week, including Gamestop. On Friday, Robinhood also restricted crypto trading, citing “extraordinary market conditions.”

“What happened last week? Why can’t people buy the Gamestop shares? The people demand an answer and they want to know the details and the truth,” Musk said.

Tenev began by explaining the structure of his company. “Robinhood is actually a couple of companies,” he described. Robinhood Financial processes trades, Robinhood Securities clears and settles the trades, and Robinhood Crypto which deals with crypto trades.

The Robinhood CEO detailed that last Wednesday, his platform experienced “unprecedented volume” as “a lot of these so-called meme stocks were going viral on social media and people were joining Robinhood” to buy these stocks. Consequently, the company “received a file” from the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) Thursday morning at about 3:30 AM PST. It requested Robinhood to “put up money to the NSCC based on some factors,” including the volatility of certain securities. Tenev clarified that “this is the equities business so it’s based on stock trading and not options trading or anything else,” elaborating:

They gave us a file with a deposit and the request was around $3 billion dollars which is about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is.

Musk interrupted Tenev, questioning: “Why is that so high? It sounds like this is an unprecedented increase in demand for capital. What formula did they use to calculate that?”

Tenev replied: “We don’t have the full details. It’s a little bit of an opaque formula but there’s a component called the VAR of it, which is the Value at Risk, and that’s based on kind of some fairly quantitative things … and then there’s a special component which is discretionary so that kind of acts as a multiplier.” Tenev also noted that up until that point, his company “has raised a little bit around two billion dollars in total venture capital,” so the request was “a big number.”

The Tesla CEO interrupted again, asking: “What everyone wants to know is did something maybe shady go down here? It seems weird that you’d get a sudden $10 billion demand in the morning … suddenly out of nowhere.” Tenev swiftly corrected Musk that the number was $3 billion. The Robinhood CEO then emphasized:

I wouldn’t impugn shadiness to it or anything like that, and actually the NSCC was reasonable subsequent to this. They worked with us to actually lower it. It was unprecedented activity.

Musk abruptly asked Tenev: “Is there anyone holding you hostage right now?” Tenev chuckled and replied: “No, no, I’m okay. Thanks for asking.” Both laughed.

The Robinhood CEO proceeded to explain what happened, calling the experience “nerve-wrecking.” He said after receiving the request for $3 billion, his chief operating officer called up someone higher up at the NSCC to discuss what to do. “There was another call and they lowered it to something like $1.4 billion from $3 billion,” Tenev reiterated that it was still a high number. His company then proposed a plan to the NSCC of “marking these volatile stocks that were kind of driving the activity position-closing only.”

Then, at about 5 to 5:30 AM PST, before the market opened, the NSCC came back and reduced the deposit requirement to $700 million, “which we then deposited and paid promptly,” Tenev emphasized. Acknowledging that the move was bad for customers, the Robinhood CEO said, “We had no choice, in this case. We had to conform to our regulatory capital requirements and so the team did what they could to make sure we were available for customers.”

The Spacex CEO further questioned: “Who controls this organization, this clearinghouse?” Tenev replied: “It’s a consortium. It’s not quite a government agency. I don’t really know the details of all of that.” Nonetheless, he emphasized that “To be fair … I think there was legitimate sort of turmoil in the markets … so there probably is some amount of extra risk in the system that warrants higher requirements so it’s not entirely unreasonable.” He noted that lots of other brokers were in the same situation and had to restrict the same activity.

“So it sounds like this organization calls you up and they basically have a gun to your head: either hand over this money or else,” the Spacex CEO summarized, elaborating:

Basically, what people are wondering is did you sell your clients down the river or did you have no choice. If you had no choice, that’s understandable but then we got to find out why you had no choice and who are these people that are saying you have no choice.

“I think that’s fair. We have to comply with these requirements. Financial institutions have requirements,” Tenev responded. Nonetheless, he suggested that it would be helpful to know the formula the NSCC uses to calculate these requirements so companies can plan better.

Musk proceeded to ask about whether there was outside pressure forcing Robinhood to take the action it did. Tenev affirmed that there is “a rumor that Citadel or other market makers kind of pressured us into doing this.” However, he clarified, “that’s just false,” emphasizing that “this was a clearinghouse decision and it was just based on the capital requirements so from our perspective Citadel and other market makers weren’t involved in that.”

During the same Clubhouse interview, Elon also revealed that he is a supporter of bitcoin and should have bought the cryptocurrency eight years ago. He believes that bitcoin is on the verge of getting broad acceptance by traditional finance people. On Monday, Robinhood raised another $2.4 billion from shareholders after it secured $1 billion last Thursday.

PRESS RELEASE. The AdGram service was founded a year ago and is currently the largest advertising exchange in Telegram.

AdGram helps brands place large advertising volumes in channels and groups quickly and efficiently. Channels and groups benefit from expansion of their audience, it is easy to find advertisers and increase the earnings from advertising placements via AdGram.

Over the last 12 months, the service has gained a huge experience in communications with both advertisers and administrators from different countries, which has highlighted issues with settlements in multiple currencies. After overcoming these obstacles, it was decided that cryptocurrency could be the key to solving this problem.

With the termination of the Telegram team’s work on the TON project in May 2020 (the messenger lost one of its monetization methods), Free TON was launched which took over the development and popularization of TON Crystal using the open source code from the original TON. The uniqueness of FreeTON is that it is one of the few projects where all the tokens belong to the community and it is developing as a decentralized autonomous organization.

The potential of the underlying technology and the growth of the community inspired AdGram and in October 2020 they partnered with the FreeTON Community and fully integrated Crystal as a means of payment. Synergy with FreeTON made it possible to take a big step towards using cryptocurrencies as a single, simple and clear means of payment.

The ability to pay with tokens for advertising in Telegram creates a powerful use case for the TON Crystal token. Huge and constantly growing volume of the advertising market is vital for tokenomics as it creates supply and demand for market participants, thereby increasing the liquidity of the token itself.

For administrators and advertisers transactions in TON Crystal is simple, convenient and fast! It also solves the problem of collecting details for transfers in various currencies, and avoids paying banking fees.

Advertising on Telegram and the FreeTON blockchain, which is the successor of Durov’s original (but never happened Durov’s TON), create a strong and impact-resistant synergy of mutual benefits. This shows markets and communities can develop in a self-regulated environment.

PRESS RELEASE. CEX.IO LOAN experiences massive institutional demand for its crypto-backed lending service, with 41% of customers requesting to borrow cash against Bitcoin, 53% against Ethereum, and 6% against DeFi tokens.

Crypto-backed lending service CEX.IO LOAN that launched in October 2020 in select global jurisdictions, has been experiencing major demand, receiving over $100 million worth of loan requests to date. While the service has been widely popular among retail investors, most of the platform’s loan requests came from institutional investors.

According to CEX.IO LOAN, such an increase in demand can be attributed to the institutionalization of the cryptocurrency industry. Institutional investors, who have cryptocurrencies in their possession, regard it as a potential collateral for borrowing funds and actively utilise it as such. The borrowed funds are then used for further investment purposes.

In addition to featuring cutting-edge security and advanced anti-fraud measures, CEX.IO Group operates a regulated service, which has been licensed as a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) provider by the Gibraltar Financial Service Commission (GFSC) since last year. In addition to this, the Government of Gibraltar recently granted CEX.IO Limited a Money Lender License, allowing the firm to extend its ecosystem of regulated services with CEX.IO LOAN.

Institutional clients also prefer the company’s digital asset-backed lending service due to the convenience offered to users. On the CEX.IO LOAN platform, customers can borrow cash against their cryptocurrency assets in a quick and simple manner, without having to deal with credit checks or any unnecessary paperwork. To access the company’s instant crypto-backed lending service, new users have to open an account at the digital asset exchange and pass the mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML checks.

CEX.IO LOAN serves various cryptocurrency market participants, from retail investors, traders, and HODLers to startups, entrepreneurs, and large enterprises. As part of a flexible crypto-backed lending service, users can borrow any amount between $500 and $100,000 at competitive interest rates starting at 8.75% per year. Loan duration ranging from seven days to one year.

Currently, retail users can borrow funds against their Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) assets. Based on the company’s data, the feature has already experienced high demand from VIP clients, with 41% of all CEX.IO LOAN customers borrowing cash against Bitcoin (BTC), 53% against Ethereum (ETH), and 6% against DeFi tokens.

The company has recently introduced a VIP-exclusive feature to offer flexible lending conditions and the ability to use decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens as collateral for institutional clients on the crypto-backed lending platform.

Furthermore, to best serve institutional customers, the requests and queries of VIP clients are handled individually by dedicated personal managers on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Interestingly, 14% of CEX.IO VIP customers have already asked their personal managers about borrowing funds via the crypto-backed lending service.

“As institutional investors find the digital asset industry increasingly attractive, it’s a pleasure to serve them with our enterprise-grade instant crypto-backed loan platform. Security, convenience, and compliance are key priorities for corporate clients, which are features that we have been providing to all our clients in the rapidly growing CEX.IO ecosystem. Most importantly, we want to provide institutional clients with the best service. For that reason, VIP clients enjoy exclusive benefits, such as dedicated personal managers and flexible lending options, on the CEX.IO LOAN platform,” Anton Chashchin, Commercial Director for the CEX.IO LOAN service, stated.

In the announcement, the firm revealed further details about the size of the funds clients borrow on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Based on the company’s data, while retail investors borrow $1,400 on average, VIP clients request larger-sized loans that vary in size, with the typical amount being $1 million or higher.

Institutional clients do not just borrow more but also need the funds for more extended periods which usually range between 6 and 12 months. According to the company, this phenomenon indicates a long-term strategy for VIP clients to manage their assets.

PRESS RELEASE. PARSIQ, a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform connecting on-chain and off-chain applications in real-time, announced that its PRQ token is now listed on OKEx with USDT base pair.

Please take note of the following go-live schedule:

PRQ Deposit : 07:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Spot Trading : PRQ / USDT : 10:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Withdrawal : 10:00 January 29, 2021 (UTC)

PARSIQ is a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform that serves as a multi-level bridge between blockchains and off-chain applications. PARSIQ’s features automate the blockchain analytics and monitoring process, providing customizable workflows with real-time intelligence.

Developers and individual users can transform the blockchain data to their favorite off-chain application or web service.

Among the obvious use cases is monitoring the wallets of traders and ordinary users. Among the non-obvious are complex system integrations for financial institutions and DeFi projects that use the PARSIQ infrastructure to improve security, conduct audits, comply with regulatory requirements, AML, and expand their workflows in other ways.

The infrastructure underneath PARSIQ’s user interface is built with their proprietary programming language ParsiQL, and its users’ benefits are multiplying with each supported integration.

PRQ Token

PARSIQ Token (PRQ) is an essential piece of the PARSIQ platform that co-exists with FIAT payments for using its services. Payments within the platform that are made in PRQ tokens guarantee a discounted rate. During the first Epoch when PRQ tokens are used as payment for running Smart-Triggers users receive higher execution limits, unlock transport methods, and are able to propose features that can be added to the platform.

In October 2020, the PARSIQ team released plans for Epoch 2.0.

#1. Public Projects

With Public Projects users can subscribe to existing PARSIQ Projects that were pre-made by other users. By paying in PRQ, users that have subscribed to the Public Project will incentivize the creators to create interesting, complex, and more important – problem-solving projects.

#2. User Data and PRQ

Every single monitoring target (primitive of type address, a struct with the field of address type, table row) would require 1 PRQ to hold after the implementation. It means that if there are 1000 addresses (960 in the table as rows, 30 as primitives, 10 in the structs) then the User would need 1000 PRQ on the connected Ethereum Account balance.

#3. IQ Protocol

IQ Protocol will allow risk-free PRQ lending and collateral-less borrowing. Risk-free PRQ lending means that PRQ is not transferred from the lender’s address to the borrower’s address. Details on the algorithm are available in the dedicated explainer on PARSIQ’s blog.

#4. PRQBoost

PRQ Boost is a liquidity boost program to incentivize PRQ/ETH liquidity providers on Uniswap, which goes with the PRQBOOST utility tokens to increase rewards for liquidity providers.

PARSIQ is actively working to partner with major layer 1 blockchain protocols to expand the range of blockchain integrations and give projects that build on those protocols the ability to monitor and automate workflows between blockchain and off-chain.

PRESS RELEASE. YFX, the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts has just launched, adding an important piece to the DeFi money legos, and creating a direct competition against CEX on derivatives trading.

The most traded Bitcoin product in centralized exchanges is Bitcoin futures, which is 10 times bigger than spot trading in terms of the trading volume. But in DEX, spot trading platforms like Uniswap are occupying a large portion of the total trading volume, and there is not a single decentralized futures trading platform that could reach even 1/10 of Uniswap’s trading volume. What stops decentralized futures trading platforms from becoming 10 times bigger than Uniswap? Why are decentralized futures trading platforms performing worse than their centralized counterparts?

The main reason is that decentralized futures exchanges don’t currently provide an attractive futures product to compete with centralized futures exchanges. For instance, centralized futures exchanges like BitMex can provide 100x leverage on Bitcoin futures trading. On the other hand, decentralized futures exchanges like dYdX only offer 10x leverage. None of the decentralized exchanges can keep up with the 100x leverage offering from centralized exchanges.

YFX Descartes V1 uses QIC-AMM and a system de-risk mechanism to migrate perpetual futures trading from CEX to DEX without reducing the trading leverage, which makes YFX the first DEX that could offer 100x leverage on a perpetual contract. You can do everything on YFX that you can do on BitMex or OKEx. YFX is poised to compete directly against established centralized exchanges. YFX Descartes V1 runs on the TRON MainNet, for faster transaction times and cheaper gas fees compared to Ethereum. The YFX team is also working on Ethereum’s Layer 2 solution to provide pragmatic perpetual trading on DEX. YFX team plans to launch their DEX on Huobi Heco and Ethereum Test net in Q1, 2021.

About YFX

YFX is the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts. YFX Descartes V1 launched on the TRON MainNet, and all trades are held and processed by smart contracts. The main goal of the YFX team, which is formed by a group of engineers who have years of experience working on trading systems and blockchain, is to build a DEX that can compete with CEX on derivative trading.

The Wall Street Bets saga, an incredibly ridiculous story about a group of amateur Reddit investors who beat career Wall Street hedge funds at their own game, is to be made into a movie.

According to a report by online news site Deadline on Jan. 31, Metro Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) won the rights to produce the film in a bidding war involving major Hollywood movie houses.

The movie is to be based on a book proposed by author Ben Mezrich. Mezrich’s previous work, “The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding Of Facebook, a Tale Of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal,” was adapted into the motion picture “The Social Network.”

The title to his planned latest book offering is called “The Antisocial Network,” said the report, quoting sources familiar with the development. The book is expected to go out to publishers later this February, it said.

However, it is not yet clear what shape or structure the movie will take. MGM’s Michael DeLuca will produce the film. DeLuca also produced the Academy-Award winning The Social Network. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss will executive produce via their Winklevoss Pictures production company.

The Wall Street Bets group noticed that major hedge funds on Wall Street had been placing short bets against companies they considered to be dying. The funds particularly targeted Gamestop, the world’s largest video game retailer, continually shorting the company’s shares.

But the Redditors saw an opportunity to make profit and collectively bet the other way, buying shares and stock options. This resulted in the value of the Gamestop shares soaring by more than 2,600% in January.

Hedge funds that had shorted the stock incurred losses running into several billions of dollars. One fund, Melvin Capital, reportedly lost up to $7 billion to the “short squeeze” in January, forcing it to restructure its investment portfolio to ensure a faster escape in future “squeezes.”

The Reddit traders also extended the pump to a few other stocks considered to be dying, including AMC (which climbed over 900% in January), as well as Nokia and Blackberry. This surge of activity resulted in a major controversy when the trading app Robinhood began restricting trade on certain stocks.

Alongside the cryptocurrency’s meteoric climb over the back half of 2020 and early 2021, a curious phenomenon has unfolded; heightened profit-taking and conversion to fiat currencies. Data collected by Simplex, a fiat-crypto gateway, underscores this seemingly paradoxical development.

A Curious Race to Convert Crypto to Fiat Has Accompanied Bitcoin’s Latest Drive Higher

Sharing exclusive data with Bitcoin.com, Simplex cofounder and chief analytics officer Netanel Kabala says:

While the international press coverage of Bitcoin’s rally has caused a swathe of new users to flock to the industry and buy-in, outflows have been equally significant. Of the total amount of cryptocurrency sold in the last six months, 43% was off ramped in December alone.

A quick look at Google Trends for the term ‘Bitcoin’ echoes these developments, especially now that new equity instruments like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and big-name funds like Blackrock are adding exposure and raising crypto awareness.

Still, given the increased ability to quickly convert crypto and withdraw in fiat currencies, the uptick in funds leaving the ecosystem is astonishing. Part of this can be attributed to the growing fungibility of cryptocurrency, primarily helped by the support of players like Simplex, which empowers users to buy, sell, and spend crypto through Visa partnerships.

Although some of the latest rally’s onlookers have decried the rapid rise in crypto valuations as proof that a bubble is forming in this nascent asset class, others within the industry see the development as a harbinger of times to come. One of the areas this is most apparent is altcoins.

Data compiled by Simplex illustrates that as Bitcoin prices have leveled off above $30,000, daily purchases of altcoins have risen by approximately 65%. More interestingly, the data highlights that newer users account for nearly 20% of this volume, marking a sharp increase in the number of novice retail investors expanding and diversifying their exposure within the ecosystem.

Poloniex, one of the top 20 global cryptocurrency exchanges, which has adopted Simplex’s platform, has experienced these results firsthand. Karen McHenry, Poloniex’s Director of Product, attributes this development to greater access within the ecosystem, especially with Simplex’s buy option, which promotes instant account funding alongside the heightened ability to cash out quickly.

She also doesn’t see the ability to more quickly convert from crypto to fiat as harming interest despite the eyepopping amounts taken off exchanges.

It may sound surprising, but adding the ‘sell’ option actually has a positive impact on the number of crypto transactions too.

Though this easy offramp and soaring volume of sell orders might seem negative for prices, it can also be viewed as a healthy reflection of the ecosystem’s growing use cases. Besides making it easier to exit and enter, growing areas like decentralized finance (defi) and greater fungibility all contribute to a cryptocurrency’s value proposition.

As institutions begin lining up to add exposure as retail accumulation climbs, Bitcoin momentum may actually accelerate, and by extension, lift the altcoins sought after by the newcomers seeking opportunities outside the seminal crypto coin.

McHenry adds:

If the bull market can maintain its momentum, some of these BTC profits will flow into altcoins, which are particularly popular among retail investors. This creates a positive feedback loop, with traders who turn a profit prone to telling their friends about crypto, which brings more investment into the space.

This past week, another social media trend started on the Reddit forum r/wallstreetbets, which aims to initiate a large silver short squeeze in order to push the price of the precious metal to $1,000 per ounce. However, the silver squeeze trend comes with controversy, as numerous wallstreetbets supporters believe hedge funds like Melvin Capital and Citadel are behind the silver push.

The Controversial ‘Silver Squeeze’

During the last week, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the wallstreetbets (WSB) saga taking place on social media forums and the infamous subreddit r/wallstreetbets. Since the mega short squeeze on the Gamestop (GME) shares, the squeeze maneuver has also spilled into a number of other stocks. This week, shares from the Russell 3000 Index (RUA) were targeted including tickers like NOK, GOGO, AMCX, and FIZZ. But the trend didn’t stop there, as one post, in particular, had called for a “silver squeeze.” The WSB Reddit post called for the silver squeeze to push the price of silver from $25 per ounce to $1,000.

Now since the post was published, the Reddit admins in charge of moderating r/wallstreetbets removed the post. But that was long after the message was made viral by the participants discussing the pros and cons of attempting to squeeze silver. Now the reason people think the silver short squeeze post may be shady, is because a number of WSB Redditors believe the silver squeeze was invoked by the hedge funds losing money in order to cover their GME losses. There are a great number of Reddit posts warning that people should not participate in the silver short squeeze.

One post said:

Citadel is the 5th largest owner of [silver], it’s imperative we do not ‘squeeze’ it. These are hedge fund bots spamming awards.

The people who dislike the silver trend on WSB, have also warned that Melvin Capital Management is also a big silver holder. Unfortunately, it is hard to tell where the silver pump threads and posts are stemming from, as there are many free-market supporters who are fans of the precious metal sometimes referred to as the ‘poor man’s gold.’

Despite this, there are numbers of WSB fans and Redditors claiming the silver pump stemmed from hedge fund people and they believe there are imposters everywhere now. Some of these people are growing irrational, getting mad at anyone who posts about silver. Many WSB supporters might be feeling the pain from Gamestop Corp. shares dropping significantly on Monday.

Silver soars past $30 a troy ounce as Reddit-fuelled buying frenzy continues for 3rd day. #Silversqueeze pic.twitter.com/mLmasUBrq1 — Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) February 1, 2021

In Spite of Controversy, Something Is Sparking Silver Demand

Despite the speculation, some sort of demand was invoked when it comes to silver prices and obtaining physical bullion. For instance, if you are attempting to purchase an ounce or ounces of silver bullion online, the process is far more complicated now than it was last week. A large portion of bars and coins are either sold out or the prices are marked up considerably.

This is simple arbitrage. #Silver futures are 28.67. Silver Eagles on Apmex are $41.66, thats a 45% premium to futures. Obvious opportunity to buy futures & stand for delivery for a 35% discount on physical right? But when they don't have it, Futures = $41.66/oz. #silversqueeze — Jonathan #SILVERSQUEEZE Mergott (@Jmergz1985) February 1, 2021

All the American Eagles are sold out across a number of bullion dealers. On Sunday morning, a few big-name dealers have halted a great number of silver sales. News.Bitcoin.com’s most recent WSB report disclosed how SD Bullion sold nearly 10x the number of silver ounces than usual. People visiting bullion dealer websites like Provident, Apmex, and JD Bullion could see the unprecedented demand targeting physical silver.

“In the last week, we have seen a dramatic shift in Silver demand from our customers,” said Ken Lewis CEO of the bullion dealer Apmex. “For example, the ratio of ounces sold per day was running about two times earlier in the week and closer to four times the average demand by the end of the week,” Lewis added.

The Apmex CEO further stressed:

Once markets closed on Friday, we saw demand hit as much as six times a typical business day and more than 12 times a normal weekend day. Combined with the extremely high demand levels, we are also seeing a surge in new customers. On Saturday alone, we added as many new customers as we usually add in a week.

Additionally, the hashtag “#silversqueeze” has been trending throughout the United States and a few other countries on Twitter during the last 48 hours. By the late afternoon on Sunday, spot silver and futures traded at $27 per Troy ounce, and by Monday morning spot silver traded 7.7% higher at $29.76. The commodity hopped above the $30 region, and silver prices per ounce exchanged hands at $30.35 an ounce. One ounce of .999 silver is hovering in the $29 price handle at the time of publication

CHAPTER ONE: Listening to the Past

“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.” — Satoshi Nakamoto

The trusted third party problem has haunted modern financial systems and centralized exchanges because people require an intermediary to make them work. The third party’s good or bad motives become a defining aspect of the transaction, and the those who use the institutions are at the mercy of those intentions. This is especially true of the current system of state-issued money and central banking.

A trustless system avoids intermediaries and does not depend upon the intentions of participants; that is, the system functions in the same manner regardless of anyone’s intentions. The blockchain, with a transparent and immutable peer-to peer protocol, is called trustless because there is no corruptible intermediary upon whom exchanges must depend.

On a small scale, the trusted third party problem may always exist because a middleman is useful or necessary in some situations. If third parties offer competitive services on a free market, however, the damage of dishonesty or incompetence is limited. People can take their business elsewhere, report a swindler to watchdogs, warn others, and file a lawsuit.

An occasionally dishonest third party is not the problem Satoshi addresses. He speaks to the institutionalized corruption of government and central banks from which the average person could not escape by using a competitor or by suing. Almost everyone who works over the table, runs a business, buys or sells goods, accepts government benefits or pays taxes has had to accept a fiat that constantly plunges in value due to inflation. Almost everyone who uses credit, accepts checks, takes out loans, conducts commerce or does business abroad has needed to go through banks that steal like drunken muggers.

For average people, the situation used to seem hopeless because no legal, practical, and private alternative existed for transferring funds across considerable distance, including borders. Attempts to reform or remove the system also seemed doomed because it was inherently corrupt and self-serving. In fact, fiat and central banking were serving the purpose for which they had been established: financial control by elites. People’s need for money and exchange became their straitjackets.

Then Satoshi. Then the blockchain and crypto. A new concept of money was created in a form that cannot not be inflated; the number of bitcoins is fixed at 21 million divisible units. The supply can only decrease when coins are lost, as inevitably happens. Satoshi notes, “Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.” Bitcoin solved the fiat problem.

A new concept of financial transfer solved the third party problem, especially with regard to banks. Although peer-to-peer transactions involve a middleman or miner, no trust is required since the transaction is released only when “proof of work” is rendered, which consists of solving a complicated math problem. Arriving at a solution may be costly in computer power and time, but the solutions themselves are easy to verify. Satoshi comments, “With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.” The soundness and propriety of the blockchain’s protocol itself is assured by the use of open source that is visible to all and verifiable. The political outcome: A private currency and method of exchange freed people from financial oppression.

The idea of private currency itself is hardly new, however.

Precedent in Radical Individualist Theory

The late Friedrich Hayek is the most respected Austrian economist of the 20th century. His book The Denationalisation of Money: An Analysis of the Theory and Practice of Concurrent Currencies argues vigorously for private and competitive currencies to displace government-issued ones. Hayek ponders a key question. “When one studies the history of money one cannot help wondering why people should have put up for so long with governments exercising an exclusive power over two thousand years that was regularly used to exploit and defraud them. This can be explained only by the myth” that government money was necessary “becoming so firmly established that it did not occur even to the professional students of these matters…ever to question it. But once the validity of the established doctrine is doubted its foundation is rapidly seen to be fragile.”

Governments reap incredible profits from debasing the currency, but the rigged game works only if people have no alternative but to play it. The political purpose of legal tender and banking laws is to grant a monopoly to the state, which permits the redistribution of wealth and power from average people upward to the elite of society. Fiat money and banking remains fragile, however, because the system relies on people either not understanding the dynamics or not having a choice. Hayek wonders why public understanding is so elusive. Why was “a government monopoly of the provision of money…universally regarded as indispensable” and what would happen “if the provision of money were thrown open to the competition of private concerns supplying different currencies?”

With eerie prescience, Hayek argues for currencies developed by entrepreneurs who innovate new forms of money just as they innovate in other areas. One of the drawbacks of government’s monopoly is that it imposes a freeze on the sort of invention that now runs free in crypto. The voluntaryist historian Carl Watner observes, “No one can tell in advance what form these monies might take because no one can know for sure what choices individuals would make or what new technologies might be discovered. Laws forcing people to use the Federal Reserve System money have frozen monetary developments at a certain stage…Just imagine if Congress had protected the Post Office by passing laws that would have prevented people from communicating via the internet. We would never have experienced the marvels of e-mail.”

The late Austrian economist Murray Rothbard also wrestles with the question of “why do people so vigorously resist private currencies?” His book For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto advances an explanation. “If the government and only the government had had a monopoly of the shoe manufacturing and retailing business, how would most of the public treat the libertarian who now came along to advocate that the government get out of the shoe business and throw it open to private enterprise?” Rothbard predicts that the skeptics would attack the libertarian for depriving them of the only possible source of shoes—the government. People are thoroughly indoctrinated to believe that daily life cannot function without the state and fiat.

Hayek and Rothbard are unusual among free-market economists in their embrace of private money and monetary systems. Even laissez-faire zealots rarely champion free-market currencies or private banking. Instead, they debate marginal issues such as fractional reserve and other reforms they think will improve the existing system. Or they argue for the restoration of a gold standard as though it were a panacea. But if a gold standard were applied to fiat, the system would still require people to trust the government and banks. This means trusting both institutions to act against their own interests, which they have historically neglected to do.

The modern neglect of free-market money and banking is odd because 19th century radical individualists focused intensely on the importance of private money and private banking to personal freedom. They placed a primal emphasis on the right of every individual to create his own currency and to function as his own bank. It was a natural right as important as freedom of speech or of religion. The pivotal individualist Benjamin Tucker believed that the right to issue private currency was so important that it could destroy the State all by itself. His reasoning: The money monopoly, including control of credit, was how the State sustained itself and robbed average people not merely of wealth but also of economic opportunity.

Two specific events sculpted the approach that the early individualist-anarchists adopted toward the monetary monopoly. One was the Panic of 1837 that tipped the United States into recession until the mid-1840s. Commonly cited causes of the Panic include a collapsing land bubble and a sharp fall in cotton prices. Blame is also placed at the feet of President Andrew Jackson for vetoing the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States and precipitating an unfortunate chain of economic events. Drawing on the work of Professor of Economics Peter Temin, Rothbard disputes this interpretation.

First, he [Temin] points out that the price inflation really began earlier, when wholesale prices reached a trough of 82 in July 1830 and then rose by 20.7 percent in three years to reach 99 in the fall of 1833. The reason for the price rise is simple: The total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $159 million in 1833, an increase of 45.9 percent, or an annual rise of 15.3 percent. Breaking the figures down further, the total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $155 million a year and a half later, a spectacular expansion of 35 percent. Unquestionably, this monetary expansion was spurred by the still-flourishing Bank of the United States, which increased its notes and deposits from January 1830 to January 1832 from a total of $29 million to $42.1 million, a rise of 45.2 percent. Thus, the price and money inflation in the first few years of the 1830s were again sparked by the expansion of the still-dominant central bank.

Arguably, the Panic began in May 1837 when banks in New York City announced they would not redeem commercial paper for specie at full face value. Of the approximately 800 banks in America, all but six ceased at one point or another to redeem banknotes and deposits for gold or silver coins. Suspicion and hatred of traditional banks and government-issued money soared, with radicals scrutinizing alternate systems.

The other event dramatically to impact the radical fever from monetary reform was the Civil War for which the North financed its fighting through Legal Tender Acts and the National Banking Act of 1863.

The radicals did not merely theorize; they experimented with private currencies and new economic models. Their efforts are fascinating, but they are also cautionary tales. A major problem for 19th-century individualist-anarchism was the movement’s general acceptance of a link between sound money and the labor theory of value. This theory states that the true value of a good or service is based on the labor required to produce it rather than the price at which a seller and buyer are willing to exchange. In short, a good has intrinsic and not subjective value. (More on this in the section on the Regression Theorem.) Happily, their main economic goal was the abolition of the “money monopoly.” The term referred to three different but interacting forms of monopoly: banking, the charging of interest, and the privileged issuance of currency. The abolition of state power over currency was the focus, and they eschewed the use of force to implement their own schemes.

Josiah Warren provided a real-world example of what was meant by a currency that rested on the labor theory of value. Credited with being the first American anarchist, Warren tested his specific solution to the money monopoly through a Time Store from which he issued “Labor Notes.” In 1827, the business opened with $300 worth of groceries and dry goods that were offered at a 7 percent markup from Warren’s own costs in order to cover expenses such as overhead. This was before groceries were prepackaged or preweighed, and it was usual for buyers to bargain with the shopkeeper rather than pay a posted price. One of

Warren’s innovations was to post prices, which drove costs lower because transactions consumed less time. The customer paid in traditional money for the goods and paid with a Labor Note to compensate Warren for his time. The Labor Note obliged the customer to provide Warren with an equivalent amount of his time. If the buyer was a seamstress, for example, the Labor Note committed her to render to Warren X units of time to produce clothing. Warren’s goal was to establish an economy—or to establish a proof of principle, at least—in which profit was based on the exchange of time and labor. The Labor Notes were circulated and traded widely with in the community.

To some degree, Warren succeeded. People traveled from a hundred miles away to avail themselves of the Time Store’s low prices. After a few years, he declared the experiment to be a success and closed the store. Whether the Labor Notes were a success is questionable, however. The store itself may well have succeeded due to its low prices, not to the Notes. Whichever explanation is true, it is difficult to see how this novel currency could function in dense populations or on a grander scale of commerce. Few people today would be convinced of the viability of private money based on the Time Store experiment.

What could convince the public and economists that private currencies work as well or better than government-issued ones? Going back a bit further in American history is a good place to start because the future is always based on the past.

Hayek and Rothbard are unusual among free-market economists in their embrace of private money and monetary systems.
The modern neglect of free-market money and banking is odd because 19th century radical individualists focused intensely on the importance of private money and private banking to personal freedom.

21Shares AG, a Zurich-based investment provider, is launching what is being dubbed as the world’s first Polkadot exchange-traded product, or ETP.

The DOT ETP will be listed on the Swiss exchange SIX on Thursday, February 4, said the company in a statement on Tuesday. DOT is the native token of the Polkadot network.

DOT has since been added to 21Shares’ Crypto Basket ETP (HODL), which tracks five major assets including bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH). Since its addition on Jan. 29, DOT now accounts for 27% of the product behind BTC at 50%.

Hany Rashwan, chief executive officer of 21Shares, said the firm has seen “unprecedented demand” from institutional investors wanting exposure to crypto-assets. He stated that demand for its range of crypto ETPs has soared 500% since the third quarter of 2020, but there has been “a recent surge in interest” for DOT.

“After investors purchase their first bitcoins through our ETPs, there is a natural transition to invest in other crypto assets,” Rashwan detailed.

“We benefit from trusted partners for the liquidity provision and upon continued institutional demand, we are launching the DOT ETP to give investors a safe, regulated, and easy way to obtain exposure to this exciting new blockchain technology,” he added.

Rashwan revealed that 21Shares, an issuer of exchange-traded products, is planning to add up to three ETPs over the next 3 months. He said European investors have been approaching the company to launch new products.

Created by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Polkadot is a cross-blockchain that enables transfers of any type of data or asset, not just tokens. It is also used as an electronic payment system.

DOT is now the world’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market capitalization of $16.55 billion, according to data from markets.Bitcoin.com. At the time of writing, DOT is trading at $17.22, up 8% over the past 24 hours.

Ukraine’s government-owned nuclear power plant picked a firm to build a massive data center in Rivne for cryptocurrency mining operations. After a bidding process, Energoatom chose Kyiv Energy Construction Company to handle the nuclear plant crypto mining project.

Nuclear Power Plant Operator Expects to Launch the Data Center in 2022

According to official documents, the data center will be based in the Rivne nuclear power plant, after the construction firm got 8.92 million Hryvnia ($317,620) in funding. The only competitor in the bidding was Ukrenergobudproek. However, they allegedly made an expensive offer, said the regional news outlet Forklog.

The Kyiv Energy Construction Company expects to finish the data center building by August 31, 2022. Per the announcement, the contractor is required to send the documentation that details the whole process. It includes “host state registers, electronic archives, and computing facilities.”

In terms of technical details, the nuclear power plant has a capacity of 2,657 megawatts, and it was built in the late 1970s. Also, the operations of the state-owned nuclear facilities started at the beginning of 1980.

In October 2020, Energoatom also signed a memorandum with a subsidiary of crypto mining giant Bitfury. With the new data center, local media outlets believe Bitfury miners could move their operations into the power plant’s facilities.

Ukraine’s Interest Towards Building Crypto Mining Data Centers in Nuclear Plants

The deal between Energoatom and Kyiv Energy Construction Company is not a surprising move. In fact, the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine asked Energoatom in May 2020 to conduct research to assess crypto mining’s feasibility at their nuclear plants.

As an anecdotal fact in terms of crypto mining in Ukrainian nuclear plants, the nation’s Security Service found illegal crypto mining equipment in a nuclear power plant in 2019.

The installation’s illegal mining rigs were found in the Southern region of Ukraine. Moreover, the investigations determined that such illegal equipment breached a “state secret.”

Global music distribution service Ditto has unveiled the latest addition to its service lineup for musicians with a blockchain-based financing platform named Opulous.

Opulous Peer-to-Peer Lending Platform Serves as a Loan Pool Designed to Help Artists

Ditto continues its efforts to improve the value chain for artists. Unlike other decentralized finance (defi) protocols, Opulous reflects asset-based lending, which bridges the physical and digital worlds. The Opulous’ defi lending mechanism, which is being developed on the Algorand public blockchain, leverages music copyrights’ tangibility through a smart contract setup that automatically handles principal and interest payments along with distributions to investors.

For musicians already receiving royalties, this presents a unique opportunity to monetize their assets or contribute to the pool to stake other artists. When seeking capital, artists can access funds by collateralizing loans from Opulous’ Music Copyright Pools with their music royalties.

Besides digitizing music as an asset class, the move will invite more democratized participation from artists and investors seeking to gain a foothold in the music industry, which is undergoing tremendous annual growth and expected to double in size by 2030. Artists benefit from interest rates starting as low as 4%, while investors in the copyright pools can add exposure to music royalties as an asset class for 10% returns per annum.

Per Ditto CEO Lee Parsons,

Opulous cuts out traditional banking, providing musicians with a platform with minimal interest payments, while giving investors the chance to stake a claim in one of the most exciting and fastest-growing financial industries in the world.

Ditto, which has already processed more than $1 billion in royalties for its 250,000-plus users, sees industry revenues doubling in the next ten years, building a compelling investment thesis. In keeping with Opulous’ mission to democratize musicians’ financial access, users outside the Ditto ecosystem are welcome to join the peer-to-peer lending framework.

Opulous has raised $1.5 million in funding to-date from BASIC, Borderless Capital, Kosmos Capital, Somesing, and TrustVerse. Roll out of the platform’s minimum viable product (MVP) is anticipated in two months as development proceeds.

Elastos, which built its decentralized application (dapp) platform and currency (ELA) to protect users’ digital assets and creations, will be among the first token staking partners for Opulous’ proof-of-stake consensus protocol. Opulous, in concert with Elastos, will allow investors to stake their Elastos (ELA) coins within the Music Copyright Pools.

According to Clarence Liu, the VP of Development at the Elastos Foundation,

Elastos and Ditto Music have been researching how blockchain can address fundamental inefficiencies in the music industry. Access to funding – which Opulous will address – is only the tip of the iceberg.

“Our collaboration has much more in the pipeline and our community is definitely set on using the forward momentum sparked by recent world events to introduce new users to the decentralized internet ideals set by Elastos,” Liu concludes.

During the last year, Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem has grown exponentially to form a multi Billion Dollar market. As Decentralized Finance expands, it becomes more and more relevant to have cross-chain connections that enable crypto assets to flow instantly and seamlessly across blockchain networks. These make it possible for DeFi platforms to be an effective alternative to centralized exchanges. Today, pNetwork launches the first EOS to Ethereum cross-chain connection to enable the EOS crypto asset to be moved into Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem.

EOS on Ethereum

EOS, the native token on the EOS blockchain, is a top20 cryptocurrency by market cap and the engine powering one of the most active dApps ecosystems. The asset counts over $ 3.5 Billion in daily trading volumes, figuring as the 9th most traded cryptocurrency. At present, only a fraction of the total is happening in a decentralized fashion.

While the DeFi ecosystem on EOS continues to grow, it has not yet reached Ethereum’s size. The latter powers Billions in daily trading volumes, Uniswap being the largestlarges liquidity protocol in existence and the fourth biggest DeFi protocol in terms of Total Value Locked.

Following the delivery of 26 bridges connecting six different blockchain protocols, including the cross-chain transfer of popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin, pNetwork launches today a new cross-chain connection that brings EOS to Ethereum.

As the first tokenised version of EOS, pEOS makes the asset compatible with Ethereum’s DeFi. This creates a benefit on both sides, enabling Ethereum’s DeFi protocols to expand their range of assets supported and granting EOS the option to be traded in a decentralized fashion as well as being supported as a collateral type by major Ethereum-based landing platforms.

Cross-chain connections are critical for a variety of use-cases, from NFTs to market making to decentralized indexes such as PieDAO’s Pies. pNetwork-powered asset tokenisation on Ethereum enables such indexes to represent the entire crypto market.

All pTokenised assets are pegged 1:1 to their underlying asset and are available for automated minting or redeeming on the pTokens dApp. In addition, pTokens are supported on a variety of DeFi protocols, decentralized exchanges and wallets on a growing number of blockchains.

Making Ethereum and EOS dApps Interoperable

Ethereum and EOS are two of the most active ecosystems for dApps, counting thousands of users each. By connecting these two blockchain environments, pNetwork aims to support the growth and development of decentralized applications such as lending/borrowing, trading, derivatives, and more. Acting as a cross-chain highway for cryptocurrencies to frictionlessly move from one blockchain to another, pNetwork powers the first bi-directional connection between the Ethereum and EOS blockchains.

Users on either blockchain are now able to interact with both ecosystems without ever leaving their blockchain of choice. Projects from both Ethereum and EOS communities have developed building blocks to create the next-generation financial system – with the connection between these two, users will find an even more powerful DeFi ecosystem.

By leveraging pNetwork’s cross-chain solution, dApps on the two blockchain platforms now have the opportunity to interoperate. Each ecosystem leveraging its counterpart’s strengths ultimately creates a benefit on both sides and sets the basis for sustainable growth. The presence of an EOS/ETH decentralized trading pair both with Ethereum’s and EOS’s decentralized finance, for example, makes it possible for market makers to arbitrage between the two blockchains. This results in a more liquid decentralized market for both assets.

Michael Rubinov, president of Kronos Advanced Technologies, commented on the company’s stance towards cryptocurrencies:

In the last ten years, much has been said about how cryptocurrency will revolutionize payments, services, businesses and will change the world the way we know it. Cryptocurrency has changed e-commerce: as more and more people now shop online. Cryptocurrency gives customers more reasons to utilize the convenience of online shopping, as it mitigates the risk of fraud for both vendors and shoppers.

By adopting dogecoin as a form of payment, Kronos also expect to market N95 masks to the entire meme coin community on Reddit, which has grown over 670,000 members. The company also praised the fact that Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk endorses dogecoin as one of his favorite cryptocurrencies.

Spacex and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been trying to get to the bottom of what happened with the popular trading app Robinhood when it stopped people from buying shares of hot stocks, like Gamestop. The shares of these stocks became popular due to the Wallstreetbets movement.

Elon Musk Says People Want the Truth From Robinhood

During an interview on The Good Time Show via the Clubhouse app Sunday night, Elon Musk grilled the CEO of trading app Robinhood, Vlad Tenev, over the company’s decision to restrict hot stocks last week, including Gamestop. On Friday, Robinhood also restricted crypto trading, citing “extraordinary market conditions.”

“What happened last week? Why can’t people buy the Gamestop shares? The people demand an answer and they want to know the details and the truth,” Musk said.

Tenev began by explaining the structure of his company. “Robinhood is actually a couple of companies,” he described. Robinhood Financial processes trades, Robinhood Securities clears and settles the trades, and Robinhood Crypto which deals with crypto trades.

The Robinhood CEO detailed that last Wednesday, his platform experienced “unprecedented volume” as “a lot of these so-called meme stocks were going viral on social media and people were joining Robinhood” to buy these stocks. Consequently, the company “received a file” from the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) Thursday morning at about 3:30 AM PST. It requested Robinhood to “put up money to the NSCC based on some factors,” including the volatility of certain securities. Tenev clarified that “this is the equities business so it’s based on stock trading and not options trading or anything else,” elaborating:

They gave us a file with a deposit and the request was around $3 billion dollars which is about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is.

Musk interrupted Tenev, questioning: “Why is that so high? It sounds like this is an unprecedented increase in demand for capital. What formula did they use to calculate that?”

Tenev replied: “We don’t have the full details. It’s a little bit of an opaque formula but there’s a component called the VAR of it, which is the Value at Risk, and that’s based on kind of some fairly quantitative things … and then there’s a special component which is discretionary so that kind of acts as a multiplier.” Tenev also noted that up until that point, his company “has raised a little bit around two billion dollars in total venture capital,” so the request was “a big number.”

The Tesla CEO interrupted again, asking: “What everyone wants to know is did something maybe shady go down here? It seems weird that you’d get a sudden $10 billion demand in the morning … suddenly out of nowhere.” Tenev swiftly corrected Musk that the number was $3 billion. The Robinhood CEO then emphasized:

I wouldn’t impugn shadiness to it or anything like that, and actually the NSCC was reasonable subsequent to this. They worked with us to actually lower it. It was unprecedented activity.

Musk abruptly asked Tenev: “Is there anyone holding you hostage right now?” Tenev chuckled and replied: “No, no, I’m okay. Thanks for asking.” Both laughed.

The Robinhood CEO proceeded to explain what happened, calling the experience “nerve-wrecking.” He said after receiving the request for $3 billion, his chief operating officer called up someone higher up at the NSCC to discuss what to do. “There was another call and they lowered it to something like $1.4 billion from $3 billion,” Tenev reiterated that it was still a high number. His company then proposed a plan to the NSCC of “marking these volatile stocks that were kind of driving the activity position-closing only.”

Then, at about 5 to 5:30 AM PST, before the market opened, the NSCC came back and reduced the deposit requirement to $700 million, “which we then deposited and paid promptly,” Tenev emphasized. Acknowledging that the move was bad for customers, the Robinhood CEO said, “We had no choice, in this case. We had to conform to our regulatory capital requirements and so the team did what they could to make sure we were available for customers.”

The Spacex CEO further questioned: “Who controls this organization, this clearinghouse?” Tenev replied: “It’s a consortium. It’s not quite a government agency. I don’t really know the details of all of that.” Nonetheless, he emphasized that “To be fair … I think there was legitimate sort of turmoil in the markets … so there probably is some amount of extra risk in the system that warrants higher requirements so it’s not entirely unreasonable.” He noted that lots of other brokers were in the same situation and had to restrict the same activity.

“So it sounds like this organization calls you up and they basically have a gun to your head: either hand over this money or else,” the Spacex CEO summarized, elaborating:

Basically, what people are wondering is did you sell your clients down the river or did you have no choice. If you had no choice, that’s understandable but then we got to find out why you had no choice and who are these people that are saying you have no choice.

“I think that’s fair. We have to comply with these requirements. Financial institutions have requirements,” Tenev responded. Nonetheless, he suggested that it would be helpful to know the formula the NSCC uses to calculate these requirements so companies can plan better.

Musk proceeded to ask about whether there was outside pressure forcing Robinhood to take the action it did. Tenev affirmed that there is “a rumor that Citadel or other market makers kind of pressured us into doing this.” However, he clarified, “that’s just false,” emphasizing that “this was a clearinghouse decision and it was just based on the capital requirements so from our perspective Citadel and other market makers weren’t involved in that.”

During the same Clubhouse interview, Elon also revealed that he is a supporter of bitcoin and should have bought the cryptocurrency eight years ago. He believes that bitcoin is on the verge of getting broad acceptance by traditional finance people. On Monday, Robinhood raised another $2.4 billion from shareholders after it secured $1 billion last Thursday.

PRESS RELEASE. The AdGram service was founded a year ago and is currently the largest advertising exchange in Telegram.

AdGram helps brands place large advertising volumes in channels and groups quickly and efficiently. Channels and groups benefit from expansion of their audience, it is easy to find advertisers and increase the earnings from advertising placements via AdGram.

Over the last 12 months, the service has gained a huge experience in communications with both advertisers and administrators from different countries, which has highlighted issues with settlements in multiple currencies. After overcoming these obstacles, it was decided that cryptocurrency could be the key to solving this problem.

With the termination of the Telegram team’s work on the TON project in May 2020 (the messenger lost one of its monetization methods), Free TON was launched which took over the development and popularization of TON Crystal using the open source code from the original TON. The uniqueness of FreeTON is that it is one of the few projects where all the tokens belong to the community and it is developing as a decentralized autonomous organization.

The potential of the underlying technology and the growth of the community inspired AdGram and in October 2020 they partnered with the FreeTON Community and fully integrated Crystal as a means of payment. Synergy with FreeTON made it possible to take a big step towards using cryptocurrencies as a single, simple and clear means of payment.

The ability to pay with tokens for advertising in Telegram creates a powerful use case for the TON Crystal token. Huge and constantly growing volume of the advertising market is vital for tokenomics as it creates supply and demand for market participants, thereby increasing the liquidity of the token itself.

For administrators and advertisers transactions in TON Crystal is simple, convenient and fast! It also solves the problem of collecting details for transfers in various currencies, and avoids paying banking fees.

Advertising on Telegram and the FreeTON blockchain, which is the successor of Durov’s original (but never happened Durov’s TON), create a strong and impact-resistant synergy of mutual benefits. This shows markets and communities can develop in a self-regulated environment.

PRESS RELEASE. CEX.IO LOAN experiences massive institutional demand for its crypto-backed lending service, with 41% of customers requesting to borrow cash against Bitcoin, 53% against Ethereum, and 6% against DeFi tokens.

Crypto-backed lending service CEX.IO LOAN that launched in October 2020 in select global jurisdictions, has been experiencing major demand, receiving over $100 million worth of loan requests to date. While the service has been widely popular among retail investors, most of the platform’s loan requests came from institutional investors.

According to CEX.IO LOAN, such an increase in demand can be attributed to the institutionalization of the cryptocurrency industry. Institutional investors, who have cryptocurrencies in their possession, regard it as a potential collateral for borrowing funds and actively utilise it as such. The borrowed funds are then used for further investment purposes.

In addition to featuring cutting-edge security and advanced anti-fraud measures, CEX.IO Group operates a regulated service, which has been licensed as a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) provider by the Gibraltar Financial Service Commission (GFSC) since last year. In addition to this, the Government of Gibraltar recently granted CEX.IO Limited a Money Lender License, allowing the firm to extend its ecosystem of regulated services with CEX.IO LOAN.

Institutional clients also prefer the company’s digital asset-backed lending service due to the convenience offered to users. On the CEX.IO LOAN platform, customers can borrow cash against their cryptocurrency assets in a quick and simple manner, without having to deal with credit checks or any unnecessary paperwork. To access the company’s instant crypto-backed lending service, new users have to open an account at the digital asset exchange and pass the mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML checks.

CEX.IO LOAN serves various cryptocurrency market participants, from retail investors, traders, and HODLers to startups, entrepreneurs, and large enterprises. As part of a flexible crypto-backed lending service, users can borrow any amount between $500 and $100,000 at competitive interest rates starting at 8.75% per year. Loan duration ranging from seven days to one year.

Currently, retail users can borrow funds against their Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) assets. Based on the company’s data, the feature has already experienced high demand from VIP clients, with 41% of all CEX.IO LOAN customers borrowing cash against Bitcoin (BTC), 53% against Ethereum (ETH), and 6% against DeFi tokens.

The company has recently introduced a VIP-exclusive feature to offer flexible lending conditions and the ability to use decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens as collateral for institutional clients on the crypto-backed lending platform.

Furthermore, to best serve institutional customers, the requests and queries of VIP clients are handled individually by dedicated personal managers on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Interestingly, 14% of CEX.IO VIP customers have already asked their personal managers about borrowing funds via the crypto-backed lending service.

“As institutional investors find the digital asset industry increasingly attractive, it’s a pleasure to serve them with our enterprise-grade instant crypto-backed loan platform. Security, convenience, and compliance are key priorities for corporate clients, which are features that we have been providing to all our clients in the rapidly growing CEX.IO ecosystem. Most importantly, we want to provide institutional clients with the best service. For that reason, VIP clients enjoy exclusive benefits, such as dedicated personal managers and flexible lending options, on the CEX.IO LOAN platform,” Anton Chashchin, Commercial Director for the CEX.IO LOAN service, stated.

In the announcement, the firm revealed further details about the size of the funds clients borrow on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Based on the company’s data, while retail investors borrow $1,400 on average, VIP clients request larger-sized loans that vary in size, with the typical amount being $1 million or higher.

Institutional clients do not just borrow more but also need the funds for more extended periods which usually range between 6 and 12 months. According to the company, this phenomenon indicates a long-term strategy for VIP clients to manage their assets.

PRESS RELEASE. PARSIQ, a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform connecting on-chain and off-chain applications in real-time, announced that its PRQ token is now listed on OKEx with USDT base pair.

Please take note of the following go-live schedule:

PRQ Deposit : 07:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Spot Trading : PRQ / USDT : 10:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Withdrawal : 10:00 January 29, 2021 (UTC)

PARSIQ is a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform that serves as a multi-level bridge between blockchains and off-chain applications. PARSIQ’s features automate the blockchain analytics and monitoring process, providing customizable workflows with real-time intelligence.

Developers and individual users can transform the blockchain data to their favorite off-chain application or web service.

Among the obvious use cases is monitoring the wallets of traders and ordinary users. Among the non-obvious are complex system integrations for financial institutions and DeFi projects that use the PARSIQ infrastructure to improve security, conduct audits, comply with regulatory requirements, AML, and expand their workflows in other ways.

The infrastructure underneath PARSIQ’s user interface is built with their proprietary programming language ParsiQL, and its users’ benefits are multiplying with each supported integration.

PRQ Token

PARSIQ Token (PRQ) is an essential piece of the PARSIQ platform that co-exists with FIAT payments for using its services. Payments within the platform that are made in PRQ tokens guarantee a discounted rate. During the first Epoch when PRQ tokens are used as payment for running Smart-Triggers users receive higher execution limits, unlock transport methods, and are able to propose features that can be added to the platform.

In October 2020, the PARSIQ team released plans for Epoch 2.0.

#1. Public Projects

With Public Projects users can subscribe to existing PARSIQ Projects that were pre-made by other users. By paying in PRQ, users that have subscribed to the Public Project will incentivize the creators to create interesting, complex, and more important – problem-solving projects.

#2. User Data and PRQ

Every single monitoring target (primitive of type address, a struct with the field of address type, table row) would require 1 PRQ to hold after the implementation. It means that if there are 1000 addresses (960 in the table as rows, 30 as primitives, 10 in the structs) then the User would need 1000 PRQ on the connected Ethereum Account balance.

#3. IQ Protocol

IQ Protocol will allow risk-free PRQ lending and collateral-less borrowing. Risk-free PRQ lending means that PRQ is not transferred from the lender’s address to the borrower’s address. Details on the algorithm are available in the dedicated explainer on PARSIQ’s blog.

#4. PRQBoost

PRQ Boost is a liquidity boost program to incentivize PRQ/ETH liquidity providers on Uniswap, which goes with the PRQBOOST utility tokens to increase rewards for liquidity providers.

PARSIQ is actively working to partner with major layer 1 blockchain protocols to expand the range of blockchain integrations and give projects that build on those protocols the ability to monitor and automate workflows between blockchain and off-chain.

PRESS RELEASE. YFX, the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts has just launched, adding an important piece to the DeFi money legos, and creating a direct competition against CEX on derivatives trading.

The most traded Bitcoin product in centralized exchanges is Bitcoin futures, which is 10 times bigger than spot trading in terms of the trading volume. But in DEX, spot trading platforms like Uniswap are occupying a large portion of the total trading volume, and there is not a single decentralized futures trading platform that could reach even 1/10 of Uniswap’s trading volume. What stops decentralized futures trading platforms from becoming 10 times bigger than Uniswap? Why are decentralized futures trading platforms performing worse than their centralized counterparts?

The main reason is that decentralized futures exchanges don’t currently provide an attractive futures product to compete with centralized futures exchanges. For instance, centralized futures exchanges like BitMex can provide 100x leverage on Bitcoin futures trading. On the other hand, decentralized futures exchanges like dYdX only offer 10x leverage. None of the decentralized exchanges can keep up with the 100x leverage offering from centralized exchanges.

YFX Descartes V1 uses QIC-AMM and a system de-risk mechanism to migrate perpetual futures trading from CEX to DEX without reducing the trading leverage, which makes YFX the first DEX that could offer 100x leverage on a perpetual contract. You can do everything on YFX that you can do on BitMex or OKEx. YFX is poised to compete directly against established centralized exchanges. YFX Descartes V1 runs on the TRON MainNet, for faster transaction times and cheaper gas fees compared to Ethereum. The YFX team is also working on Ethereum’s Layer 2 solution to provide pragmatic perpetual trading on DEX. YFX team plans to launch their DEX on Huobi Heco and Ethereum Test net in Q1, 2021.

About YFX

YFX is the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts. YFX Descartes V1 launched on the TRON MainNet, and all trades are held and processed by smart contracts. The main goal of the YFX team, which is formed by a group of engineers who have years of experience working on trading systems and blockchain, is to build a DEX that can compete with CEX on derivative trading.

The Wall Street Bets saga, an incredibly ridiculous story about a group of amateur Reddit investors who beat career Wall Street hedge funds at their own game, is to be made into a movie.

According to a report by online news site Deadline on Jan. 31, Metro Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) won the rights to produce the film in a bidding war involving major Hollywood movie houses.

The movie is to be based on a book proposed by author Ben Mezrich. Mezrich’s previous work, “The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding Of Facebook, a Tale Of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal,” was adapted into the motion picture “The Social Network.”

The title to his planned latest book offering is called “The Antisocial Network,” said the report, quoting sources familiar with the development. The book is expected to go out to publishers later this February, it said.

However, it is not yet clear what shape or structure the movie will take. MGM’s Michael DeLuca will produce the film. DeLuca also produced the Academy-Award winning The Social Network. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss will executive produce via their Winklevoss Pictures production company.

The Wall Street Bets group noticed that major hedge funds on Wall Street had been placing short bets against companies they considered to be dying. The funds particularly targeted Gamestop, the world’s largest video game retailer, continually shorting the company’s shares.

But the Redditors saw an opportunity to make profit and collectively bet the other way, buying shares and stock options. This resulted in the value of the Gamestop shares soaring by more than 2,600% in January.

Hedge funds that had shorted the stock incurred losses running into several billions of dollars. One fund, Melvin Capital, reportedly lost up to $7 billion to the “short squeeze” in January, forcing it to restructure its investment portfolio to ensure a faster escape in future “squeezes.”

The Reddit traders also extended the pump to a few other stocks considered to be dying, including AMC (which climbed over 900% in January), as well as Nokia and Blackberry. This surge of activity resulted in a major controversy when the trading app Robinhood began restricting trade on certain stocks.

Alongside the cryptocurrency’s meteoric climb over the back half of 2020 and early 2021, a curious phenomenon has unfolded; heightened profit-taking and conversion to fiat currencies. Data collected by Simplex, a fiat-crypto gateway, underscores this seemingly paradoxical development.

A Curious Race to Convert Crypto to Fiat Has Accompanied Bitcoin’s Latest Drive Higher

Sharing exclusive data with Bitcoin.com, Simplex cofounder and chief analytics officer Netanel Kabala says:

While the international press coverage of Bitcoin’s rally has caused a swathe of new users to flock to the industry and buy-in, outflows have been equally significant. Of the total amount of cryptocurrency sold in the last six months, 43% was off ramped in December alone.

A quick look at Google Trends for the term ‘Bitcoin’ echoes these developments, especially now that new equity instruments like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and big-name funds like Blackrock are adding exposure and raising crypto awareness.

Still, given the increased ability to quickly convert crypto and withdraw in fiat currencies, the uptick in funds leaving the ecosystem is astonishing. Part of this can be attributed to the growing fungibility of cryptocurrency, primarily helped by the support of players like Simplex, which empowers users to buy, sell, and spend crypto through Visa partnerships.

Although some of the latest rally’s onlookers have decried the rapid rise in crypto valuations as proof that a bubble is forming in this nascent asset class, others within the industry see the development as a harbinger of times to come. One of the areas this is most apparent is altcoins.

Data compiled by Simplex illustrates that as Bitcoin prices have leveled off above $30,000, daily purchases of altcoins have risen by approximately 65%. More interestingly, the data highlights that newer users account for nearly 20% of this volume, marking a sharp increase in the number of novice retail investors expanding and diversifying their exposure within the ecosystem.

Poloniex, one of the top 20 global cryptocurrency exchanges, which has adopted Simplex’s platform, has experienced these results firsthand. Karen McHenry, Poloniex’s Director of Product, attributes this development to greater access within the ecosystem, especially with Simplex’s buy option, which promotes instant account funding alongside the heightened ability to cash out quickly.

She also doesn’t see the ability to more quickly convert from crypto to fiat as harming interest despite the eyepopping amounts taken off exchanges.

It may sound surprising, but adding the ‘sell’ option actually has a positive impact on the number of crypto transactions too.

Though this easy offramp and soaring volume of sell orders might seem negative for prices, it can also be viewed as a healthy reflection of the ecosystem’s growing use cases. Besides making it easier to exit and enter, growing areas like decentralized finance (defi) and greater fungibility all contribute to a cryptocurrency’s value proposition.

As institutions begin lining up to add exposure as retail accumulation climbs, Bitcoin momentum may actually accelerate, and by extension, lift the altcoins sought after by the newcomers seeking opportunities outside the seminal crypto coin.

McHenry adds:

If the bull market can maintain its momentum, some of these BTC profits will flow into altcoins, which are particularly popular among retail investors. This creates a positive feedback loop, with traders who turn a profit prone to telling their friends about crypto, which brings more investment into the space.

This past week, another social media trend started on the Reddit forum r/wallstreetbets, which aims to initiate a large silver short squeeze in order to push the price of the precious metal to $1,000 per ounce. However, the silver squeeze trend comes with controversy, as numerous wallstreetbets supporters believe hedge funds like Melvin Capital and Citadel are behind the silver push.

The Controversial ‘Silver Squeeze’

During the last week, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the wallstreetbets (WSB) saga taking place on social media forums and the infamous subreddit r/wallstreetbets. Since the mega short squeeze on the Gamestop (GME) shares, the squeeze maneuver has also spilled into a number of other stocks. This week, shares from the Russell 3000 Index (RUA) were targeted including tickers like NOK, GOGO, AMCX, and FIZZ. But the trend didn’t stop there, as one post, in particular, had called for a “silver squeeze.” The WSB Reddit post called for the silver squeeze to push the price of silver from $25 per ounce to $1,000.

Now since the post was published, the Reddit admins in charge of moderating r/wallstreetbets removed the post. But that was long after the message was made viral by the participants discussing the pros and cons of attempting to squeeze silver. Now the reason people think the silver short squeeze post may be shady, is because a number of WSB Redditors believe the silver squeeze was invoked by the hedge funds losing money in order to cover their GME losses. There are a great number of Reddit posts warning that people should not participate in the silver short squeeze.

One post said:

Citadel is the 5th largest owner of [silver], it’s imperative we do not ‘squeeze’ it. These are hedge fund bots spamming awards.

The people who dislike the silver trend on WSB, have also warned that Melvin Capital Management is also a big silver holder. Unfortunately, it is hard to tell where the silver pump threads and posts are stemming from, as there are many free-market supporters who are fans of the precious metal sometimes referred to as the ‘poor man’s gold.’

Despite this, there are numbers of WSB fans and Redditors claiming the silver pump stemmed from hedge fund people and they believe there are imposters everywhere now. Some of these people are growing irrational, getting mad at anyone who posts about silver. Many WSB supporters might be feeling the pain from Gamestop Corp. shares dropping significantly on Monday.

Silver soars past $30 a troy ounce as Reddit-fuelled buying frenzy continues for 3rd day. #Silversqueeze pic.twitter.com/mLmasUBrq1 — Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) February 1, 2021

In Spite of Controversy, Something Is Sparking Silver Demand

Despite the speculation, some sort of demand was invoked when it comes to silver prices and obtaining physical bullion. For instance, if you are attempting to purchase an ounce or ounces of silver bullion online, the process is far more complicated now than it was last week. A large portion of bars and coins are either sold out or the prices are marked up considerably.

This is simple arbitrage. #Silver futures are 28.67. Silver Eagles on Apmex are $41.66, thats a 45% premium to futures. Obvious opportunity to buy futures & stand for delivery for a 35% discount on physical right? But when they don't have it, Futures = $41.66/oz. #silversqueeze — Jonathan #SILVERSQUEEZE Mergott (@Jmergz1985) February 1, 2021

All the American Eagles are sold out across a number of bullion dealers. On Sunday morning, a few big-name dealers have halted a great number of silver sales. News.Bitcoin.com’s most recent WSB report disclosed how SD Bullion sold nearly 10x the number of silver ounces than usual. People visiting bullion dealer websites like Provident, Apmex, and JD Bullion could see the unprecedented demand targeting physical silver.

“In the last week, we have seen a dramatic shift in Silver demand from our customers,” said Ken Lewis CEO of the bullion dealer Apmex. “For example, the ratio of ounces sold per day was running about two times earlier in the week and closer to four times the average demand by the end of the week,” Lewis added.

The Apmex CEO further stressed:

Once markets closed on Friday, we saw demand hit as much as six times a typical business day and more than 12 times a normal weekend day. Combined with the extremely high demand levels, we are also seeing a surge in new customers. On Saturday alone, we added as many new customers as we usually add in a week.

Additionally, the hashtag “#silversqueeze” has been trending throughout the United States and a few other countries on Twitter during the last 48 hours. By the late afternoon on Sunday, spot silver and futures traded at $27 per Troy ounce, and by Monday morning spot silver traded 7.7% higher at $29.76. The commodity hopped above the $30 region, and silver prices per ounce exchanged hands at $30.35 an ounce. One ounce of .999 silver is hovering in the $29 price handle at the time of publication

CHAPTER ONE: Listening to the Past

“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.” — Satoshi Nakamoto

The trusted third party problem has haunted modern financial systems and centralized exchanges because people require an intermediary to make them work. The third party’s good or bad motives become a defining aspect of the transaction, and the those who use the institutions are at the mercy of those intentions. This is especially true of the current system of state-issued money and central banking.

A trustless system avoids intermediaries and does not depend upon the intentions of participants; that is, the system functions in the same manner regardless of anyone’s intentions. The blockchain, with a transparent and immutable peer-to peer protocol, is called trustless because there is no corruptible intermediary upon whom exchanges must depend.

On a small scale, the trusted third party problem may always exist because a middleman is useful or necessary in some situations. If third parties offer competitive services on a free market, however, the damage of dishonesty or incompetence is limited. People can take their business elsewhere, report a swindler to watchdogs, warn others, and file a lawsuit.

An occasionally dishonest third party is not the problem Satoshi addresses. He speaks to the institutionalized corruption of government and central banks from which the average person could not escape by using a competitor or by suing. Almost everyone who works over the table, runs a business, buys or sells goods, accepts government benefits or pays taxes has had to accept a fiat that constantly plunges in value due to inflation. Almost everyone who uses credit, accepts checks, takes out loans, conducts commerce or does business abroad has needed to go through banks that steal like drunken muggers.

For average people, the situation used to seem hopeless because no legal, practical, and private alternative existed for transferring funds across considerable distance, including borders. Attempts to reform or remove the system also seemed doomed because it was inherently corrupt and self-serving. In fact, fiat and central banking were serving the purpose for which they had been established: financial control by elites. People’s need for money and exchange became their straitjackets.

Then Satoshi. Then the blockchain and crypto. A new concept of money was created in a form that cannot not be inflated; the number of bitcoins is fixed at 21 million divisible units. The supply can only decrease when coins are lost, as inevitably happens. Satoshi notes, “Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.” Bitcoin solved the fiat problem.

A new concept of financial transfer solved the third party problem, especially with regard to banks. Although peer-to-peer transactions involve a middleman or miner, no trust is required since the transaction is released only when “proof of work” is rendered, which consists of solving a complicated math problem. Arriving at a solution may be costly in computer power and time, but the solutions themselves are easy to verify. Satoshi comments, “With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.” The soundness and propriety of the blockchain’s protocol itself is assured by the use of open source that is visible to all and verifiable. The political outcome: A private currency and method of exchange freed people from financial oppression.

The idea of private currency itself is hardly new, however.

Precedent in Radical Individualist Theory

The late Friedrich Hayek is the most respected Austrian economist of the 20th century. His book The Denationalisation of Money: An Analysis of the Theory and Practice of Concurrent Currencies argues vigorously for private and competitive currencies to displace government-issued ones. Hayek ponders a key question. “When one studies the history of money one cannot help wondering why people should have put up for so long with governments exercising an exclusive power over two thousand years that was regularly used to exploit and defraud them. This can be explained only by the myth” that government money was necessary “becoming so firmly established that it did not occur even to the professional students of these matters…ever to question it. But once the validity of the established doctrine is doubted its foundation is rapidly seen to be fragile.”

Governments reap incredible profits from debasing the currency, but the rigged game works only if people have no alternative but to play it. The political purpose of legal tender and banking laws is to grant a monopoly to the state, which permits the redistribution of wealth and power from average people upward to the elite of society. Fiat money and banking remains fragile, however, because the system relies on people either not understanding the dynamics or not having a choice. Hayek wonders why public understanding is so elusive. Why was “a government monopoly of the provision of money…universally regarded as indispensable” and what would happen “if the provision of money were thrown open to the competition of private concerns supplying different currencies?”

With eerie prescience, Hayek argues for currencies developed by entrepreneurs who innovate new forms of money just as they innovate in other areas. One of the drawbacks of government’s monopoly is that it imposes a freeze on the sort of invention that now runs free in crypto. The voluntaryist historian Carl Watner observes, “No one can tell in advance what form these monies might take because no one can know for sure what choices individuals would make or what new technologies might be discovered. Laws forcing people to use the Federal Reserve System money have frozen monetary developments at a certain stage…Just imagine if Congress had protected the Post Office by passing laws that would have prevented people from communicating via the internet. We would never have experienced the marvels of e-mail.”

The late Austrian economist Murray Rothbard also wrestles with the question of “why do people so vigorously resist private currencies?” His book For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto advances an explanation. “If the government and only the government had had a monopoly of the shoe manufacturing and retailing business, how would most of the public treat the libertarian who now came along to advocate that the government get out of the shoe business and throw it open to private enterprise?” Rothbard predicts that the skeptics would attack the libertarian for depriving them of the only possible source of shoes—the government. People are thoroughly indoctrinated to believe that daily life cannot function without the state and fiat.

Hayek and Rothbard are unusual among free-market economists in their embrace of private money and monetary systems. Even laissez-faire zealots rarely champion free-market currencies or private banking. Instead, they debate marginal issues such as fractional reserve and other reforms they think will improve the existing system. Or they argue for the restoration of a gold standard as though it were a panacea. But if a gold standard were applied to fiat, the system would still require people to trust the government and banks. This means trusting both institutions to act against their own interests, which they have historically neglected to do.

The modern neglect of free-market money and banking is odd because 19th century radical individualists focused intensely on the importance of private money and private banking to personal freedom. They placed a primal emphasis on the right of every individual to create his own currency and to function as his own bank. It was a natural right as important as freedom of speech or of religion. The pivotal individualist Benjamin Tucker believed that the right to issue private currency was so important that it could destroy the State all by itself. His reasoning: The money monopoly, including control of credit, was how the State sustained itself and robbed average people not merely of wealth but also of economic opportunity.

Two specific events sculpted the approach that the early individualist-anarchists adopted toward the monetary monopoly. One was the Panic of 1837 that tipped the United States into recession until the mid-1840s. Commonly cited causes of the Panic include a collapsing land bubble and a sharp fall in cotton prices. Blame is also placed at the feet of President Andrew Jackson for vetoing the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States and precipitating an unfortunate chain of economic events. Drawing on the work of Professor of Economics Peter Temin, Rothbard disputes this interpretation.

First, he [Temin] points out that the price inflation really began earlier, when wholesale prices reached a trough of 82 in July 1830 and then rose by 20.7 percent in three years to reach 99 in the fall of 1833. The reason for the price rise is simple: The total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $159 million in 1833, an increase of 45.9 percent, or an annual rise of 15.3 percent. Breaking the figures down further, the total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $155 million a year and a half later, a spectacular expansion of 35 percent. Unquestionably, this monetary expansion was spurred by the still-flourishing Bank of the United States, which increased its notes and deposits from January 1830 to January 1832 from a total of $29 million to $42.1 million, a rise of 45.2 percent. Thus, the price and money inflation in the first few years of the 1830s were again sparked by the expansion of the still-dominant central bank.

Arguably, the Panic began in May 1837 when banks in New York City announced they would not redeem commercial paper for specie at full face value. Of the approximately 800 banks in America, all but six ceased at one point or another to redeem banknotes and deposits for gold or silver coins. Suspicion and hatred of traditional banks and government-issued money soared, with radicals scrutinizing alternate systems.

The other event dramatically to impact the radical fever from monetary reform was the Civil War for which the North financed its fighting through Legal Tender Acts and the National Banking Act of 1863.

The radicals did not merely theorize; they experimented with private currencies and new economic models. Their efforts are fascinating, but they are also cautionary tales. A major problem for 19th-century individualist-anarchism was the movement’s general acceptance of a link between sound money and the labor theory of value. This theory states that the true value of a good or service is based on the labor required to produce it rather than the price at which a seller and buyer are willing to exchange. In short, a good has intrinsic and not subjective value. (More on this in the section on the Regression Theorem.) Happily, their main economic goal was the abolition of the “money monopoly.” The term referred to three different but interacting forms of monopoly: banking, the charging of interest, and the privileged issuance of currency. The abolition of state power over currency was the focus, and they eschewed the use of force to implement their own schemes.

Josiah Warren provided a real-world example of what was meant by a currency that rested on the labor theory of value. Credited with being the first American anarchist, Warren tested his specific solution to the money monopoly through a Time Store from which he issued “Labor Notes.” In 1827, the business opened with $300 worth of groceries and dry goods that were offered at a 7 percent markup from Warren’s own costs in order to cover expenses such as overhead. This was before groceries were prepackaged or preweighed, and it was usual for buyers to bargain with the shopkeeper rather than pay a posted price. One of

Warren’s innovations was to post prices, which drove costs lower because transactions consumed less time. The customer paid in traditional money for the goods and paid with a Labor Note to compensate Warren for his time. The Labor Note obliged the customer to provide Warren with an equivalent amount of his time. If the buyer was a seamstress, for example, the Labor Note committed her to render to Warren X units of time to produce clothing. Warren’s goal was to establish an economy—or to establish a proof of principle, at least—in which profit was based on the exchange of time and labor. The Labor Notes were circulated and traded widely with in the community.

To some degree, Warren succeeded. People traveled from a hundred miles away to avail themselves of the Time Store’s low prices. After a few years, he declared the experiment to be a success and closed the store. Whether the Labor Notes were a success is questionable, however. The store itself may well have succeeded due to its low prices, not to the Notes. Whichever explanation is true, it is difficult to see how this novel currency could function in dense populations or on a grander scale of commerce. Few people today would be convinced of the viability of private money based on the Time Store experiment.

What could convince the public and economists that private currencies work as well or better than government-issued ones? Going back a bit further in American history is a good place to start because the future is always based on the past.

21Shares AG, a Zurich-based investment provider, is launching what is being dubbed as the world’s first Polkadot exchange-traded product, or ETP.

The DOT ETP will be listed on the Swiss exchange SIX on Thursday, February 4, said the company in a statement on Tuesday. DOT is the native token of the Polkadot network.

DOT has since been added to 21Shares’ Crypto Basket ETP (HODL), which tracks five major assets including bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH). Since its addition on Jan. 29, DOT now accounts for 27% of the product behind BTC at 50%.

Hany Rashwan, chief executive officer of 21Shares, said the firm has seen “unprecedented demand” from institutional investors wanting exposure to crypto-assets. He stated that demand for its range of crypto ETPs has soared 500% since the third quarter of 2020, but there has been “a recent surge in interest” for DOT.

“After investors purchase their first bitcoins through our ETPs, there is a natural transition to invest in other crypto assets,” Rashwan detailed.

“We benefit from trusted partners for the liquidity provision and upon continued institutional demand, we are launching the DOT ETP to give investors a safe, regulated, and easy way to obtain exposure to this exciting new blockchain technology,” he added.

Rashwan revealed that 21Shares, an issuer of exchange-traded products, is planning to add up to three ETPs over the next 3 months. He said European investors have been approaching the company to launch new products.

Created by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Polkadot is a cross-blockchain that enables transfers of any type of data or asset, not just tokens. It is also used as an electronic payment system.

DOT is now the world’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market capitalization of $16.55 billion, according to data from markets.Bitcoin.com. At the time of writing, DOT is trading at $17.22, up 8% over the past 24 hours.

Ukraine’s government-owned nuclear power plant picked a firm to build a massive data center in Rivne for cryptocurrency mining operations. After a bidding process, Energoatom chose Kyiv Energy Construction Company to handle the nuclear plant crypto mining project.

Nuclear Power Plant Operator Expects to Launch the Data Center in 2022

According to official documents, the data center will be based in the Rivne nuclear power plant, after the construction firm got 8.92 million Hryvnia ($317,620) in funding. The only competitor in the bidding was Ukrenergobudproek. However, they allegedly made an expensive offer, said the regional news outlet Forklog.

The Kyiv Energy Construction Company expects to finish the data center building by August 31, 2022. Per the announcement, the contractor is required to send the documentation that details the whole process. It includes “host state registers, electronic archives, and computing facilities.”

In terms of technical details, the nuclear power plant has a capacity of 2,657 megawatts, and it was built in the late 1970s. Also, the operations of the state-owned nuclear facilities started at the beginning of 1980.

In October 2020, Energoatom also signed a memorandum with a subsidiary of crypto mining giant Bitfury. With the new data center, local media outlets believe Bitfury miners could move their operations into the power plant’s facilities.

Ukraine’s Interest Towards Building Crypto Mining Data Centers in Nuclear Plants

The deal between Energoatom and Kyiv Energy Construction Company is not a surprising move. In fact, the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine asked Energoatom in May 2020 to conduct research to assess crypto mining’s feasibility at their nuclear plants.

As an anecdotal fact in terms of crypto mining in Ukrainian nuclear plants, the nation’s Security Service found illegal crypto mining equipment in a nuclear power plant in 2019.

The installation’s illegal mining rigs were found in the Southern region of Ukraine. Moreover, the investigations determined that such illegal equipment breached a “state secret.”

Global music distribution service Ditto has unveiled the latest addition to its service lineup for musicians with a blockchain-based financing platform named Opulous.

Opulous Peer-to-Peer Lending Platform Serves as a Loan Pool Designed to Help Artists

Ditto continues its efforts to improve the value chain for artists. Unlike other decentralized finance (defi) protocols, Opulous reflects asset-based lending, which bridges the physical and digital worlds. The Opulous’ defi lending mechanism, which is being developed on the Algorand public blockchain, leverages music copyrights’ tangibility through a smart contract setup that automatically handles principal and interest payments along with distributions to investors.

For musicians already receiving royalties, this presents a unique opportunity to monetize their assets or contribute to the pool to stake other artists. When seeking capital, artists can access funds by collateralizing loans from Opulous’ Music Copyright Pools with their music royalties.

Besides digitizing music as an asset class, the move will invite more democratized participation from artists and investors seeking to gain a foothold in the music industry, which is undergoing tremendous annual growth and expected to double in size by 2030. Artists benefit from interest rates starting as low as 4%, while investors in the copyright pools can add exposure to music royalties as an asset class for 10% returns per annum.

Per Ditto CEO Lee Parsons,

Opulous cuts out traditional banking, providing musicians with a platform with minimal interest payments, while giving investors the chance to stake a claim in one of the most exciting and fastest-growing financial industries in the world.

Ditto, which has already processed more than $1 billion in royalties for its 250,000-plus users, sees industry revenues doubling in the next ten years, building a compelling investment thesis. In keeping with Opulous’ mission to democratize musicians’ financial access, users outside the Ditto ecosystem are welcome to join the peer-to-peer lending framework.

Opulous has raised $1.5 million in funding to-date from BASIC, Borderless Capital, Kosmos Capital, Somesing, and TrustVerse. Roll out of the platform’s minimum viable product (MVP) is anticipated in two months as development proceeds.

Elastos, which built its decentralized application (dapp) platform and currency (ELA) to protect users’ digital assets and creations, will be among the first token staking partners for Opulous’ proof-of-stake consensus protocol. Opulous, in concert with Elastos, will allow investors to stake their Elastos (ELA) coins within the Music Copyright Pools.

According to Clarence Liu, the VP of Development at the Elastos Foundation,

Elastos and Ditto Music have been researching how blockchain can address fundamental inefficiencies in the music industry. Access to funding – which Opulous will address – is only the tip of the iceberg.

“Our collaboration has much more in the pipeline and our community is definitely set on using the forward momentum sparked by recent world events to introduce new users to the decentralized internet ideals set by Elastos,” Liu concludes.

During the last year, Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem has grown exponentially to form a multi Billion Dollar market. As Decentralized Finance expands, it becomes more and more relevant to have cross-chain connections that enable crypto assets to flow instantly and seamlessly across blockchain networks. These make it possible for DeFi platforms to be an effective alternative to centralized exchanges. Today, pNetwork launches the first EOS to Ethereum cross-chain connection to enable the EOS crypto asset to be moved into Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem.

EOS on Ethereum

EOS, the native token on the EOS blockchain, is a top20 cryptocurrency by market cap and the engine powering one of the most active dApps ecosystems. The asset counts over $ 3.5 Billion in daily trading volumes, figuring as the 9th most traded cryptocurrency. At present, only a fraction of the total is happening in a decentralized fashion.

While the DeFi ecosystem on EOS continues to grow, it has not yet reached Ethereum’s size. The latter powers Billions in daily trading volumes, Uniswap being the largestlarges liquidity protocol in existence and the fourth biggest DeFi protocol in terms of Total Value Locked.

Following the delivery of 26 bridges connecting six different blockchain protocols, including the cross-chain transfer of popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin, pNetwork launches today a new cross-chain connection that brings EOS to Ethereum.

As the first tokenised version of EOS, pEOS makes the asset compatible with Ethereum’s DeFi. This creates a benefit on both sides, enabling Ethereum’s DeFi protocols to expand their range of assets supported and granting EOS the option to be traded in a decentralized fashion as well as being supported as a collateral type by major Ethereum-based landing platforms.

Cross-chain connections are critical for a variety of use-cases, from NFTs to market making to decentralized indexes such as PieDAO’s Pies. pNetwork-powered asset tokenisation on Ethereum enables such indexes to represent the entire crypto market.

All pTokenised assets are pegged 1:1 to their underlying asset and are available for automated minting or redeeming on the pTokens dApp. In addition, pTokens are supported on a variety of DeFi protocols, decentralized exchanges and wallets on a growing number of blockchains.

Making Ethereum and EOS dApps Interoperable

Ethereum and EOS are two of the most active ecosystems for dApps, counting thousands of users each. By connecting these two blockchain environments, pNetwork aims to support the growth and development of decentralized applications such as lending/borrowing, trading, derivatives, and more. Acting as a cross-chain highway for cryptocurrencies to frictionlessly move from one blockchain to another, pNetwork powers the first bi-directional connection between the Ethereum and EOS blockchains.

Users on either blockchain are now able to interact with both ecosystems without ever leaving their blockchain of choice. Projects from both Ethereum and EOS communities have developed building blocks to create the next-generation financial system – with the connection between these two, users will find an even more powerful DeFi ecosystem.

By leveraging pNetwork’s cross-chain solution, dApps on the two blockchain platforms now have the opportunity to interoperate. Each ecosystem leveraging its counterpart’s strengths ultimately creates a benefit on both sides and sets the basis for sustainable growth. The presence of an EOS/ETH decentralized trading pair both with Ethereum’s and EOS’s decentralized finance, for example, makes it possible for market makers to arbitrage between the two blockchains. This results in a more liquid decentralized market for both assets.

As the so-called ‘meme coin’ is actively making the headlines within the crypto sphere, a publicly-traded company is joining the dogecoin frenzy. Kronos Advanced Technology announced they’ll start accepting dogecoin as one of its payment methods.

Kronos Also Accepts Other Cryptocurrencies Such as Bitcoin and Ether

According to the announcement, the Los Angeles-based firm is adding dogecoin (DOGE) to its accepted payment form. In fact, customers will be able to purchase air purifiers, and personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies via the meme coin.

Adopting dogecoin as a payment method was not as part as just of a crypto adoption-driven maneuver. The company praised the popularity of the token and its uniqueness within the industry.

Also, Kronos pointed out that dogecoins transactions’ speed is a positive note for the Shiba Inu inspired meme token. So far, the company accepts several cryptos as payment methods, such as bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), litecoin (LTC), among others.

Expanding N95 Mask Market Into the Dogecoin Community

Michael Rubinov, president of Kronos Advanced Technologies, commented on the company’s stance towards cryptocurrencies:

In the last ten years, much has been said about how cryptocurrency will revolutionize payments, services, businesses and will change the world the way we know it. Cryptocurrency has changed e-commerce: as more and more people now shop online. Cryptocurrency gives customers more reasons to utilize the convenience of online shopping, as it mitigates the risk of fraud for both vendors and shoppers.

By adopting dogecoin as a form of payment, Kronos also expect to market N95 masks to the entire meme coin community on Reddit, which has grown over 670,000 members. The company also praised the fact that Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk endorses dogecoin as one of his favorite cryptocurrencies.

Despite the recent frenzy seen in the meme coin, the latest markets.Bitcoin.com data shows that dogecoin is exchanging hands at $0.0317, down -20.43% on Tuesday. The market capitalization still stands at $4.08 billion.

Spacex and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been trying to get to the bottom of what happened with the popular trading app Robinhood when it stopped people from buying shares of hot stocks, like Gamestop. The shares of these stocks became popular due to the Wallstreetbets movement.

Elon Musk Says People Want the Truth From Robinhood

During an interview on The Good Time Show via the Clubhouse app Sunday night, Elon Musk grilled the CEO of trading app Robinhood, Vlad Tenev, over the company’s decision to restrict hot stocks last week, including Gamestop. On Friday, Robinhood also restricted crypto trading, citing “extraordinary market conditions.”

“What happened last week? Why can’t people buy the Gamestop shares? The people demand an answer and they want to know the details and the truth,” Musk said.

Tenev began by explaining the structure of his company. “Robinhood is actually a couple of companies,” he described. Robinhood Financial processes trades, Robinhood Securities clears and settles the trades, and Robinhood Crypto which deals with crypto trades.

The Robinhood CEO detailed that last Wednesday, his platform experienced “unprecedented volume” as “a lot of these so-called meme stocks were going viral on social media and people were joining Robinhood” to buy these stocks. Consequently, the company “received a file” from the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) Thursday morning at about 3:30 AM PST. It requested Robinhood to “put up money to the NSCC based on some factors,” including the volatility of certain securities. Tenev clarified that “this is the equities business so it’s based on stock trading and not options trading or anything else,” elaborating:

They gave us a file with a deposit and the request was around $3 billion dollars which is about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is.

Musk interrupted Tenev, questioning: “Why is that so high? It sounds like this is an unprecedented increase in demand for capital. What formula did they use to calculate that?”

Tenev replied: “We don’t have the full details. It’s a little bit of an opaque formula but there’s a component called the VAR of it, which is the Value at Risk, and that’s based on kind of some fairly quantitative things … and then there’s a special component which is discretionary so that kind of acts as a multiplier.” Tenev also noted that up until that point, his company “has raised a little bit around two billion dollars in total venture capital,” so the request was “a big number.”

The Tesla CEO interrupted again, asking: “What everyone wants to know is did something maybe shady go down here? It seems weird that you’d get a sudden $10 billion demand in the morning … suddenly out of nowhere.” Tenev swiftly corrected Musk that the number was $3 billion. The Robinhood CEO then emphasized:

I wouldn’t impugn shadiness to it or anything like that, and actually the NSCC was reasonable subsequent to this. They worked with us to actually lower it. It was unprecedented activity.

Musk abruptly asked Tenev: “Is there anyone holding you hostage right now?” Tenev chuckled and replied: “No, no, I’m okay. Thanks for asking.” Both laughed.

The Robinhood CEO proceeded to explain what happened, calling the experience “nerve-wrecking.” He said after receiving the request for $3 billion, his chief operating officer called up someone higher up at the NSCC to discuss what to do. “There was another call and they lowered it to something like $1.4 billion from $3 billion,” Tenev reiterated that it was still a high number. His company then proposed a plan to the NSCC of “marking these volatile stocks that were kind of driving the activity position-closing only.”

Then, at about 5 to 5:30 AM PST, before the market opened, the NSCC came back and reduced the deposit requirement to $700 million, “which we then deposited and paid promptly,” Tenev emphasized. Acknowledging that the move was bad for customers, the Robinhood CEO said, “We had no choice, in this case. We had to conform to our regulatory capital requirements and so the team did what they could to make sure we were available for customers.”

The Spacex CEO further questioned: “Who controls this organization, this clearinghouse?” Tenev replied: “It’s a consortium. It’s not quite a government agency. I don’t really know the details of all of that.” Nonetheless, he emphasized that “To be fair … I think there was legitimate sort of turmoil in the markets … so there probably is some amount of extra risk in the system that warrants higher requirements so it’s not entirely unreasonable.” He noted that lots of other brokers were in the same situation and had to restrict the same activity.

“So it sounds like this organization calls you up and they basically have a gun to your head: either hand over this money or else,” the Spacex CEO summarized, elaborating:

Basically, what people are wondering is did you sell your clients down the river or did you have no choice. If you had no choice, that’s understandable but then we got to find out why you had no choice and who are these people that are saying you have no choice.

“I think that’s fair. We have to comply with these requirements. Financial institutions have requirements,” Tenev responded. Nonetheless, he suggested that it would be helpful to know the formula the NSCC uses to calculate these requirements so companies can plan better.

Musk proceeded to ask about whether there was outside pressure forcing Robinhood to take the action it did. Tenev affirmed that there is “a rumor that Citadel or other market makers kind of pressured us into doing this.” However, he clarified, “that’s just false,” emphasizing that “this was a clearinghouse decision and it was just based on the capital requirements so from our perspective Citadel and other market makers weren’t involved in that.”

During the same Clubhouse interview, Elon also revealed that he is a supporter of bitcoin and should have bought the cryptocurrency eight years ago. He believes that bitcoin is on the verge of getting broad acceptance by traditional finance people. On Monday, Robinhood raised another $2.4 billion from shareholders after it secured $1 billion last Thursday.

PRESS RELEASE. The AdGram service was founded a year ago and is currently the largest advertising exchange in Telegram.

AdGram helps brands place large advertising volumes in channels and groups quickly and efficiently. Channels and groups benefit from expansion of their audience, it is easy to find advertisers and increase the earnings from advertising placements via AdGram.

Over the last 12 months, the service has gained a huge experience in communications with both advertisers and administrators from different countries, which has highlighted issues with settlements in multiple currencies. After overcoming these obstacles, it was decided that cryptocurrency could be the key to solving this problem.

With the termination of the Telegram team’s work on the TON project in May 2020 (the messenger lost one of its monetization methods), Free TON was launched which took over the development and popularization of TON Crystal using the open source code from the original TON. The uniqueness of FreeTON is that it is one of the few projects where all the tokens belong to the community and it is developing as a decentralized autonomous organization.

The potential of the underlying technology and the growth of the community inspired AdGram and in October 2020 they partnered with the FreeTON Community and fully integrated Crystal as a means of payment. Synergy with FreeTON made it possible to take a big step towards using cryptocurrencies as a single, simple and clear means of payment.

The ability to pay with tokens for advertising in Telegram creates a powerful use case for the TON Crystal token. Huge and constantly growing volume of the advertising market is vital for tokenomics as it creates supply and demand for market participants, thereby increasing the liquidity of the token itself.

For administrators and advertisers transactions in TON Crystal is simple, convenient and fast! It also solves the problem of collecting details for transfers in various currencies, and avoids paying banking fees.

Advertising on Telegram and the FreeTON blockchain, which is the successor of Durov’s original (but never happened Durov’s TON), create a strong and impact-resistant synergy of mutual benefits. This shows markets and communities can develop in a self-regulated environment.

PRESS RELEASE. CEX.IO LOAN experiences massive institutional demand for its crypto-backed lending service, with 41% of customers requesting to borrow cash against Bitcoin, 53% against Ethereum, and 6% against DeFi tokens.

Crypto-backed lending service CEX.IO LOAN that launched in October 2020 in select global jurisdictions, has been experiencing major demand, receiving over $100 million worth of loan requests to date. While the service has been widely popular among retail investors, most of the platform’s loan requests came from institutional investors.

According to CEX.IO LOAN, such an increase in demand can be attributed to the institutionalization of the cryptocurrency industry. Institutional investors, who have cryptocurrencies in their possession, regard it as a potential collateral for borrowing funds and actively utilise it as such. The borrowed funds are then used for further investment purposes.

In addition to featuring cutting-edge security and advanced anti-fraud measures, CEX.IO Group operates a regulated service, which has been licensed as a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) provider by the Gibraltar Financial Service Commission (GFSC) since last year. In addition to this, the Government of Gibraltar recently granted CEX.IO Limited a Money Lender License, allowing the firm to extend its ecosystem of regulated services with CEX.IO LOAN.

Institutional clients also prefer the company’s digital asset-backed lending service due to the convenience offered to users. On the CEX.IO LOAN platform, customers can borrow cash against their cryptocurrency assets in a quick and simple manner, without having to deal with credit checks or any unnecessary paperwork. To access the company’s instant crypto-backed lending service, new users have to open an account at the digital asset exchange and pass the mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML checks.

CEX.IO LOAN serves various cryptocurrency market participants, from retail investors, traders, and HODLers to startups, entrepreneurs, and large enterprises. As part of a flexible crypto-backed lending service, users can borrow any amount between $500 and $100,000 at competitive interest rates starting at 8.75% per year. Loan duration ranging from seven days to one year.

Currently, retail users can borrow funds against their Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) assets. Based on the company’s data, the feature has already experienced high demand from VIP clients, with 41% of all CEX.IO LOAN customers borrowing cash against Bitcoin (BTC), 53% against Ethereum (ETH), and 6% against DeFi tokens.

The company has recently introduced a VIP-exclusive feature to offer flexible lending conditions and the ability to use decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens as collateral for institutional clients on the crypto-backed lending platform.

Furthermore, to best serve institutional customers, the requests and queries of VIP clients are handled individually by dedicated personal managers on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Interestingly, 14% of CEX.IO VIP customers have already asked their personal managers about borrowing funds via the crypto-backed lending service.

“As institutional investors find the digital asset industry increasingly attractive, it’s a pleasure to serve them with our enterprise-grade instant crypto-backed loan platform. Security, convenience, and compliance are key priorities for corporate clients, which are features that we have been providing to all our clients in the rapidly growing CEX.IO ecosystem. Most importantly, we want to provide institutional clients with the best service. For that reason, VIP clients enjoy exclusive benefits, such as dedicated personal managers and flexible lending options, on the CEX.IO LOAN platform,” Anton Chashchin, Commercial Director for the CEX.IO LOAN service, stated.

In the announcement, the firm revealed further details about the size of the funds clients borrow on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Based on the company’s data, while retail investors borrow $1,400 on average, VIP clients request larger-sized loans that vary in size, with the typical amount being $1 million or higher.

Institutional clients do not just borrow more but also need the funds for more extended periods which usually range between 6 and 12 months. According to the company, this phenomenon indicates a long-term strategy for VIP clients to manage their assets.

PRESS RELEASE. PARSIQ, a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform connecting on-chain and off-chain applications in real-time, announced that its PRQ token is now listed on OKEx with USDT base pair.

Please take note of the following go-live schedule:

PRQ Deposit : 07:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Spot Trading : PRQ / USDT : 10:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Withdrawal : 10:00 January 29, 2021 (UTC)

PARSIQ is a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform that serves as a multi-level bridge between blockchains and off-chain applications. PARSIQ’s features automate the blockchain analytics and monitoring process, providing customizable workflows with real-time intelligence.

Developers and individual users can transform the blockchain data to their favorite off-chain application or web service.

Among the obvious use cases is monitoring the wallets of traders and ordinary users. Among the non-obvious are complex system integrations for financial institutions and DeFi projects that use the PARSIQ infrastructure to improve security, conduct audits, comply with regulatory requirements, AML, and expand their workflows in other ways.

The infrastructure underneath PARSIQ’s user interface is built with their proprietary programming language ParsiQL, and its users’ benefits are multiplying with each supported integration.

PRQ Token

PARSIQ Token (PRQ) is an essential piece of the PARSIQ platform that co-exists with FIAT payments for using its services. Payments within the platform that are made in PRQ tokens guarantee a discounted rate. During the first Epoch when PRQ tokens are used as payment for running Smart-Triggers users receive higher execution limits, unlock transport methods, and are able to propose features that can be added to the platform.

In October 2020, the PARSIQ team released plans for Epoch 2.0.

#1. Public Projects

With Public Projects users can subscribe to existing PARSIQ Projects that were pre-made by other users. By paying in PRQ, users that have subscribed to the Public Project will incentivize the creators to create interesting, complex, and more important – problem-solving projects.

#2. User Data and PRQ

Every single monitoring target (primitive of type address, a struct with the field of address type, table row) would require 1 PRQ to hold after the implementation. It means that if there are 1000 addresses (960 in the table as rows, 30 as primitives, 10 in the structs) then the User would need 1000 PRQ on the connected Ethereum Account balance.

#3. IQ Protocol

IQ Protocol will allow risk-free PRQ lending and collateral-less borrowing. Risk-free PRQ lending means that PRQ is not transferred from the lender’s address to the borrower’s address. Details on the algorithm are available in the dedicated explainer on PARSIQ’s blog.

#4. PRQBoost

PRQ Boost is a liquidity boost program to incentivize PRQ/ETH liquidity providers on Uniswap, which goes with the PRQBOOST utility tokens to increase rewards for liquidity providers.

PARSIQ is actively working to partner with major layer 1 blockchain protocols to expand the range of blockchain integrations and give projects that build on those protocols the ability to monitor and automate workflows between blockchain and off-chain.

PRESS RELEASE. YFX, the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts has just launched, adding an important piece to the DeFi money legos, and creating a direct competition against CEX on derivatives trading.

The most traded Bitcoin product in centralized exchanges is Bitcoin futures, which is 10 times bigger than spot trading in terms of the trading volume. But in DEX, spot trading platforms like Uniswap are occupying a large portion of the total trading volume, and there is not a single decentralized futures trading platform that could reach even 1/10 of Uniswap’s trading volume. What stops decentralized futures trading platforms from becoming 10 times bigger than Uniswap? Why are decentralized futures trading platforms performing worse than their centralized counterparts?

The main reason is that decentralized futures exchanges don’t currently provide an attractive futures product to compete with centralized futures exchanges. For instance, centralized futures exchanges like BitMex can provide 100x leverage on Bitcoin futures trading. On the other hand, decentralized futures exchanges like dYdX only offer 10x leverage. None of the decentralized exchanges can keep up with the 100x leverage offering from centralized exchanges.

YFX Descartes V1 uses QIC-AMM and a system de-risk mechanism to migrate perpetual futures trading from CEX to DEX without reducing the trading leverage, which makes YFX the first DEX that could offer 100x leverage on a perpetual contract. You can do everything on YFX that you can do on BitMex or OKEx. YFX is poised to compete directly against established centralized exchanges. YFX Descartes V1 runs on the TRON MainNet, for faster transaction times and cheaper gas fees compared to Ethereum. The YFX team is also working on Ethereum’s Layer 2 solution to provide pragmatic perpetual trading on DEX. YFX team plans to launch their DEX on Huobi Heco and Ethereum Test net in Q1, 2021.

About YFX

YFX is the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts. YFX Descartes V1 launched on the TRON MainNet, and all trades are held and processed by smart contracts. The main goal of the YFX team, which is formed by a group of engineers who have years of experience working on trading systems and blockchain, is to build a DEX that can compete with CEX on derivative trading.

The Wall Street Bets saga, an incredibly ridiculous story about a group of amateur Reddit investors who beat career Wall Street hedge funds at their own game, is to be made into a movie.

According to a report by online news site Deadline on Jan. 31, Metro Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) won the rights to produce the film in a bidding war involving major Hollywood movie houses.

The movie is to be based on a book proposed by author Ben Mezrich. Mezrich’s previous work, “The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding Of Facebook, a Tale Of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal,” was adapted into the motion picture “The Social Network.”

The title to his planned latest book offering is called “The Antisocial Network,” said the report, quoting sources familiar with the development. The book is expected to go out to publishers later this February, it said.

However, it is not yet clear what shape or structure the movie will take. MGM’s Michael DeLuca will produce the film. DeLuca also produced the Academy-Award winning The Social Network. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss will executive produce via their Winklevoss Pictures production company.

The Wall Street Bets group noticed that major hedge funds on Wall Street had been placing short bets against companies they considered to be dying. The funds particularly targeted Gamestop, the world’s largest video game retailer, continually shorting the company’s shares.

But the Redditors saw an opportunity to make profit and collectively bet the other way, buying shares and stock options. This resulted in the value of the Gamestop shares soaring by more than 2,600% in January.

Hedge funds that had shorted the stock incurred losses running into several billions of dollars. One fund, Melvin Capital, reportedly lost up to $7 billion to the “short squeeze” in January, forcing it to restructure its investment portfolio to ensure a faster escape in future “squeezes.”

The Reddit traders also extended the pump to a few other stocks considered to be dying, including AMC (which climbed over 900% in January), as well as Nokia and Blackberry. This surge of activity resulted in a major controversy when the trading app Robinhood began restricting trade on certain stocks.

Alongside the cryptocurrency’s meteoric climb over the back half of 2020 and early 2021, a curious phenomenon has unfolded; heightened profit-taking and conversion to fiat currencies. Data collected by Simplex, a fiat-crypto gateway, underscores this seemingly paradoxical development.

A Curious Race to Convert Crypto to Fiat Has Accompanied Bitcoin’s Latest Drive Higher

Sharing exclusive data with Bitcoin.com, Simplex cofounder and chief analytics officer Netanel Kabala says:

While the international press coverage of Bitcoin’s rally has caused a swathe of new users to flock to the industry and buy-in, outflows have been equally significant. Of the total amount of cryptocurrency sold in the last six months, 43% was off ramped in December alone.

A quick look at Google Trends for the term ‘Bitcoin’ echoes these developments, especially now that new equity instruments like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and big-name funds like Blackrock are adding exposure and raising crypto awareness.

Still, given the increased ability to quickly convert crypto and withdraw in fiat currencies, the uptick in funds leaving the ecosystem is astonishing. Part of this can be attributed to the growing fungibility of cryptocurrency, primarily helped by the support of players like Simplex, which empowers users to buy, sell, and spend crypto through Visa partnerships.

Although some of the latest rally’s onlookers have decried the rapid rise in crypto valuations as proof that a bubble is forming in this nascent asset class, others within the industry see the development as a harbinger of times to come. One of the areas this is most apparent is altcoins.

Data compiled by Simplex illustrates that as Bitcoin prices have leveled off above $30,000, daily purchases of altcoins have risen by approximately 65%. More interestingly, the data highlights that newer users account for nearly 20% of this volume, marking a sharp increase in the number of novice retail investors expanding and diversifying their exposure within the ecosystem.

Poloniex, one of the top 20 global cryptocurrency exchanges, which has adopted Simplex’s platform, has experienced these results firsthand. Karen McHenry, Poloniex’s Director of Product, attributes this development to greater access within the ecosystem, especially with Simplex’s buy option, which promotes instant account funding alongside the heightened ability to cash out quickly.

She also doesn’t see the ability to more quickly convert from crypto to fiat as harming interest despite the eyepopping amounts taken off exchanges.

It may sound surprising, but adding the ‘sell’ option actually has a positive impact on the number of crypto transactions too.

Though this easy offramp and soaring volume of sell orders might seem negative for prices, it can also be viewed as a healthy reflection of the ecosystem’s growing use cases. Besides making it easier to exit and enter, growing areas like decentralized finance (defi) and greater fungibility all contribute to a cryptocurrency’s value proposition.

As institutions begin lining up to add exposure as retail accumulation climbs, Bitcoin momentum may actually accelerate, and by extension, lift the altcoins sought after by the newcomers seeking opportunities outside the seminal crypto coin.

McHenry adds:

If the bull market can maintain its momentum, some of these BTC profits will flow into altcoins, which are particularly popular among retail investors. This creates a positive feedback loop, with traders who turn a profit prone to telling their friends about crypto, which brings more investment into the space.

This past week, another social media trend started on the Reddit forum r/wallstreetbets, which aims to initiate a large silver short squeeze in order to push the price of the precious metal to $1,000 per ounce. However, the silver squeeze trend comes with controversy, as numerous wallstreetbets supporters believe hedge funds like Melvin Capital and Citadel are behind the silver push.

The Controversial ‘Silver Squeeze’

During the last week, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the wallstreetbets (WSB) saga taking place on social media forums and the infamous subreddit r/wallstreetbets. Since the mega short squeeze on the Gamestop (GME) shares, the squeeze maneuver has also spilled into a number of other stocks. This week, shares from the Russell 3000 Index (RUA) were targeted including tickers like NOK, GOGO, AMCX, and FIZZ. But the trend didn’t stop there, as one post, in particular, had called for a “silver squeeze.” The WSB Reddit post called for the silver squeeze to push the price of silver from $25 per ounce to $1,000.

Now since the post was published, the Reddit admins in charge of moderating r/wallstreetbets removed the post. But that was long after the message was made viral by the participants discussing the pros and cons of attempting to squeeze silver. Now the reason people think the silver short squeeze post may be shady, is because a number of WSB Redditors believe the silver squeeze was invoked by the hedge funds losing money in order to cover their GME losses. There are a great number of Reddit posts warning that people should not participate in the silver short squeeze.

One post said:

Citadel is the 5th largest owner of [silver], it’s imperative we do not ‘squeeze’ it. These are hedge fund bots spamming awards.

The people who dislike the silver trend on WSB, have also warned that Melvin Capital Management is also a big silver holder. Unfortunately, it is hard to tell where the silver pump threads and posts are stemming from, as there are many free-market supporters who are fans of the precious metal sometimes referred to as the ‘poor man’s gold.’

Despite this, there are numbers of WSB fans and Redditors claiming the silver pump stemmed from hedge fund people and they believe there are imposters everywhere now. Some of these people are growing irrational, getting mad at anyone who posts about silver. Many WSB supporters might be feeling the pain from Gamestop Corp. shares dropping significantly on Monday.

Silver soars past $30 a troy ounce as Reddit-fuelled buying frenzy continues for 3rd day. #Silversqueeze pic.twitter.com/mLmasUBrq1 — Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) February 1, 2021

In Spite of Controversy, Something Is Sparking Silver Demand

Despite the speculation, some sort of demand was invoked when it comes to silver prices and obtaining physical bullion. For instance, if you are attempting to purchase an ounce or ounces of silver bullion online, the process is far more complicated now than it was last week. A large portion of bars and coins are either sold out or the prices are marked up considerably.

This is simple arbitrage. #Silver futures are 28.67. Silver Eagles on Apmex are $41.66, thats a 45% premium to futures. Obvious opportunity to buy futures & stand for delivery for a 35% discount on physical right? But when they don't have it, Futures = $41.66/oz. #silversqueeze — Jonathan #SILVERSQUEEZE Mergott (@Jmergz1985) February 1, 2021

All the American Eagles are sold out across a number of bullion dealers. On Sunday morning, a few big-name dealers have halted a great number of silver sales. News.Bitcoin.com’s most recent WSB report disclosed how SD Bullion sold nearly 10x the number of silver ounces than usual. People visiting bullion dealer websites like Provident, Apmex, and JD Bullion could see the unprecedented demand targeting physical silver.

“In the last week, we have seen a dramatic shift in Silver demand from our customers,” said Ken Lewis CEO of the bullion dealer Apmex. “For example, the ratio of ounces sold per day was running about two times earlier in the week and closer to four times the average demand by the end of the week,” Lewis added.

The Apmex CEO further stressed:

Once markets closed on Friday, we saw demand hit as much as six times a typical business day and more than 12 times a normal weekend day. Combined with the extremely high demand levels, we are also seeing a surge in new customers. On Saturday alone, we added as many new customers as we usually add in a week.

Additionally, the hashtag “#silversqueeze” has been trending throughout the United States and a few other countries on Twitter during the last 48 hours. By the late afternoon on Sunday, spot silver and futures traded at $27 per Troy ounce, and by Monday morning spot silver traded 7.7% higher at $29.76. The commodity hopped above the $30 region, and silver prices per ounce exchanged hands at $30.35 an ounce. One ounce of .999 silver is hovering in the $29 price handle at the time of publication

CHAPTER ONE: Listening to the Past

“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.” — Satoshi Nakamoto

The trusted third party problem has haunted modern financial systems and centralized exchanges because people require an intermediary to make them work. The third party’s good or bad motives become a defining aspect of the transaction, and the those who use the institutions are at the mercy of those intentions. This is especially true of the current system of state-issued money and central banking.

A trustless system avoids intermediaries and does not depend upon the intentions of participants; that is, the system functions in the same manner regardless of anyone’s intentions. The blockchain, with a transparent and immutable peer-to peer protocol, is called trustless because there is no corruptible intermediary upon whom exchanges must depend.

On a small scale, the trusted third party problem may always exist because a middleman is useful or necessary in some situations. If third parties offer competitive services on a free market, however, the damage of dishonesty or incompetence is limited. People can take their business elsewhere, report a swindler to watchdogs, warn others, and file a lawsuit.

An occasionally dishonest third party is not the problem Satoshi addresses. He speaks to the institutionalized corruption of government and central banks from which the average person could not escape by using a competitor or by suing. Almost everyone who works over the table, runs a business, buys or sells goods, accepts government benefits or pays taxes has had to accept a fiat that constantly plunges in value due to inflation. Almost everyone who uses credit, accepts checks, takes out loans, conducts commerce or does business abroad has needed to go through banks that steal like drunken muggers.

For average people, the situation used to seem hopeless because no legal, practical, and private alternative existed for transferring funds across considerable distance, including borders. Attempts to reform or remove the system also seemed doomed because it was inherently corrupt and self-serving. In fact, fiat and central banking were serving the purpose for which they had been established: financial control by elites. People’s need for money and exchange became their straitjackets.

Then Satoshi. Then the blockchain and crypto. A new concept of money was created in a form that cannot not be inflated; the number of bitcoins is fixed at 21 million divisible units. The supply can only decrease when coins are lost, as inevitably happens. Satoshi notes, “Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.” Bitcoin solved the fiat problem.

A new concept of financial transfer solved the third party problem, especially with regard to banks. Although peer-to-peer transactions involve a middleman or miner, no trust is required since the transaction is released only when “proof of work” is rendered, which consists of solving a complicated math problem. Arriving at a solution may be costly in computer power and time, but the solutions themselves are easy to verify. Satoshi comments, “With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.” The soundness and propriety of the blockchain’s protocol itself is assured by the use of open source that is visible to all and verifiable. The political outcome: A private currency and method of exchange freed people from financial oppression.

The idea of private currency itself is hardly new, however.

Precedent in Radical Individualist Theory

The late Friedrich Hayek is the most respected Austrian economist of the 20th century. His book The Denationalisation of Money: An Analysis of the Theory and Practice of Concurrent Currencies argues vigorously for private and competitive currencies to displace government-issued ones. Hayek ponders a key question. “When one studies the history of money one cannot help wondering why people should have put up for so long with governments exercising an exclusive power over two thousand years that was regularly used to exploit and defraud them. This can be explained only by the myth” that government money was necessary “becoming so firmly established that it did not occur even to the professional students of these matters…ever to question it. But once the validity of the established doctrine is doubted its foundation is rapidly seen to be fragile.”

Governments reap incredible profits from debasing the currency, but the rigged game works only if people have no alternative but to play it. The political purpose of legal tender and banking laws is to grant a monopoly to the state, which permits the redistribution of wealth and power from average people upward to the elite of society. Fiat money and banking remains fragile, however, because the system relies on people either not understanding the dynamics or not having a choice. Hayek wonders why public understanding is so elusive. Why was “a government monopoly of the provision of money…universally regarded as indispensable” and what would happen “if the provision of money were thrown open to the competition of private concerns supplying different currencies?”

With eerie prescience, Hayek argues for currencies developed by entrepreneurs who innovate new forms of money just as they innovate in other areas. One of the drawbacks of government’s monopoly is that it imposes a freeze on the sort of invention that now runs free in crypto. The voluntaryist historian Carl Watner observes, “No one can tell in advance what form these monies might take because no one can know for sure what choices individuals would make or what new technologies might be discovered. Laws forcing people to use the Federal Reserve System money have frozen monetary developments at a certain stage…Just imagine if Congress had protected the Post Office by passing laws that would have prevented people from communicating via the internet. We would never have experienced the marvels of e-mail.”

The late Austrian economist Murray Rothbard also wrestles with the question of “why do people so vigorously resist private currencies?” His book For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto advances an explanation. “If the government and only the government had had a monopoly of the shoe manufacturing and retailing business, how would most of the public treat the libertarian who now came along to advocate that the government get out of the shoe business and throw it open to private enterprise?” Rothbard predicts that the skeptics would attack the libertarian for depriving them of the only possible source of shoes—the government. People are thoroughly indoctrinated to believe that daily life cannot function without the state and fiat.

Hayek and Rothbard are unusual among free-market economists in their embrace of private money and monetary systems. Even laissez-faire zealots rarely champion free-market currencies or private banking. Instead, they debate marginal issues such as fractional reserve and other reforms they think will improve the existing system. Or they argue for the restoration of a gold standard as though it were a panacea. But if a gold standard were applied to fiat, the system would still require people to trust the government and banks. This means trusting both institutions to act against their own interests, which they have historically neglected to do.

The modern neglect of free-market money and banking is odd because 19th century radical individualists focused intensely on the importance of private money and private banking to personal freedom. They placed a primal emphasis on the right of every individual to create his own currency and to function as his own bank. It was a natural right as important as freedom of speech or of religion. The pivotal individualist Benjamin Tucker believed that the right to issue private currency was so important that it could destroy the State all by itself. His reasoning: The money monopoly, including control of credit, was how the State sustained itself and robbed average people not merely of wealth but also of economic opportunity.

Two specific events sculpted the approach that the early individualist-anarchists adopted toward the monetary monopoly. One was the Panic of 1837 that tipped the United States into recession until the mid-1840s. Commonly cited causes of the Panic include a collapsing land bubble and a sharp fall in cotton prices. Blame is also placed at the feet of President Andrew Jackson for vetoing the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States and precipitating an unfortunate chain of economic events. Drawing on the work of Professor of Economics Peter Temin, Rothbard disputes this interpretation.

First, he [Temin] points out that the price inflation really began earlier, when wholesale prices reached a trough of 82 in July 1830 and then rose by 20.7 percent in three years to reach 99 in the fall of 1833. The reason for the price rise is simple: The total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $159 million in 1833, an increase of 45.9 percent, or an annual rise of 15.3 percent. Breaking the figures down further, the total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $155 million a year and a half later, a spectacular expansion of 35 percent. Unquestionably, this monetary expansion was spurred by the still-flourishing Bank of the United States, which increased its notes and deposits from January 1830 to January 1832 from a total of $29 million to $42.1 million, a rise of 45.2 percent. Thus, the price and money inflation in the first few years of the 1830s were again sparked by the expansion of the still-dominant central bank.

Arguably, the Panic began in May 1837 when banks in New York City announced they would not redeem commercial paper for specie at full face value. Of the approximately 800 banks in America, all but six ceased at one point or another to redeem banknotes and deposits for gold or silver coins. Suspicion and hatred of traditional banks and government-issued money soared, with radicals scrutinizing alternate systems.

The other event dramatically to impact the radical fever from monetary reform was the Civil War for which the North financed its fighting through Legal Tender Acts and the National Banking Act of 1863.

The radicals did not merely theorize; they experimented with private currencies and new economic models. Their efforts are fascinating, but they are also cautionary tales. A major problem for 19th-century individualist-anarchism was the movement’s general acceptance of a link between sound money and the labor theory of value. This theory states that the true value of a good or service is based on the labor required to produce it rather than the price at which a seller and buyer are willing to exchange. In short, a good has intrinsic and not subjective value. (More on this in the section on the Regression Theorem.) Happily, their main economic goal was the abolition of the “money monopoly.” The term referred to three different but interacting forms of monopoly: banking, the charging of interest, and the privileged issuance of currency. The abolition of state power over currency was the focus, and they eschewed the use of force to implement their own schemes.

Josiah Warren provided a real-world example of what was meant by a currency that rested on the labor theory of value. Credited with being the first American anarchist, Warren tested his specific solution to the money monopoly through a Time Store from which he issued “Labor Notes.” In 1827, the business opened with $300 worth of groceries and dry goods that were offered at a 7 percent markup from Warren’s own costs in order to cover expenses such as overhead. This was before groceries were prepackaged or preweighed, and it was usual for buyers to bargain with the shopkeeper rather than pay a posted price. One of

Warren’s innovations was to post prices, which drove costs lower because transactions consumed less time. The customer paid in traditional money for the goods and paid with a Labor Note to compensate Warren for his time. The Labor Note obliged the customer to provide Warren with an equivalent amount of his time. If the buyer was a seamstress, for example, the Labor Note committed her to render to Warren X units of time to produce clothing. Warren’s goal was to establish an economy—or to establish a proof of principle, at least—in which profit was based on the exchange of time and labor. The Labor Notes were circulated and traded widely with in the community.

To some degree, Warren succeeded. People traveled from a hundred miles away to avail themselves of the Time Store’s low prices. After a few years, he declared the experiment to be a success and closed the store. Whether the Labor Notes were a success is questionable, however. The store itself may well have succeeded due to its low prices, not to the Notes. Whichever explanation is true, it is difficult to see how this novel currency could function in dense populations or on a grander scale of commerce. Few people today would be convinced of the viability of private money based on the Time Store experiment.

What could convince the public and economists that private currencies work as well or better than government-issued ones? Going back a bit further in American history is a good place to start because the future is always based on the past.

The modern neglect of free-market money and banking is odd because 19th century radical individualists focused intensely on the importance of private money and private banking to personal freedom.

21Shares AG, a Zurich-based investment provider, is launching what is being dubbed as the world’s first Polkadot exchange-traded product, or ETP.

The DOT ETP will be listed on the Swiss exchange SIX on Thursday, February 4, said the company in a statement on Tuesday. DOT is the native token of the Polkadot network.

DOT has since been added to 21Shares’ Crypto Basket ETP (HODL), which tracks five major assets including bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH). Since its addition on Jan. 29, DOT now accounts for 27% of the product behind BTC at 50%.

Hany Rashwan, chief executive officer of 21Shares, said the firm has seen “unprecedented demand” from institutional investors wanting exposure to crypto-assets. He stated that demand for its range of crypto ETPs has soared 500% since the third quarter of 2020, but there has been “a recent surge in interest” for DOT.

“After investors purchase their first bitcoins through our ETPs, there is a natural transition to invest in other crypto assets,” Rashwan detailed.

“We benefit from trusted partners for the liquidity provision and upon continued institutional demand, we are launching the DOT ETP to give investors a safe, regulated, and easy way to obtain exposure to this exciting new blockchain technology,” he added.

Rashwan revealed that 21Shares, an issuer of exchange-traded products, is planning to add up to three ETPs over the next 3 months. He said European investors have been approaching the company to launch new products.

Created by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Polkadot is a cross-blockchain that enables transfers of any type of data or asset, not just tokens. It is also used as an electronic payment system.

DOT is now the world’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market capitalization of $16.55 billion, according to data from markets.Bitcoin.com. At the time of writing, DOT is trading at $17.22, up 8% over the past 24 hours.

Ukraine’s government-owned nuclear power plant picked a firm to build a massive data center in Rivne for cryptocurrency mining operations. After a bidding process, Energoatom chose Kyiv Energy Construction Company to handle the nuclear plant crypto mining project.

Nuclear Power Plant Operator Expects to Launch the Data Center in 2022

According to official documents, the data center will be based in the Rivne nuclear power plant, after the construction firm got 8.92 million Hryvnia ($317,620) in funding. The only competitor in the bidding was Ukrenergobudproek. However, they allegedly made an expensive offer, said the regional news outlet Forklog.

The Kyiv Energy Construction Company expects to finish the data center building by August 31, 2022. Per the announcement, the contractor is required to send the documentation that details the whole process. It includes “host state registers, electronic archives, and computing facilities.”

In terms of technical details, the nuclear power plant has a capacity of 2,657 megawatts, and it was built in the late 1970s. Also, the operations of the state-owned nuclear facilities started at the beginning of 1980.

In October 2020, Energoatom also signed a memorandum with a subsidiary of crypto mining giant Bitfury. With the new data center, local media outlets believe Bitfury miners could move their operations into the power plant’s facilities.

Ukraine’s Interest Towards Building Crypto Mining Data Centers in Nuclear Plants

The deal between Energoatom and Kyiv Energy Construction Company is not a surprising move. In fact, the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine asked Energoatom in May 2020 to conduct research to assess crypto mining’s feasibility at their nuclear plants.

As an anecdotal fact in terms of crypto mining in Ukrainian nuclear plants, the nation’s Security Service found illegal crypto mining equipment in a nuclear power plant in 2019.

The installation’s illegal mining rigs were found in the Southern region of Ukraine. Moreover, the investigations determined that such illegal equipment breached a “state secret.”

Global music distribution service Ditto has unveiled the latest addition to its service lineup for musicians with a blockchain-based financing platform named Opulous.

Opulous Peer-to-Peer Lending Platform Serves as a Loan Pool Designed to Help Artists

Ditto continues its efforts to improve the value chain for artists. Unlike other decentralized finance (defi) protocols, Opulous reflects asset-based lending, which bridges the physical and digital worlds. The Opulous’ defi lending mechanism, which is being developed on the Algorand public blockchain, leverages music copyrights’ tangibility through a smart contract setup that automatically handles principal and interest payments along with distributions to investors.

For musicians already receiving royalties, this presents a unique opportunity to monetize their assets or contribute to the pool to stake other artists. When seeking capital, artists can access funds by collateralizing loans from Opulous’ Music Copyright Pools with their music royalties.

Besides digitizing music as an asset class, the move will invite more democratized participation from artists and investors seeking to gain a foothold in the music industry, which is undergoing tremendous annual growth and expected to double in size by 2030. Artists benefit from interest rates starting as low as 4%, while investors in the copyright pools can add exposure to music royalties as an asset class for 10% returns per annum.

Per Ditto CEO Lee Parsons,

Opulous cuts out traditional banking, providing musicians with a platform with minimal interest payments, while giving investors the chance to stake a claim in one of the most exciting and fastest-growing financial industries in the world.

Ditto, which has already processed more than $1 billion in royalties for its 250,000-plus users, sees industry revenues doubling in the next ten years, building a compelling investment thesis. In keeping with Opulous’ mission to democratize musicians’ financial access, users outside the Ditto ecosystem are welcome to join the peer-to-peer lending framework.

Opulous has raised $1.5 million in funding to-date from BASIC, Borderless Capital, Kosmos Capital, Somesing, and TrustVerse. Roll out of the platform’s minimum viable product (MVP) is anticipated in two months as development proceeds.

Elastos, which built its decentralized application (dapp) platform and currency (ELA) to protect users’ digital assets and creations, will be among the first token staking partners for Opulous’ proof-of-stake consensus protocol. Opulous, in concert with Elastos, will allow investors to stake their Elastos (ELA) coins within the Music Copyright Pools.

According to Clarence Liu, the VP of Development at the Elastos Foundation,

Elastos and Ditto Music have been researching how blockchain can address fundamental inefficiencies in the music industry. Access to funding – which Opulous will address – is only the tip of the iceberg.

“Our collaboration has much more in the pipeline and our community is definitely set on using the forward momentum sparked by recent world events to introduce new users to the decentralized internet ideals set by Elastos,” Liu concludes.

During the last year, Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem has grown exponentially to form a multi Billion Dollar market. As Decentralized Finance expands, it becomes more and more relevant to have cross-chain connections that enable crypto assets to flow instantly and seamlessly across blockchain networks. These make it possible for DeFi platforms to be an effective alternative to centralized exchanges. Today, pNetwork launches the first EOS to Ethereum cross-chain connection to enable the EOS crypto asset to be moved into Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem.

EOS on Ethereum

EOS, the native token on the EOS blockchain, is a top20 cryptocurrency by market cap and the engine powering one of the most active dApps ecosystems. The asset counts over $ 3.5 Billion in daily trading volumes, figuring as the 9th most traded cryptocurrency. At present, only a fraction of the total is happening in a decentralized fashion.

While the DeFi ecosystem on EOS continues to grow, it has not yet reached Ethereum’s size. The latter powers Billions in daily trading volumes, Uniswap being the largestlarges liquidity protocol in existence and the fourth biggest DeFi protocol in terms of Total Value Locked.

Following the delivery of 26 bridges connecting six different blockchain protocols, including the cross-chain transfer of popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin, pNetwork launches today a new cross-chain connection that brings EOS to Ethereum.

As the first tokenised version of EOS, pEOS makes the asset compatible with Ethereum’s DeFi. This creates a benefit on both sides, enabling Ethereum’s DeFi protocols to expand their range of assets supported and granting EOS the option to be traded in a decentralized fashion as well as being supported as a collateral type by major Ethereum-based landing platforms.

Cross-chain connections are critical for a variety of use-cases, from NFTs to market making to decentralized indexes such as PieDAO’s Pies. pNetwork-powered asset tokenisation on Ethereum enables such indexes to represent the entire crypto market.

All pTokenised assets are pegged 1:1 to their underlying asset and are available for automated minting or redeeming on the pTokens dApp. In addition, pTokens are supported on a variety of DeFi protocols, decentralized exchanges and wallets on a growing number of blockchains.

Making Ethereum and EOS dApps Interoperable

Ethereum and EOS are two of the most active ecosystems for dApps, counting thousands of users each. By connecting these two blockchain environments, pNetwork aims to support the growth and development of decentralized applications such as lending/borrowing, trading, derivatives, and more. Acting as a cross-chain highway for cryptocurrencies to frictionlessly move from one blockchain to another, pNetwork powers the first bi-directional connection between the Ethereum and EOS blockchains.

Users on either blockchain are now able to interact with both ecosystems without ever leaving their blockchain of choice. Projects from both Ethereum and EOS communities have developed building blocks to create the next-generation financial system – with the connection between these two, users will find an even more powerful DeFi ecosystem.

By leveraging pNetwork’s cross-chain solution, dApps on the two blockchain platforms now have the opportunity to interoperate. Each ecosystem leveraging its counterpart’s strengths ultimately creates a benefit on both sides and sets the basis for sustainable growth. The presence of an EOS/ETH decentralized trading pair both with Ethereum’s and EOS’s decentralized finance, for example, makes it possible for market makers to arbitrage between the two blockchains. This results in a more liquid decentralized market for both assets.

As the so-called ‘meme coin’ is actively making the headlines within the crypto sphere, a publicly-traded company is joining the dogecoin frenzy. Kronos Advanced Technology announced they’ll start accepting dogecoin as one of its payment methods.

Kronos Also Accepts Other Cryptocurrencies Such as Bitcoin and Ether

According to the announcement, the Los Angeles-based firm is adding dogecoin (DOGE) to its accepted payment form. In fact, customers will be able to purchase air purifiers, and personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies via the meme coin.

Adopting dogecoin as a payment method was not as part as just of a crypto adoption-driven maneuver. The company praised the popularity of the token and its uniqueness within the industry.

Also, Kronos pointed out that dogecoins transactions’ speed is a positive note for the Shiba Inu inspired meme token. So far, the company accepts several cryptos as payment methods, such as bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), litecoin (LTC), among others.

Expanding N95 Mask Market Into the Dogecoin Community

Michael Rubinov, president of Kronos Advanced Technologies, commented on the company’s stance towards cryptocurrencies:

In the last ten years, much has been said about how cryptocurrency will revolutionize payments, services, businesses and will change the world the way we know it. Cryptocurrency has changed e-commerce: as more and more people now shop online. Cryptocurrency gives customers more reasons to utilize the convenience of online shopping, as it mitigates the risk of fraud for both vendors and shoppers.

By adopting dogecoin as a form of payment, Kronos also expect to market N95 masks to the entire meme coin community on Reddit, which has grown over 670,000 members. The company also praised the fact that Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk endorses dogecoin as one of his favorite cryptocurrencies.

Despite the recent frenzy seen in the meme coin, the latest markets.Bitcoin.com data shows that dogecoin is exchanging hands at $0.0317, down -20.43% on Tuesday. The market capitalization still stands at $4.08 billion.

Spacex and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been trying to get to the bottom of what happened with the popular trading app Robinhood when it stopped people from buying shares of hot stocks, like Gamestop. The shares of these stocks became popular due to the Wallstreetbets movement.

Elon Musk Says People Want the Truth From Robinhood

During an interview on The Good Time Show via the Clubhouse app Sunday night, Elon Musk grilled the CEO of trading app Robinhood, Vlad Tenev, over the company’s decision to restrict hot stocks last week, including Gamestop. On Friday, Robinhood also restricted crypto trading, citing “extraordinary market conditions.”

“What happened last week? Why can’t people buy the Gamestop shares? The people demand an answer and they want to know the details and the truth,” Musk said.

Tenev began by explaining the structure of his company. “Robinhood is actually a couple of companies,” he described. Robinhood Financial processes trades, Robinhood Securities clears and settles the trades, and Robinhood Crypto which deals with crypto trades.

The Robinhood CEO detailed that last Wednesday, his platform experienced “unprecedented volume” as “a lot of these so-called meme stocks were going viral on social media and people were joining Robinhood” to buy these stocks. Consequently, the company “received a file” from the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) Thursday morning at about 3:30 AM PST. It requested Robinhood to “put up money to the NSCC based on some factors,” including the volatility of certain securities. Tenev clarified that “this is the equities business so it’s based on stock trading and not options trading or anything else,” elaborating:

They gave us a file with a deposit and the request was around $3 billion dollars which is about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is.

Musk interrupted Tenev, questioning: “Why is that so high? It sounds like this is an unprecedented increase in demand for capital. What formula did they use to calculate that?”

Tenev replied: “We don’t have the full details. It’s a little bit of an opaque formula but there’s a component called the VAR of it, which is the Value at Risk, and that’s based on kind of some fairly quantitative things … and then there’s a special component which is discretionary so that kind of acts as a multiplier.” Tenev also noted that up until that point, his company “has raised a little bit around two billion dollars in total venture capital,” so the request was “a big number.”

The Tesla CEO interrupted again, asking: “What everyone wants to know is did something maybe shady go down here? It seems weird that you’d get a sudden $10 billion demand in the morning … suddenly out of nowhere.” Tenev swiftly corrected Musk that the number was $3 billion. The Robinhood CEO then emphasized:

I wouldn’t impugn shadiness to it or anything like that, and actually the NSCC was reasonable subsequent to this. They worked with us to actually lower it. It was unprecedented activity.

Musk abruptly asked Tenev: “Is there anyone holding you hostage right now?” Tenev chuckled and replied: “No, no, I’m okay. Thanks for asking.” Both laughed.

The Robinhood CEO proceeded to explain what happened, calling the experience “nerve-wrecking.” He said after receiving the request for $3 billion, his chief operating officer called up someone higher up at the NSCC to discuss what to do. “There was another call and they lowered it to something like $1.4 billion from $3 billion,” Tenev reiterated that it was still a high number. His company then proposed a plan to the NSCC of “marking these volatile stocks that were kind of driving the activity position-closing only.”

Then, at about 5 to 5:30 AM PST, before the market opened, the NSCC came back and reduced the deposit requirement to $700 million, “which we then deposited and paid promptly,” Tenev emphasized. Acknowledging that the move was bad for customers, the Robinhood CEO said, “We had no choice, in this case. We had to conform to our regulatory capital requirements and so the team did what they could to make sure we were available for customers.”

The Spacex CEO further questioned: “Who controls this organization, this clearinghouse?” Tenev replied: “It’s a consortium. It’s not quite a government agency. I don’t really know the details of all of that.” Nonetheless, he emphasized that “To be fair … I think there was legitimate sort of turmoil in the markets … so there probably is some amount of extra risk in the system that warrants higher requirements so it’s not entirely unreasonable.” He noted that lots of other brokers were in the same situation and had to restrict the same activity.

“So it sounds like this organization calls you up and they basically have a gun to your head: either hand over this money or else,” the Spacex CEO summarized, elaborating:

Basically, what people are wondering is did you sell your clients down the river or did you have no choice. If you had no choice, that’s understandable but then we got to find out why you had no choice and who are these people that are saying you have no choice.

“I think that’s fair. We have to comply with these requirements. Financial institutions have requirements,” Tenev responded. Nonetheless, he suggested that it would be helpful to know the formula the NSCC uses to calculate these requirements so companies can plan better.

Musk proceeded to ask about whether there was outside pressure forcing Robinhood to take the action it did. Tenev affirmed that there is “a rumor that Citadel or other market makers kind of pressured us into doing this.” However, he clarified, “that’s just false,” emphasizing that “this was a clearinghouse decision and it was just based on the capital requirements so from our perspective Citadel and other market makers weren’t involved in that.”

During the same Clubhouse interview, Elon also revealed that he is a supporter of bitcoin and should have bought the cryptocurrency eight years ago. He believes that bitcoin is on the verge of getting broad acceptance by traditional finance people. On Monday, Robinhood raised another $2.4 billion from shareholders after it secured $1 billion last Thursday.

PRESS RELEASE. The AdGram service was founded a year ago and is currently the largest advertising exchange in Telegram.

AdGram helps brands place large advertising volumes in channels and groups quickly and efficiently. Channels and groups benefit from expansion of their audience, it is easy to find advertisers and increase the earnings from advertising placements via AdGram.

Over the last 12 months, the service has gained a huge experience in communications with both advertisers and administrators from different countries, which has highlighted issues with settlements in multiple currencies. After overcoming these obstacles, it was decided that cryptocurrency could be the key to solving this problem.

With the termination of the Telegram team’s work on the TON project in May 2020 (the messenger lost one of its monetization methods), Free TON was launched which took over the development and popularization of TON Crystal using the open source code from the original TON. The uniqueness of FreeTON is that it is one of the few projects where all the tokens belong to the community and it is developing as a decentralized autonomous organization.

The potential of the underlying technology and the growth of the community inspired AdGram and in October 2020 they partnered with the FreeTON Community and fully integrated Crystal as a means of payment. Synergy with FreeTON made it possible to take a big step towards using cryptocurrencies as a single, simple and clear means of payment.

The ability to pay with tokens for advertising in Telegram creates a powerful use case for the TON Crystal token. Huge and constantly growing volume of the advertising market is vital for tokenomics as it creates supply and demand for market participants, thereby increasing the liquidity of the token itself.

For administrators and advertisers transactions in TON Crystal is simple, convenient and fast! It also solves the problem of collecting details for transfers in various currencies, and avoids paying banking fees.

Advertising on Telegram and the FreeTON blockchain, which is the successor of Durov’s original (but never happened Durov’s TON), create a strong and impact-resistant synergy of mutual benefits. This shows markets and communities can develop in a self-regulated environment.

PRESS RELEASE. CEX.IO LOAN experiences massive institutional demand for its crypto-backed lending service, with 41% of customers requesting to borrow cash against Bitcoin, 53% against Ethereum, and 6% against DeFi tokens.

Crypto-backed lending service CEX.IO LOAN that launched in October 2020 in select global jurisdictions, has been experiencing major demand, receiving over $100 million worth of loan requests to date. While the service has been widely popular among retail investors, most of the platform’s loan requests came from institutional investors.

According to CEX.IO LOAN, such an increase in demand can be attributed to the institutionalization of the cryptocurrency industry. Institutional investors, who have cryptocurrencies in their possession, regard it as a potential collateral for borrowing funds and actively utilise it as such. The borrowed funds are then used for further investment purposes.

In addition to featuring cutting-edge security and advanced anti-fraud measures, CEX.IO Group operates a regulated service, which has been licensed as a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) provider by the Gibraltar Financial Service Commission (GFSC) since last year. In addition to this, the Government of Gibraltar recently granted CEX.IO Limited a Money Lender License, allowing the firm to extend its ecosystem of regulated services with CEX.IO LOAN.

Institutional clients also prefer the company’s digital asset-backed lending service due to the convenience offered to users. On the CEX.IO LOAN platform, customers can borrow cash against their cryptocurrency assets in a quick and simple manner, without having to deal with credit checks or any unnecessary paperwork. To access the company’s instant crypto-backed lending service, new users have to open an account at the digital asset exchange and pass the mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML checks.

CEX.IO LOAN serves various cryptocurrency market participants, from retail investors, traders, and HODLers to startups, entrepreneurs, and large enterprises. As part of a flexible crypto-backed lending service, users can borrow any amount between $500 and $100,000 at competitive interest rates starting at 8.75% per year. Loan duration ranging from seven days to one year.

Currently, retail users can borrow funds against their Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) assets. Based on the company’s data, the feature has already experienced high demand from VIP clients, with 41% of all CEX.IO LOAN customers borrowing cash against Bitcoin (BTC), 53% against Ethereum (ETH), and 6% against DeFi tokens.

The company has recently introduced a VIP-exclusive feature to offer flexible lending conditions and the ability to use decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens as collateral for institutional clients on the crypto-backed lending platform.

Furthermore, to best serve institutional customers, the requests and queries of VIP clients are handled individually by dedicated personal managers on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Interestingly, 14% of CEX.IO VIP customers have already asked their personal managers about borrowing funds via the crypto-backed lending service.

“As institutional investors find the digital asset industry increasingly attractive, it’s a pleasure to serve them with our enterprise-grade instant crypto-backed loan platform. Security, convenience, and compliance are key priorities for corporate clients, which are features that we have been providing to all our clients in the rapidly growing CEX.IO ecosystem. Most importantly, we want to provide institutional clients with the best service. For that reason, VIP clients enjoy exclusive benefits, such as dedicated personal managers and flexible lending options, on the CEX.IO LOAN platform,” Anton Chashchin, Commercial Director for the CEX.IO LOAN service, stated.

In the announcement, the firm revealed further details about the size of the funds clients borrow on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Based on the company’s data, while retail investors borrow $1,400 on average, VIP clients request larger-sized loans that vary in size, with the typical amount being $1 million or higher.

Institutional clients do not just borrow more but also need the funds for more extended periods which usually range between 6 and 12 months. According to the company, this phenomenon indicates a long-term strategy for VIP clients to manage their assets.

PRESS RELEASE. PARSIQ, a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform connecting on-chain and off-chain applications in real-time, announced that its PRQ token is now listed on OKEx with USDT base pair.

Please take note of the following go-live schedule:

PRQ Deposit : 07:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Spot Trading : PRQ / USDT : 10:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Withdrawal : 10:00 January 29, 2021 (UTC)

PARSIQ is a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform that serves as a multi-level bridge between blockchains and off-chain applications. PARSIQ’s features automate the blockchain analytics and monitoring process, providing customizable workflows with real-time intelligence.

Developers and individual users can transform the blockchain data to their favorite off-chain application or web service.

Among the obvious use cases is monitoring the wallets of traders and ordinary users. Among the non-obvious are complex system integrations for financial institutions and DeFi projects that use the PARSIQ infrastructure to improve security, conduct audits, comply with regulatory requirements, AML, and expand their workflows in other ways.

The infrastructure underneath PARSIQ’s user interface is built with their proprietary programming language ParsiQL, and its users’ benefits are multiplying with each supported integration.

PRQ Token

PARSIQ Token (PRQ) is an essential piece of the PARSIQ platform that co-exists with FIAT payments for using its services. Payments within the platform that are made in PRQ tokens guarantee a discounted rate. During the first Epoch when PRQ tokens are used as payment for running Smart-Triggers users receive higher execution limits, unlock transport methods, and are able to propose features that can be added to the platform.

In October 2020, the PARSIQ team released plans for Epoch 2.0.

#1. Public Projects

With Public Projects users can subscribe to existing PARSIQ Projects that were pre-made by other users. By paying in PRQ, users that have subscribed to the Public Project will incentivize the creators to create interesting, complex, and more important – problem-solving projects.

#2. User Data and PRQ

Every single monitoring target (primitive of type address, a struct with the field of address type, table row) would require 1 PRQ to hold after the implementation. It means that if there are 1000 addresses (960 in the table as rows, 30 as primitives, 10 in the structs) then the User would need 1000 PRQ on the connected Ethereum Account balance.

#3. IQ Protocol

IQ Protocol will allow risk-free PRQ lending and collateral-less borrowing. Risk-free PRQ lending means that PRQ is not transferred from the lender’s address to the borrower’s address. Details on the algorithm are available in the dedicated explainer on PARSIQ’s blog.

#4. PRQBoost

PRQ Boost is a liquidity boost program to incentivize PRQ/ETH liquidity providers on Uniswap, which goes with the PRQBOOST utility tokens to increase rewards for liquidity providers.

PARSIQ is actively working to partner with major layer 1 blockchain protocols to expand the range of blockchain integrations and give projects that build on those protocols the ability to monitor and automate workflows between blockchain and off-chain.

PRESS RELEASE. YFX, the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts has just launched, adding an important piece to the DeFi money legos, and creating a direct competition against CEX on derivatives trading.

The most traded Bitcoin product in centralized exchanges is Bitcoin futures, which is 10 times bigger than spot trading in terms of the trading volume. But in DEX, spot trading platforms like Uniswap are occupying a large portion of the total trading volume, and there is not a single decentralized futures trading platform that could reach even 1/10 of Uniswap’s trading volume. What stops decentralized futures trading platforms from becoming 10 times bigger than Uniswap? Why are decentralized futures trading platforms performing worse than their centralized counterparts?

The main reason is that decentralized futures exchanges don’t currently provide an attractive futures product to compete with centralized futures exchanges. For instance, centralized futures exchanges like BitMex can provide 100x leverage on Bitcoin futures trading. On the other hand, decentralized futures exchanges like dYdX only offer 10x leverage. None of the decentralized exchanges can keep up with the 100x leverage offering from centralized exchanges.

YFX Descartes V1 uses QIC-AMM and a system de-risk mechanism to migrate perpetual futures trading from CEX to DEX without reducing the trading leverage, which makes YFX the first DEX that could offer 100x leverage on a perpetual contract. You can do everything on YFX that you can do on BitMex or OKEx. YFX is poised to compete directly against established centralized exchanges. YFX Descartes V1 runs on the TRON MainNet, for faster transaction times and cheaper gas fees compared to Ethereum. The YFX team is also working on Ethereum’s Layer 2 solution to provide pragmatic perpetual trading on DEX. YFX team plans to launch their DEX on Huobi Heco and Ethereum Test net in Q1, 2021.

About YFX

YFX is the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts. YFX Descartes V1 launched on the TRON MainNet, and all trades are held and processed by smart contracts. The main goal of the YFX team, which is formed by a group of engineers who have years of experience working on trading systems and blockchain, is to build a DEX that can compete with CEX on derivative trading.

The Wall Street Bets saga, an incredibly ridiculous story about a group of amateur Reddit investors who beat career Wall Street hedge funds at their own game, is to be made into a movie.

According to a report by online news site Deadline on Jan. 31, Metro Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) won the rights to produce the film in a bidding war involving major Hollywood movie houses.

The movie is to be based on a book proposed by author Ben Mezrich. Mezrich’s previous work, “The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding Of Facebook, a Tale Of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal,” was adapted into the motion picture “The Social Network.”

The title to his planned latest book offering is called “The Antisocial Network,” said the report, quoting sources familiar with the development. The book is expected to go out to publishers later this February, it said.

However, it is not yet clear what shape or structure the movie will take. MGM’s Michael DeLuca will produce the film. DeLuca also produced the Academy-Award winning The Social Network. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss will executive produce via their Winklevoss Pictures production company.

The Wall Street Bets group noticed that major hedge funds on Wall Street had been placing short bets against companies they considered to be dying. The funds particularly targeted Gamestop, the world’s largest video game retailer, continually shorting the company’s shares.

But the Redditors saw an opportunity to make profit and collectively bet the other way, buying shares and stock options. This resulted in the value of the Gamestop shares soaring by more than 2,600% in January.

Hedge funds that had shorted the stock incurred losses running into several billions of dollars. One fund, Melvin Capital, reportedly lost up to $7 billion to the “short squeeze” in January, forcing it to restructure its investment portfolio to ensure a faster escape in future “squeezes.”

The Reddit traders also extended the pump to a few other stocks considered to be dying, including AMC (which climbed over 900% in January), as well as Nokia and Blackberry. This surge of activity resulted in a major controversy when the trading app Robinhood began restricting trade on certain stocks.

[],2021-02-02 04:00:07+00:00,https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/orders.jpg,"Soaring Sell Orders Contrast Sharply with Bitcoin’s Renewed Bull Run

Alongside the cryptocurrency’s meteoric climb over the back half of 2020 and early 2021, a curious phenomenon has unfolded; heightened profit-taking and conversion to fiat currencies. Data collected by Simplex, a fiat-crypto gateway, underscores this seemingly paradoxical development.

A Curious Race to Convert Crypto to Fiat Has Accompanied Bitcoin’s Latest Drive Higher

Sharing exclusive data with Bitcoin.com, Simplex cofounder and chief analytics officer Netanel Kabala says:

While the international press coverage of Bitcoin’s rally has caused a swathe of new users to flock to the industry and buy-in, outflows have been equally significant. Of the total amount of cryptocurrency sold in the last six months, 43% was off ramped in December alone.

A quick look at Google Trends for the term ‘Bitcoin’ echoes these developments, especially now that new equity instruments like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and big-name funds like Blackrock are adding exposure and raising crypto awareness.

Still, given the increased ability to quickly convert crypto and withdraw in fiat currencies, the uptick in funds leaving the ecosystem is astonishing. Part of this can be attributed to the growing fungibility of cryptocurrency, primarily helped by the support of players like Simplex, which empowers users to buy, sell, and spend crypto through Visa partnerships.

Although some of the latest rally’s onlookers have decried the rapid rise in crypto valuations as proof that a bubble is forming in this nascent asset class, others within the industry see the development as a harbinger of times to come. One of the areas this is most apparent is altcoins.

Data compiled by Simplex illustrates that as Bitcoin prices have leveled off above $30,000, daily purchases of altcoins have risen by approximately 65%. More interestingly, the data highlights that newer users account for nearly 20% of this volume, marking a sharp increase in the number of novice retail investors expanding and diversifying their exposure within the ecosystem.

Poloniex, one of the top 20 global cryptocurrency exchanges, which has adopted Simplex’s platform, has experienced these results firsthand. Karen McHenry, Poloniex’s Director of Product, attributes this development to greater access within the ecosystem, especially with Simplex’s buy option, which promotes instant account funding alongside the heightened ability to cash out quickly.

She also doesn’t see the ability to more quickly convert from crypto to fiat as harming interest despite the eyepopping amounts taken off exchanges.

It may sound surprising, but adding the ‘sell’ option actually has a positive impact on the number of crypto transactions too.

Though this easy offramp and soaring volume of sell orders might seem negative for prices, it can also be viewed as a healthy reflection of the ecosystem’s growing use cases. Besides making it easier to exit and enter, growing areas like decentralized finance (defi) and greater fungibility all contribute to a cryptocurrency’s value proposition.

As institutions begin lining up to add exposure as retail accumulation climbs, Bitcoin momentum may actually accelerate, and by extension, lift the altcoins sought after by the newcomers seeking opportunities outside the seminal crypto coin.

McHenry adds:

If the bull market can maintain its momentum, some of these BTC profits will flow into altcoins, which are particularly popular among retail investors. This creates a positive feedback loop, with traders who turn a profit prone to telling their friends about crypto, which brings more investment into the space.

This past week, another social media trend started on the Reddit forum r/wallstreetbets, which aims to initiate a large silver short squeeze in order to push the price of the precious metal to $1,000 per ounce. However, the silver squeeze trend comes with controversy, as numerous wallstreetbets supporters believe hedge funds like Melvin Capital and Citadel are behind the silver push.

The Controversial ‘Silver Squeeze’

During the last week, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the wallstreetbets (WSB) saga taking place on social media forums and the infamous subreddit r/wallstreetbets. Since the mega short squeeze on the Gamestop (GME) shares, the squeeze maneuver has also spilled into a number of other stocks. This week, shares from the Russell 3000 Index (RUA) were targeted including tickers like NOK, GOGO, AMCX, and FIZZ. But the trend didn’t stop there, as one post, in particular, had called for a “silver squeeze.” The WSB Reddit post called for the silver squeeze to push the price of silver from $25 per ounce to $1,000.

Now since the post was published, the Reddit admins in charge of moderating r/wallstreetbets removed the post. But that was long after the message was made viral by the participants discussing the pros and cons of attempting to squeeze silver. Now the reason people think the silver short squeeze post may be shady, is because a number of WSB Redditors believe the silver squeeze was invoked by the hedge funds losing money in order to cover their GME losses. There are a great number of Reddit posts warning that people should not participate in the silver short squeeze.

One post said:

Citadel is the 5th largest owner of [silver], it’s imperative we do not ‘squeeze’ it. These are hedge fund bots spamming awards.

The people who dislike the silver trend on WSB, have also warned that Melvin Capital Management is also a big silver holder. Unfortunately, it is hard to tell where the silver pump threads and posts are stemming from, as there are many free-market supporters who are fans of the precious metal sometimes referred to as the ‘poor man’s gold.’

Despite this, there are numbers of WSB fans and Redditors claiming the silver pump stemmed from hedge fund people and they believe there are imposters everywhere now. Some of these people are growing irrational, getting mad at anyone who posts about silver. Many WSB supporters might be feeling the pain from Gamestop Corp. shares dropping significantly on Monday.

Silver soars past $30 a troy ounce as Reddit-fuelled buying frenzy continues for 3rd day. #Silversqueeze pic.twitter.com/mLmasUBrq1 — Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) February 1, 2021

In Spite of Controversy, Something Is Sparking Silver Demand

Despite the speculation, some sort of demand was invoked when it comes to silver prices and obtaining physical bullion. For instance, if you are attempting to purchase an ounce or ounces of silver bullion online, the process is far more complicated now than it was last week. A large portion of bars and coins are either sold out or the prices are marked up considerably.

This is simple arbitrage. #Silver futures are 28.67. Silver Eagles on Apmex are $41.66, thats a 45% premium to futures. Obvious opportunity to buy futures & stand for delivery for a 35% discount on physical right? But when they don't have it, Futures = $41.66/oz. #silversqueeze — Jonathan #SILVERSQUEEZE Mergott (@Jmergz1985) February 1, 2021

All the American Eagles are sold out across a number of bullion dealers. On Sunday morning, a few big-name dealers have halted a great number of silver sales. News.Bitcoin.com’s most recent WSB report disclosed how SD Bullion sold nearly 10x the number of silver ounces than usual. People visiting bullion dealer websites like Provident, Apmex, and JD Bullion could see the unprecedented demand targeting physical silver.

“In the last week, we have seen a dramatic shift in Silver demand from our customers,” said Ken Lewis CEO of the bullion dealer Apmex. “For example, the ratio of ounces sold per day was running about two times earlier in the week and closer to four times the average demand by the end of the week,” Lewis added.

The Apmex CEO further stressed:

Once markets closed on Friday, we saw demand hit as much as six times a typical business day and more than 12 times a normal weekend day. Combined with the extremely high demand levels, we are also seeing a surge in new customers. On Saturday alone, we added as many new customers as we usually add in a week.

Additionally, the hashtag “#silversqueeze” has been trending throughout the United States and a few other countries on Twitter during the last 48 hours. By the late afternoon on Sunday, spot silver and futures traded at $27 per Troy ounce, and by Monday morning spot silver traded 7.7% higher at $29.76. The commodity hopped above the $30 region, and silver prices per ounce exchanged hands at $30.35 an ounce. One ounce of .999 silver is hovering in the $29 price handle at the time of publication

CHAPTER ONE: Listening to the Past

“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.” — Satoshi Nakamoto

The trusted third party problem has haunted modern financial systems and centralized exchanges because people require an intermediary to make them work. The third party’s good or bad motives become a defining aspect of the transaction, and the those who use the institutions are at the mercy of those intentions. This is especially true of the current system of state-issued money and central banking.

A trustless system avoids intermediaries and does not depend upon the intentions of participants; that is, the system functions in the same manner regardless of anyone’s intentions. The blockchain, with a transparent and immutable peer-to peer protocol, is called trustless because there is no corruptible intermediary upon whom exchanges must depend.

On a small scale, the trusted third party problem may always exist because a middleman is useful or necessary in some situations. If third parties offer competitive services on a free market, however, the damage of dishonesty or incompetence is limited. People can take their business elsewhere, report a swindler to watchdogs, warn others, and file a lawsuit.

An occasionally dishonest third party is not the problem Satoshi addresses. He speaks to the institutionalized corruption of government and central banks from which the average person could not escape by using a competitor or by suing. Almost everyone who works over the table, runs a business, buys or sells goods, accepts government benefits or pays taxes has had to accept a fiat that constantly plunges in value due to inflation. Almost everyone who uses credit, accepts checks, takes out loans, conducts commerce or does business abroad has needed to go through banks that steal like drunken muggers.

For average people, the situation used to seem hopeless because no legal, practical, and private alternative existed for transferring funds across considerable distance, including borders. Attempts to reform or remove the system also seemed doomed because it was inherently corrupt and self-serving. In fact, fiat and central banking were serving the purpose for which they had been established: financial control by elites. People’s need for money and exchange became their straitjackets.

Then Satoshi. Then the blockchain and crypto. A new concept of money was created in a form that cannot not be inflated; the number of bitcoins is fixed at 21 million divisible units. The supply can only decrease when coins are lost, as inevitably happens. Satoshi notes, “Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.” Bitcoin solved the fiat problem.

A new concept of financial transfer solved the third party problem, especially with regard to banks. Although peer-to-peer transactions involve a middleman or miner, no trust is required since the transaction is released only when “proof of work” is rendered, which consists of solving a complicated math problem. Arriving at a solution may be costly in computer power and time, but the solutions themselves are easy to verify. Satoshi comments, “With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.” The soundness and propriety of the blockchain’s protocol itself is assured by the use of open source that is visible to all and verifiable. The political outcome: A private currency and method of exchange freed people from financial oppression.

The idea of private currency itself is hardly new, however.

Precedent in Radical Individualist Theory

The late Friedrich Hayek is the most respected Austrian economist of the 20th century. His book The Denationalisation of Money: An Analysis of the Theory and Practice of Concurrent Currencies argues vigorously for private and competitive currencies to displace government-issued ones. Hayek ponders a key question. “When one studies the history of money one cannot help wondering why people should have put up for so long with governments exercising an exclusive power over two thousand years that was regularly used to exploit and defraud them. This can be explained only by the myth” that government money was necessary “becoming so firmly established that it did not occur even to the professional students of these matters…ever to question it. But once the validity of the established doctrine is doubted its foundation is rapidly seen to be fragile.”

Governments reap incredible profits from debasing the currency, but the rigged game works only if people have no alternative but to play it. The political purpose of legal tender and banking laws is to grant a monopoly to the state, which permits the redistribution of wealth and power from average people upward to the elite of society. Fiat money and banking remains fragile, however, because the system relies on people either not understanding the dynamics or not having a choice. Hayek wonders why public understanding is so elusive. Why was “a government monopoly of the provision of money…universally regarded as indispensable” and what would happen “if the provision of money were thrown open to the competition of private concerns supplying different currencies?”

With eerie prescience, Hayek argues for currencies developed by entrepreneurs who innovate new forms of money just as they innovate in other areas. One of the drawbacks of government’s monopoly is that it imposes a freeze on the sort of invention that now runs free in crypto. The voluntaryist historian Carl Watner observes, “No one can tell in advance what form these monies might take because no one can know for sure what choices individuals would make or what new technologies might be discovered. Laws forcing people to use the Federal Reserve System money have frozen monetary developments at a certain stage…Just imagine if Congress had protected the Post Office by passing laws that would have prevented people from communicating via the internet. We would never have experienced the marvels of e-mail.”

The late Austrian economist Murray Rothbard also wrestles with the question of “why do people so vigorously resist private currencies?” His book For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto advances an explanation. “If the government and only the government had had a monopoly of the shoe manufacturing and retailing business, how would most of the public treat the libertarian who now came along to advocate that the government get out of the shoe business and throw it open to private enterprise?” Rothbard predicts that the skeptics would attack the libertarian for depriving them of the only possible source of shoes—the government. People are thoroughly indoctrinated to believe that daily life cannot function without the state and fiat.

Hayek and Rothbard are unusual among free-market economists in their embrace of private money and monetary systems. Even laissez-faire zealots rarely champion free-market currencies or private banking. Instead, they debate marginal issues such as fractional reserve and other reforms they think will improve the existing system. Or they argue for the restoration of a gold standard as though it were a panacea. But if a gold standard were applied to fiat, the system would still require people to trust the government and banks. This means trusting both institutions to act against their own interests, which they have historically neglected to do.

The modern neglect of free-market money and banking is odd because 19th century radical individualists focused intensely on the importance of private money and private banking to personal freedom. They placed a primal emphasis on the right of every individual to create his own currency and to function as his own bank. It was a natural right as important as freedom of speech or of religion. The pivotal individualist Benjamin Tucker believed that the right to issue private currency was so important that it could destroy the State all by itself. His reasoning: The money monopoly, including control of credit, was how the State sustained itself and robbed average people not merely of wealth but also of economic opportunity.

Two specific events sculpted the approach that the early individualist-anarchists adopted toward the monetary monopoly. One was the Panic of 1837 that tipped the United States into recession until the mid-1840s. Commonly cited causes of the Panic include a collapsing land bubble and a sharp fall in cotton prices. Blame is also placed at the feet of President Andrew Jackson for vetoing the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States and precipitating an unfortunate chain of economic events. Drawing on the work of Professor of Economics Peter Temin, Rothbard disputes this interpretation.

First, he [Temin] points out that the price inflation really began earlier, when wholesale prices reached a trough of 82 in July 1830 and then rose by 20.7 percent in three years to reach 99 in the fall of 1833. The reason for the price rise is simple: The total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $159 million in 1833, an increase of 45.9 percent, or an annual rise of 15.3 percent. Breaking the figures down further, the total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $155 million a year and a half later, a spectacular expansion of 35 percent. Unquestionably, this monetary expansion was spurred by the still-flourishing Bank of the United States, which increased its notes and deposits from January 1830 to January 1832 from a total of $29 million to $42.1 million, a rise of 45.2 percent. Thus, the price and money inflation in the first few years of the 1830s were again sparked by the expansion of the still-dominant central bank.

Arguably, the Panic began in May 1837 when banks in New York City announced they would not redeem commercial paper for specie at full face value. Of the approximately 800 banks in America, all but six ceased at one point or another to redeem banknotes and deposits for gold or silver coins. Suspicion and hatred of traditional banks and government-issued money soared, with radicals scrutinizing alternate systems.

The other event dramatically to impact the radical fever from monetary reform was the Civil War for which the North financed its fighting through Legal Tender Acts and the National Banking Act of 1863.

The radicals did not merely theorize; they experimented with private currencies and new economic models. Their efforts are fascinating, but they are also cautionary tales. A major problem for 19th-century individualist-anarchism was the movement’s general acceptance of a link between sound money and the labor theory of value. This theory states that the true value of a good or service is based on the labor required to produce it rather than the price at which a seller and buyer are willing to exchange. In short, a good has intrinsic and not subjective value. (More on this in the section on the Regression Theorem.) Happily, their main economic goal was the abolition of the “money monopoly.” The term referred to three different but interacting forms of monopoly: banking, the charging of interest, and the privileged issuance of currency. The abolition of state power over currency was the focus, and they eschewed the use of force to implement their own schemes.

Josiah Warren provided a real-world example of what was meant by a currency that rested on the labor theory of value. Credited with being the first American anarchist, Warren tested his specific solution to the money monopoly through a Time Store from which he issued “Labor Notes.” In 1827, the business opened with $300 worth of groceries and dry goods that were offered at a 7 percent markup from Warren’s own costs in order to cover expenses such as overhead. This was before groceries were prepackaged or preweighed, and it was usual for buyers to bargain with the shopkeeper rather than pay a posted price. One of

Warren’s innovations was to post prices, which drove costs lower because transactions consumed less time. The customer paid in traditional money for the goods and paid with a Labor Note to compensate Warren for his time. The Labor Note obliged the customer to provide Warren with an equivalent amount of his time. If the buyer was a seamstress, for example, the Labor Note committed her to render to Warren X units of time to produce clothing. Warren’s goal was to establish an economy—or to establish a proof of principle, at least—in which profit was based on the exchange of time and labor. The Labor Notes were circulated and traded widely with in the community.

To some degree, Warren succeeded. People traveled from a hundred miles away to avail themselves of the Time Store’s low prices. After a few years, he declared the experiment to be a success and closed the store. Whether the Labor Notes were a success is questionable, however. The store itself may well have succeeded due to its low prices, not to the Notes. Whichever explanation is true, it is difficult to see how this novel currency could function in dense populations or on a grander scale of commerce. Few people today would be convinced of the viability of private money based on the Time Store experiment.

What could convince the public and economists that private currencies work as well or better than government-issued ones? Going back a bit further in American history is a good place to start because the future is always based on the past.

21Shares AG, a Zurich-based investment provider, is launching what is being dubbed as the world’s first Polkadot exchange-traded product, or ETP.

The DOT ETP will be listed on the Swiss exchange SIX on Thursday, February 4, said the company in a statement on Tuesday. DOT is the native token of the Polkadot network.

DOT has since been added to 21Shares’ Crypto Basket ETP (HODL), which tracks five major assets including bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH). Since its addition on Jan. 29, DOT now accounts for 27% of the product behind BTC at 50%.

Hany Rashwan, chief executive officer of 21Shares, said the firm has seen “unprecedented demand” from institutional investors wanting exposure to crypto-assets. He stated that demand for its range of crypto ETPs has soared 500% since the third quarter of 2020, but there has been “a recent surge in interest” for DOT.

“After investors purchase their first bitcoins through our ETPs, there is a natural transition to invest in other crypto assets,” Rashwan detailed.

“We benefit from trusted partners for the liquidity provision and upon continued institutional demand, we are launching the DOT ETP to give investors a safe, regulated, and easy way to obtain exposure to this exciting new blockchain technology,” he added.

Rashwan revealed that 21Shares, an issuer of exchange-traded products, is planning to add up to three ETPs over the next 3 months. He said European investors have been approaching the company to launch new products.

Created by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Polkadot is a cross-blockchain that enables transfers of any type of data or asset, not just tokens. It is also used as an electronic payment system.

DOT is now the world’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market capitalization of $16.55 billion, according to data from markets.Bitcoin.com. At the time of writing, DOT is trading at $17.22, up 8% over the past 24 hours.

Ukraine’s government-owned nuclear power plant picked a firm to build a massive data center in Rivne for cryptocurrency mining operations. After a bidding process, Energoatom chose Kyiv Energy Construction Company to handle the nuclear plant crypto mining project.

Nuclear Power Plant Operator Expects to Launch the Data Center in 2022

According to official documents, the data center will be based in the Rivne nuclear power plant, after the construction firm got 8.92 million Hryvnia ($317,620) in funding. The only competitor in the bidding was Ukrenergobudproek. However, they allegedly made an expensive offer, said the regional news outlet Forklog.

The Kyiv Energy Construction Company expects to finish the data center building by August 31, 2022. Per the announcement, the contractor is required to send the documentation that details the whole process. It includes “host state registers, electronic archives, and computing facilities.”

In terms of technical details, the nuclear power plant has a capacity of 2,657 megawatts, and it was built in the late 1970s. Also, the operations of the state-owned nuclear facilities started at the beginning of 1980.

In October 2020, Energoatom also signed a memorandum with a subsidiary of crypto mining giant Bitfury. With the new data center, local media outlets believe Bitfury miners could move their operations into the power plant’s facilities.

Ukraine’s Interest Towards Building Crypto Mining Data Centers in Nuclear Plants

The deal between Energoatom and Kyiv Energy Construction Company is not a surprising move. In fact, the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine asked Energoatom in May 2020 to conduct research to assess crypto mining’s feasibility at their nuclear plants.

As an anecdotal fact in terms of crypto mining in Ukrainian nuclear plants, the nation’s Security Service found illegal crypto mining equipment in a nuclear power plant in 2019.

The installation’s illegal mining rigs were found in the Southern region of Ukraine. Moreover, the investigations determined that such illegal equipment breached a “state secret.”

Global music distribution service Ditto has unveiled the latest addition to its service lineup for musicians with a blockchain-based financing platform named Opulous.

Opulous Peer-to-Peer Lending Platform Serves as a Loan Pool Designed to Help Artists

Ditto continues its efforts to improve the value chain for artists. Unlike other decentralized finance (defi) protocols, Opulous reflects asset-based lending, which bridges the physical and digital worlds. The Opulous’ defi lending mechanism, which is being developed on the Algorand public blockchain, leverages music copyrights’ tangibility through a smart contract setup that automatically handles principal and interest payments along with distributions to investors.

For musicians already receiving royalties, this presents a unique opportunity to monetize their assets or contribute to the pool to stake other artists. When seeking capital, artists can access funds by collateralizing loans from Opulous’ Music Copyright Pools with their music royalties.

Besides digitizing music as an asset class, the move will invite more democratized participation from artists and investors seeking to gain a foothold in the music industry, which is undergoing tremendous annual growth and expected to double in size by 2030. Artists benefit from interest rates starting as low as 4%, while investors in the copyright pools can add exposure to music royalties as an asset class for 10% returns per annum.

Per Ditto CEO Lee Parsons,

Opulous cuts out traditional banking, providing musicians with a platform with minimal interest payments, while giving investors the chance to stake a claim in one of the most exciting and fastest-growing financial industries in the world.

Ditto, which has already processed more than $1 billion in royalties for its 250,000-plus users, sees industry revenues doubling in the next ten years, building a compelling investment thesis. In keeping with Opulous’ mission to democratize musicians’ financial access, users outside the Ditto ecosystem are welcome to join the peer-to-peer lending framework.

Opulous has raised $1.5 million in funding to-date from BASIC, Borderless Capital, Kosmos Capital, Somesing, and TrustVerse. Roll out of the platform’s minimum viable product (MVP) is anticipated in two months as development proceeds.

Elastos, which built its decentralized application (dapp) platform and currency (ELA) to protect users’ digital assets and creations, will be among the first token staking partners for Opulous’ proof-of-stake consensus protocol. Opulous, in concert with Elastos, will allow investors to stake their Elastos (ELA) coins within the Music Copyright Pools.

According to Clarence Liu, the VP of Development at the Elastos Foundation,

Elastos and Ditto Music have been researching how blockchain can address fundamental inefficiencies in the music industry. Access to funding – which Opulous will address – is only the tip of the iceberg.

“Our collaboration has much more in the pipeline and our community is definitely set on using the forward momentum sparked by recent world events to introduce new users to the decentralized internet ideals set by Elastos,” Liu concludes.

During the last year, Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem has grown exponentially to form a multi Billion Dollar market. As Decentralized Finance expands, it becomes more and more relevant to have cross-chain connections that enable crypto assets to flow instantly and seamlessly across blockchain networks. These make it possible for DeFi platforms to be an effective alternative to centralized exchanges. Today, pNetwork launches the first EOS to Ethereum cross-chain connection to enable the EOS crypto asset to be moved into Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem.

EOS on Ethereum

EOS, the native token on the EOS blockchain, is a top20 cryptocurrency by market cap and the engine powering one of the most active dApps ecosystems. The asset counts over $ 3.5 Billion in daily trading volumes, figuring as the 9th most traded cryptocurrency. At present, only a fraction of the total is happening in a decentralized fashion.

While the DeFi ecosystem on EOS continues to grow, it has not yet reached Ethereum’s size. The latter powers Billions in daily trading volumes, Uniswap being the largestlarges liquidity protocol in existence and the fourth biggest DeFi protocol in terms of Total Value Locked.

Following the delivery of 26 bridges connecting six different blockchain protocols, including the cross-chain transfer of popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin, pNetwork launches today a new cross-chain connection that brings EOS to Ethereum.

As the first tokenised version of EOS, pEOS makes the asset compatible with Ethereum’s DeFi. This creates a benefit on both sides, enabling Ethereum’s DeFi protocols to expand their range of assets supported and granting EOS the option to be traded in a decentralized fashion as well as being supported as a collateral type by major Ethereum-based landing platforms.

Cross-chain connections are critical for a variety of use-cases, from NFTs to market making to decentralized indexes such as PieDAO’s Pies. pNetwork-powered asset tokenisation on Ethereum enables such indexes to represent the entire crypto market.

All pTokenised assets are pegged 1:1 to their underlying asset and are available for automated minting or redeeming on the pTokens dApp. In addition, pTokens are supported on a variety of DeFi protocols, decentralized exchanges and wallets on a growing number of blockchains.

Making Ethereum and EOS dApps Interoperable

Ethereum and EOS are two of the most active ecosystems for dApps, counting thousands of users each. By connecting these two blockchain environments, pNetwork aims to support the growth and development of decentralized applications such as lending/borrowing, trading, derivatives, and more. Acting as a cross-chain highway for cryptocurrencies to frictionlessly move from one blockchain to another, pNetwork powers the first bi-directional connection between the Ethereum and EOS blockchains.

Users on either blockchain are now able to interact with both ecosystems without ever leaving their blockchain of choice. Projects from both Ethereum and EOS communities have developed building blocks to create the next-generation financial system – with the connection between these two, users will find an even more powerful DeFi ecosystem.

By leveraging pNetwork’s cross-chain solution, dApps on the two blockchain platforms now have the opportunity to interoperate. Each ecosystem leveraging its counterpart’s strengths ultimately creates a benefit on both sides and sets the basis for sustainable growth. The presence of an EOS/ETH decentralized trading pair both with Ethereum’s and EOS’s decentralized finance, for example, makes it possible for market makers to arbitrage between the two blockchains. This results in a more liquid decentralized market for both assets.

As the so-called ‘meme coin’ is actively making the headlines within the crypto sphere, a publicly-traded company is joining the dogecoin frenzy. Kronos Advanced Technology announced they’ll start accepting dogecoin as one of its payment methods.

Kronos Also Accepts Other Cryptocurrencies Such as Bitcoin and Ether

According to the announcement, the Los Angeles-based firm is adding dogecoin (DOGE) to its accepted payment form. In fact, customers will be able to purchase air purifiers, and personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies via the meme coin.

Adopting dogecoin as a payment method was not as part as just of a crypto adoption-driven maneuver. The company praised the popularity of the token and its uniqueness within the industry.

Also, Kronos pointed out that dogecoins transactions’ speed is a positive note for the Shiba Inu inspired meme token. So far, the company accepts several cryptos as payment methods, such as bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), litecoin (LTC), among others.

Expanding N95 Mask Market Into the Dogecoin Community

Michael Rubinov, president of Kronos Advanced Technologies, commented on the company’s stance towards cryptocurrencies:

In the last ten years, much has been said about how cryptocurrency will revolutionize payments, services, businesses and will change the world the way we know it. Cryptocurrency has changed e-commerce: as more and more people now shop online. Cryptocurrency gives customers more reasons to utilize the convenience of online shopping, as it mitigates the risk of fraud for both vendors and shoppers.

By adopting dogecoin as a form of payment, Kronos also expect to market N95 masks to the entire meme coin community on Reddit, which has grown over 670,000 members. The company also praised the fact that Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk endorses dogecoin as one of his favorite cryptocurrencies.

Despite the recent frenzy seen in the meme coin, the latest markets.Bitcoin.com data shows that dogecoin is exchanging hands at $0.0317, down -20.43% on Tuesday. The market capitalization still stands at $4.08 billion.

Spacex and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been trying to get to the bottom of what happened with the popular trading app Robinhood when it stopped people from buying shares of hot stocks, like Gamestop. The shares of these stocks became popular due to the Wallstreetbets movement.

Elon Musk Says People Want the Truth From Robinhood

During an interview on The Good Time Show via the Clubhouse app Sunday night, Elon Musk grilled the CEO of trading app Robinhood, Vlad Tenev, over the company’s decision to restrict hot stocks last week, including Gamestop. On Friday, Robinhood also restricted crypto trading, citing “extraordinary market conditions.”

“What happened last week? Why can’t people buy the Gamestop shares? The people demand an answer and they want to know the details and the truth,” Musk said.

Tenev began by explaining the structure of his company. “Robinhood is actually a couple of companies,” he described. Robinhood Financial processes trades, Robinhood Securities clears and settles the trades, and Robinhood Crypto which deals with crypto trades.

The Robinhood CEO detailed that last Wednesday, his platform experienced “unprecedented volume” as “a lot of these so-called meme stocks were going viral on social media and people were joining Robinhood” to buy these stocks. Consequently, the company “received a file” from the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) Thursday morning at about 3:30 AM PST. It requested Robinhood to “put up money to the NSCC based on some factors,” including the volatility of certain securities. Tenev clarified that “this is the equities business so it’s based on stock trading and not options trading or anything else,” elaborating:

They gave us a file with a deposit and the request was around $3 billion dollars which is about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is.

Musk interrupted Tenev, questioning: “Why is that so high? It sounds like this is an unprecedented increase in demand for capital. What formula did they use to calculate that?”

Tenev replied: “We don’t have the full details. It’s a little bit of an opaque formula but there’s a component called the VAR of it, which is the Value at Risk, and that’s based on kind of some fairly quantitative things … and then there’s a special component which is discretionary so that kind of acts as a multiplier.” Tenev also noted that up until that point, his company “has raised a little bit around two billion dollars in total venture capital,” so the request was “a big number.”

The Tesla CEO interrupted again, asking: “What everyone wants to know is did something maybe shady go down here? It seems weird that you’d get a sudden $10 billion demand in the morning … suddenly out of nowhere.” Tenev swiftly corrected Musk that the number was $3 billion. The Robinhood CEO then emphasized:

I wouldn’t impugn shadiness to it or anything like that, and actually the NSCC was reasonable subsequent to this. They worked with us to actually lower it. It was unprecedented activity.

Musk abruptly asked Tenev: “Is there anyone holding you hostage right now?” Tenev chuckled and replied: “No, no, I’m okay. Thanks for asking.” Both laughed.

The Robinhood CEO proceeded to explain what happened, calling the experience “nerve-wrecking.” He said after receiving the request for $3 billion, his chief operating officer called up someone higher up at the NSCC to discuss what to do. “There was another call and they lowered it to something like $1.4 billion from $3 billion,” Tenev reiterated that it was still a high number. His company then proposed a plan to the NSCC of “marking these volatile stocks that were kind of driving the activity position-closing only.”

Then, at about 5 to 5:30 AM PST, before the market opened, the NSCC came back and reduced the deposit requirement to $700 million, “which we then deposited and paid promptly,” Tenev emphasized. Acknowledging that the move was bad for customers, the Robinhood CEO said, “We had no choice, in this case. We had to conform to our regulatory capital requirements and so the team did what they could to make sure we were available for customers.”

The Spacex CEO further questioned: “Who controls this organization, this clearinghouse?” Tenev replied: “It’s a consortium. It’s not quite a government agency. I don’t really know the details of all of that.” Nonetheless, he emphasized that “To be fair … I think there was legitimate sort of turmoil in the markets … so there probably is some amount of extra risk in the system that warrants higher requirements so it’s not entirely unreasonable.” He noted that lots of other brokers were in the same situation and had to restrict the same activity.

“So it sounds like this organization calls you up and they basically have a gun to your head: either hand over this money or else,” the Spacex CEO summarized, elaborating:

Basically, what people are wondering is did you sell your clients down the river or did you have no choice. If you had no choice, that’s understandable but then we got to find out why you had no choice and who are these people that are saying you have no choice.

“I think that’s fair. We have to comply with these requirements. Financial institutions have requirements,” Tenev responded. Nonetheless, he suggested that it would be helpful to know the formula the NSCC uses to calculate these requirements so companies can plan better.

Musk proceeded to ask about whether there was outside pressure forcing Robinhood to take the action it did. Tenev affirmed that there is “a rumor that Citadel or other market makers kind of pressured us into doing this.” However, he clarified, “that’s just false,” emphasizing that “this was a clearinghouse decision and it was just based on the capital requirements so from our perspective Citadel and other market makers weren’t involved in that.”

During the same Clubhouse interview, Elon also revealed that he is a supporter of bitcoin and should have bought the cryptocurrency eight years ago. He believes that bitcoin is on the verge of getting broad acceptance by traditional finance people. On Monday, Robinhood raised another $2.4 billion from shareholders after it secured $1 billion last Thursday.

PRESS RELEASE. The AdGram service was founded a year ago and is currently the largest advertising exchange in Telegram.

AdGram helps brands place large advertising volumes in channels and groups quickly and efficiently. Channels and groups benefit from expansion of their audience, it is easy to find advertisers and increase the earnings from advertising placements via AdGram.

Over the last 12 months, the service has gained a huge experience in communications with both advertisers and administrators from different countries, which has highlighted issues with settlements in multiple currencies. After overcoming these obstacles, it was decided that cryptocurrency could be the key to solving this problem.

With the termination of the Telegram team’s work on the TON project in May 2020 (the messenger lost one of its monetization methods), Free TON was launched which took over the development and popularization of TON Crystal using the open source code from the original TON. The uniqueness of FreeTON is that it is one of the few projects where all the tokens belong to the community and it is developing as a decentralized autonomous organization.

The potential of the underlying technology and the growth of the community inspired AdGram and in October 2020 they partnered with the FreeTON Community and fully integrated Crystal as a means of payment. Synergy with FreeTON made it possible to take a big step towards using cryptocurrencies as a single, simple and clear means of payment.

The ability to pay with tokens for advertising in Telegram creates a powerful use case for the TON Crystal token. Huge and constantly growing volume of the advertising market is vital for tokenomics as it creates supply and demand for market participants, thereby increasing the liquidity of the token itself.

For administrators and advertisers transactions in TON Crystal is simple, convenient and fast! It also solves the problem of collecting details for transfers in various currencies, and avoids paying banking fees.

Advertising on Telegram and the FreeTON blockchain, which is the successor of Durov’s original (but never happened Durov’s TON), create a strong and impact-resistant synergy of mutual benefits. This shows markets and communities can develop in a self-regulated environment.

PRESS RELEASE. CEX.IO LOAN experiences massive institutional demand for its crypto-backed lending service, with 41% of customers requesting to borrow cash against Bitcoin, 53% against Ethereum, and 6% against DeFi tokens.

Crypto-backed lending service CEX.IO LOAN that launched in October 2020 in select global jurisdictions, has been experiencing major demand, receiving over $100 million worth of loan requests to date. While the service has been widely popular among retail investors, most of the platform’s loan requests came from institutional investors.

According to CEX.IO LOAN, such an increase in demand can be attributed to the institutionalization of the cryptocurrency industry. Institutional investors, who have cryptocurrencies in their possession, regard it as a potential collateral for borrowing funds and actively utilise it as such. The borrowed funds are then used for further investment purposes.

In addition to featuring cutting-edge security and advanced anti-fraud measures, CEX.IO Group operates a regulated service, which has been licensed as a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) provider by the Gibraltar Financial Service Commission (GFSC) since last year. In addition to this, the Government of Gibraltar recently granted CEX.IO Limited a Money Lender License, allowing the firm to extend its ecosystem of regulated services with CEX.IO LOAN.

Institutional clients also prefer the company’s digital asset-backed lending service due to the convenience offered to users. On the CEX.IO LOAN platform, customers can borrow cash against their cryptocurrency assets in a quick and simple manner, without having to deal with credit checks or any unnecessary paperwork. To access the company’s instant crypto-backed lending service, new users have to open an account at the digital asset exchange and pass the mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML checks.

CEX.IO LOAN serves various cryptocurrency market participants, from retail investors, traders, and HODLers to startups, entrepreneurs, and large enterprises. As part of a flexible crypto-backed lending service, users can borrow any amount between $500 and $100,000 at competitive interest rates starting at 8.75% per year. Loan duration ranging from seven days to one year.

Currently, retail users can borrow funds against their Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) assets. Based on the company’s data, the feature has already experienced high demand from VIP clients, with 41% of all CEX.IO LOAN customers borrowing cash against Bitcoin (BTC), 53% against Ethereum (ETH), and 6% against DeFi tokens.

The company has recently introduced a VIP-exclusive feature to offer flexible lending conditions and the ability to use decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens as collateral for institutional clients on the crypto-backed lending platform.

Furthermore, to best serve institutional customers, the requests and queries of VIP clients are handled individually by dedicated personal managers on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Interestingly, 14% of CEX.IO VIP customers have already asked their personal managers about borrowing funds via the crypto-backed lending service.

“As institutional investors find the digital asset industry increasingly attractive, it’s a pleasure to serve them with our enterprise-grade instant crypto-backed loan platform. Security, convenience, and compliance are key priorities for corporate clients, which are features that we have been providing to all our clients in the rapidly growing CEX.IO ecosystem. Most importantly, we want to provide institutional clients with the best service. For that reason, VIP clients enjoy exclusive benefits, such as dedicated personal managers and flexible lending options, on the CEX.IO LOAN platform,” Anton Chashchin, Commercial Director for the CEX.IO LOAN service, stated.

In the announcement, the firm revealed further details about the size of the funds clients borrow on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Based on the company’s data, while retail investors borrow $1,400 on average, VIP clients request larger-sized loans that vary in size, with the typical amount being $1 million or higher.

Institutional clients do not just borrow more but also need the funds for more extended periods which usually range between 6 and 12 months. According to the company, this phenomenon indicates a long-term strategy for VIP clients to manage their assets.

PRESS RELEASE. PARSIQ, a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform connecting on-chain and off-chain applications in real-time, announced that its PRQ token is now listed on OKEx with USDT base pair.

Please take note of the following go-live schedule:

PRQ Deposit : 07:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Spot Trading : PRQ / USDT : 10:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Withdrawal : 10:00 January 29, 2021 (UTC)

PARSIQ is a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform that serves as a multi-level bridge between blockchains and off-chain applications. PARSIQ’s features automate the blockchain analytics and monitoring process, providing customizable workflows with real-time intelligence.

Developers and individual users can transform the blockchain data to their favorite off-chain application or web service.

Among the obvious use cases is monitoring the wallets of traders and ordinary users. Among the non-obvious are complex system integrations for financial institutions and DeFi projects that use the PARSIQ infrastructure to improve security, conduct audits, comply with regulatory requirements, AML, and expand their workflows in other ways.

The infrastructure underneath PARSIQ’s user interface is built with their proprietary programming language ParsiQL, and its users’ benefits are multiplying with each supported integration.

PRQ Token

PARSIQ Token (PRQ) is an essential piece of the PARSIQ platform that co-exists with FIAT payments for using its services. Payments within the platform that are made in PRQ tokens guarantee a discounted rate. During the first Epoch when PRQ tokens are used as payment for running Smart-Triggers users receive higher execution limits, unlock transport methods, and are able to propose features that can be added to the platform.

In October 2020, the PARSIQ team released plans for Epoch 2.0.

#1. Public Projects

With Public Projects users can subscribe to existing PARSIQ Projects that were pre-made by other users. By paying in PRQ, users that have subscribed to the Public Project will incentivize the creators to create interesting, complex, and more important – problem-solving projects.

#2. User Data and PRQ

Every single monitoring target (primitive of type address, a struct with the field of address type, table row) would require 1 PRQ to hold after the implementation. It means that if there are 1000 addresses (960 in the table as rows, 30 as primitives, 10 in the structs) then the User would need 1000 PRQ on the connected Ethereum Account balance.

#3. IQ Protocol

IQ Protocol will allow risk-free PRQ lending and collateral-less borrowing. Risk-free PRQ lending means that PRQ is not transferred from the lender’s address to the borrower’s address. Details on the algorithm are available in the dedicated explainer on PARSIQ’s blog.

#4. PRQBoost

PRQ Boost is a liquidity boost program to incentivize PRQ/ETH liquidity providers on Uniswap, which goes with the PRQBOOST utility tokens to increase rewards for liquidity providers.

PARSIQ is actively working to partner with major layer 1 blockchain protocols to expand the range of blockchain integrations and give projects that build on those protocols the ability to monitor and automate workflows between blockchain and off-chain.

PRESS RELEASE. YFX, the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts has just launched, adding an important piece to the DeFi money legos, and creating a direct competition against CEX on derivatives trading.

The most traded Bitcoin product in centralized exchanges is Bitcoin futures, which is 10 times bigger than spot trading in terms of the trading volume. But in DEX, spot trading platforms like Uniswap are occupying a large portion of the total trading volume, and there is not a single decentralized futures trading platform that could reach even 1/10 of Uniswap’s trading volume. What stops decentralized futures trading platforms from becoming 10 times bigger than Uniswap? Why are decentralized futures trading platforms performing worse than their centralized counterparts?

The main reason is that decentralized futures exchanges don’t currently provide an attractive futures product to compete with centralized futures exchanges. For instance, centralized futures exchanges like BitMex can provide 100x leverage on Bitcoin futures trading. On the other hand, decentralized futures exchanges like dYdX only offer 10x leverage. None of the decentralized exchanges can keep up with the 100x leverage offering from centralized exchanges.

YFX Descartes V1 uses QIC-AMM and a system de-risk mechanism to migrate perpetual futures trading from CEX to DEX without reducing the trading leverage, which makes YFX the first DEX that could offer 100x leverage on a perpetual contract. You can do everything on YFX that you can do on BitMex or OKEx. YFX is poised to compete directly against established centralized exchanges. YFX Descartes V1 runs on the TRON MainNet, for faster transaction times and cheaper gas fees compared to Ethereum. The YFX team is also working on Ethereum’s Layer 2 solution to provide pragmatic perpetual trading on DEX. YFX team plans to launch their DEX on Huobi Heco and Ethereum Test net in Q1, 2021.

About YFX

YFX is the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts. YFX Descartes V1 launched on the TRON MainNet, and all trades are held and processed by smart contracts. The main goal of the YFX team, which is formed by a group of engineers who have years of experience working on trading systems and blockchain, is to build a DEX that can compete with CEX on derivative trading.

The Wall Street Bets saga, an incredibly ridiculous story about a group of amateur Reddit investors who beat career Wall Street hedge funds at their own game, is to be made into a movie.

According to a report by online news site Deadline on Jan. 31, Metro Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) won the rights to produce the film in a bidding war involving major Hollywood movie houses.

The movie is to be based on a book proposed by author Ben Mezrich. Mezrich’s previous work, “The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding Of Facebook, a Tale Of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal,” was adapted into the motion picture “The Social Network.”

The title to his planned latest book offering is called “The Antisocial Network,” said the report, quoting sources familiar with the development. The book is expected to go out to publishers later this February, it said.

However, it is not yet clear what shape or structure the movie will take. MGM’s Michael DeLuca will produce the film. DeLuca also produced the Academy-Award winning The Social Network. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss will executive produce via their Winklevoss Pictures production company.

The Wall Street Bets group noticed that major hedge funds on Wall Street had been placing short bets against companies they considered to be dying. The funds particularly targeted Gamestop, the world’s largest video game retailer, continually shorting the company’s shares.

But the Redditors saw an opportunity to make profit and collectively bet the other way, buying shares and stock options. This resulted in the value of the Gamestop shares soaring by more than 2,600% in January.

Hedge funds that had shorted the stock incurred losses running into several billions of dollars. One fund, Melvin Capital, reportedly lost up to $7 billion to the “short squeeze” in January, forcing it to restructure its investment portfolio to ensure a faster escape in future “squeezes.”

The Reddit traders also extended the pump to a few other stocks considered to be dying, including AMC (which climbed over 900% in January), as well as Nokia and Blackberry. This surge of activity resulted in a major controversy when the trading app Robinhood began restricting trade on certain stocks.

Alongside the cryptocurrency’s meteoric climb over the back half of 2020 and early 2021, a curious phenomenon has unfolded; heightened profit-taking and conversion to fiat currencies. Data collected by Simplex, a fiat-crypto gateway, underscores this seemingly paradoxical development.

A Curious Race to Convert Crypto to Fiat Has Accompanied Bitcoin’s Latest Drive Higher

Sharing exclusive data with Bitcoin.com, Simplex cofounder and chief analytics officer Netanel Kabala says:

While the international press coverage of Bitcoin’s rally has caused a swathe of new users to flock to the industry and buy-in, outflows have been equally significant. Of the total amount of cryptocurrency sold in the last six months, 43% was off ramped in December alone.

A quick look at Google Trends for the term ‘Bitcoin’ echoes these developments, especially now that new equity instruments like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and big-name funds like Blackrock are adding exposure and raising crypto awareness.

Still, given the increased ability to quickly convert crypto and withdraw in fiat currencies, the uptick in funds leaving the ecosystem is astonishing. Part of this can be attributed to the growing fungibility of cryptocurrency, primarily helped by the support of players like Simplex, which empowers users to buy, sell, and spend crypto through Visa partnerships.

Although some of the latest rally’s onlookers have decried the rapid rise in crypto valuations as proof that a bubble is forming in this nascent asset class, others within the industry see the development as a harbinger of times to come. One of the areas this is most apparent is altcoins.

Data compiled by Simplex illustrates that as Bitcoin prices have leveled off above $30,000, daily purchases of altcoins have risen by approximately 65%. More interestingly, the data highlights that newer users account for nearly 20% of this volume, marking a sharp increase in the number of novice retail investors expanding and diversifying their exposure within the ecosystem.

Poloniex, one of the top 20 global cryptocurrency exchanges, which has adopted Simplex’s platform, has experienced these results firsthand. Karen McHenry, Poloniex’s Director of Product, attributes this development to greater access within the ecosystem, especially with Simplex’s buy option, which promotes instant account funding alongside the heightened ability to cash out quickly.

She also doesn’t see the ability to more quickly convert from crypto to fiat as harming interest despite the eyepopping amounts taken off exchanges.

It may sound surprising, but adding the ‘sell’ option actually has a positive impact on the number of crypto transactions too.

Though this easy offramp and soaring volume of sell orders might seem negative for prices, it can also be viewed as a healthy reflection of the ecosystem’s growing use cases. Besides making it easier to exit and enter, growing areas like decentralized finance (defi) and greater fungibility all contribute to a cryptocurrency’s value proposition.

As institutions begin lining up to add exposure as retail accumulation climbs, Bitcoin momentum may actually accelerate, and by extension, lift the altcoins sought after by the newcomers seeking opportunities outside the seminal crypto coin.

McHenry adds:

If the bull market can maintain its momentum, some of these BTC profits will flow into altcoins, which are particularly popular among retail investors. This creates a positive feedback loop, with traders who turn a profit prone to telling their friends about crypto, which brings more investment into the space.

This past week, another social media trend started on the Reddit forum r/wallstreetbets, which aims to initiate a large silver short squeeze in order to push the price of the precious metal to $1,000 per ounce. However, the silver squeeze trend comes with controversy, as numerous wallstreetbets supporters believe hedge funds like Melvin Capital and Citadel are behind the silver push.

The Controversial ‘Silver Squeeze’

During the last week, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the wallstreetbets (WSB) saga taking place on social media forums and the infamous subreddit r/wallstreetbets. Since the mega short squeeze on the Gamestop (GME) shares, the squeeze maneuver has also spilled into a number of other stocks. This week, shares from the Russell 3000 Index (RUA) were targeted including tickers like NOK, GOGO, AMCX, and FIZZ. But the trend didn’t stop there, as one post, in particular, had called for a “silver squeeze.” The WSB Reddit post called for the silver squeeze to push the price of silver from $25 per ounce to $1,000.

Now since the post was published, the Reddit admins in charge of moderating r/wallstreetbets removed the post. But that was long after the message was made viral by the participants discussing the pros and cons of attempting to squeeze silver. Now the reason people think the silver short squeeze post may be shady, is because a number of WSB Redditors believe the silver squeeze was invoked by the hedge funds losing money in order to cover their GME losses. There are a great number of Reddit posts warning that people should not participate in the silver short squeeze.

One post said:

Citadel is the 5th largest owner of [silver], it’s imperative we do not ‘squeeze’ it. These are hedge fund bots spamming awards.

The people who dislike the silver trend on WSB, have also warned that Melvin Capital Management is also a big silver holder. Unfortunately, it is hard to tell where the silver pump threads and posts are stemming from, as there are many free-market supporters who are fans of the precious metal sometimes referred to as the ‘poor man’s gold.’

Despite this, there are numbers of WSB fans and Redditors claiming the silver pump stemmed from hedge fund people and they believe there are imposters everywhere now. Some of these people are growing irrational, getting mad at anyone who posts about silver. Many WSB supporters might be feeling the pain from Gamestop Corp. shares dropping significantly on Monday.

Silver soars past $30 a troy ounce as Reddit-fuelled buying frenzy continues for 3rd day. #Silversqueeze pic.twitter.com/mLmasUBrq1 — Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) February 1, 2021

In Spite of Controversy, Something Is Sparking Silver Demand

Despite the speculation, some sort of demand was invoked when it comes to silver prices and obtaining physical bullion. For instance, if you are attempting to purchase an ounce or ounces of silver bullion online, the process is far more complicated now than it was last week. A large portion of bars and coins are either sold out or the prices are marked up considerably.

This is simple arbitrage. #Silver futures are 28.67. Silver Eagles on Apmex are $41.66, thats a 45% premium to futures. Obvious opportunity to buy futures & stand for delivery for a 35% discount on physical right? But when they don't have it, Futures = $41.66/oz. #silversqueeze — Jonathan #SILVERSQUEEZE Mergott (@Jmergz1985) February 1, 2021

All the American Eagles are sold out across a number of bullion dealers. On Sunday morning, a few big-name dealers have halted a great number of silver sales. News.Bitcoin.com’s most recent WSB report disclosed how SD Bullion sold nearly 10x the number of silver ounces than usual. People visiting bullion dealer websites like Provident, Apmex, and JD Bullion could see the unprecedented demand targeting physical silver.

“In the last week, we have seen a dramatic shift in Silver demand from our customers,” said Ken Lewis CEO of the bullion dealer Apmex. “For example, the ratio of ounces sold per day was running about two times earlier in the week and closer to four times the average demand by the end of the week,” Lewis added.

The Apmex CEO further stressed:

Once markets closed on Friday, we saw demand hit as much as six times a typical business day and more than 12 times a normal weekend day. Combined with the extremely high demand levels, we are also seeing a surge in new customers. On Saturday alone, we added as many new customers as we usually add in a week.

Additionally, the hashtag “#silversqueeze” has been trending throughout the United States and a few other countries on Twitter during the last 48 hours. By the late afternoon on Sunday, spot silver and futures traded at $27 per Troy ounce, and by Monday morning spot silver traded 7.7% higher at $29.76. The commodity hopped above the $30 region, and silver prices per ounce exchanged hands at $30.35 an ounce. One ounce of .999 silver is hovering in the $29 price handle at the time of publication

CHAPTER ONE: Listening to the Past

“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.” — Satoshi Nakamoto

The trusted third party problem has haunted modern financial systems and centralized exchanges because people require an intermediary to make them work. The third party’s good or bad motives become a defining aspect of the transaction, and the those who use the institutions are at the mercy of those intentions. This is especially true of the current system of state-issued money and central banking.

A trustless system avoids intermediaries and does not depend upon the intentions of participants; that is, the system functions in the same manner regardless of anyone’s intentions. The blockchain, with a transparent and immutable peer-to peer protocol, is called trustless because there is no corruptible intermediary upon whom exchanges must depend.

On a small scale, the trusted third party problem may always exist because a middleman is useful or necessary in some situations. If third parties offer competitive services on a free market, however, the damage of dishonesty or incompetence is limited. People can take their business elsewhere, report a swindler to watchdogs, warn others, and file a lawsuit.

An occasionally dishonest third party is not the problem Satoshi addresses. He speaks to the institutionalized corruption of government and central banks from which the average person could not escape by using a competitor or by suing. Almost everyone who works over the table, runs a business, buys or sells goods, accepts government benefits or pays taxes has had to accept a fiat that constantly plunges in value due to inflation. Almost everyone who uses credit, accepts checks, takes out loans, conducts commerce or does business abroad has needed to go through banks that steal like drunken muggers.

For average people, the situation used to seem hopeless because no legal, practical, and private alternative existed for transferring funds across considerable distance, including borders. Attempts to reform or remove the system also seemed doomed because it was inherently corrupt and self-serving. In fact, fiat and central banking were serving the purpose for which they had been established: financial control by elites. People’s need for money and exchange became their straitjackets.

Then Satoshi. Then the blockchain and crypto. A new concept of money was created in a form that cannot not be inflated; the number of bitcoins is fixed at 21 million divisible units. The supply can only decrease when coins are lost, as inevitably happens. Satoshi notes, “Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.” Bitcoin solved the fiat problem.

A new concept of financial transfer solved the third party problem, especially with regard to banks. Although peer-to-peer transactions involve a middleman or miner, no trust is required since the transaction is released only when “proof of work” is rendered, which consists of solving a complicated math problem. Arriving at a solution may be costly in computer power and time, but the solutions themselves are easy to verify. Satoshi comments, “With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.” The soundness and propriety of the blockchain’s protocol itself is assured by the use of open source that is visible to all and verifiable. The political outcome: A private currency and method of exchange freed people from financial oppression.

The idea of private currency itself is hardly new, however.

Precedent in Radical Individualist Theory

The late Friedrich Hayek is the most respected Austrian economist of the 20th century. His book The Denationalisation of Money: An Analysis of the Theory and Practice of Concurrent Currencies argues vigorously for private and competitive currencies to displace government-issued ones. Hayek ponders a key question. “When one studies the history of money one cannot help wondering why people should have put up for so long with governments exercising an exclusive power over two thousand years that was regularly used to exploit and defraud them. This can be explained only by the myth” that government money was necessary “becoming so firmly established that it did not occur even to the professional students of these matters…ever to question it. But once the validity of the established doctrine is doubted its foundation is rapidly seen to be fragile.”

Governments reap incredible profits from debasing the currency, but the rigged game works only if people have no alternative but to play it. The political purpose of legal tender and banking laws is to grant a monopoly to the state, which permits the redistribution of wealth and power from average people upward to the elite of society. Fiat money and banking remains fragile, however, because the system relies on people either not understanding the dynamics or not having a choice. Hayek wonders why public understanding is so elusive. Why was “a government monopoly of the provision of money…universally regarded as indispensable” and what would happen “if the provision of money were thrown open to the competition of private concerns supplying different currencies?”

With eerie prescience, Hayek argues for currencies developed by entrepreneurs who innovate new forms of money just as they innovate in other areas. One of the drawbacks of government’s monopoly is that it imposes a freeze on the sort of invention that now runs free in crypto. The voluntaryist historian Carl Watner observes, “No one can tell in advance what form these monies might take because no one can know for sure what choices individuals would make or what new technologies might be discovered. Laws forcing people to use the Federal Reserve System money have frozen monetary developments at a certain stage…Just imagine if Congress had protected the Post Office by passing laws that would have prevented people from communicating via the internet. We would never have experienced the marvels of e-mail.”

The late Austrian economist Murray Rothbard also wrestles with the question of “why do people so vigorously resist private currencies?” His book For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto advances an explanation. “If the government and only the government had had a monopoly of the shoe manufacturing and retailing business, how would most of the public treat the libertarian who now came along to advocate that the government get out of the shoe business and throw it open to private enterprise?” Rothbard predicts that the skeptics would attack the libertarian for depriving them of the only possible source of shoes—the government. People are thoroughly indoctrinated to believe that daily life cannot function without the state and fiat.

Hayek and Rothbard are unusual among free-market economists in their embrace of private money and monetary systems. Even laissez-faire zealots rarely champion free-market currencies or private banking. Instead, they debate marginal issues such as fractional reserve and other reforms they think will improve the existing system. Or they argue for the restoration of a gold standard as though it were a panacea. But if a gold standard were applied to fiat, the system would still require people to trust the government and banks. This means trusting both institutions to act against their own interests, which they have historically neglected to do.

The modern neglect of free-market money and banking is odd because 19th century radical individualists focused intensely on the importance of private money and private banking to personal freedom. They placed a primal emphasis on the right of every individual to create his own currency and to function as his own bank. It was a natural right as important as freedom of speech or of religion. The pivotal individualist Benjamin Tucker believed that the right to issue private currency was so important that it could destroy the State all by itself. His reasoning: The money monopoly, including control of credit, was how the State sustained itself and robbed average people not merely of wealth but also of economic opportunity.

Two specific events sculpted the approach that the early individualist-anarchists adopted toward the monetary monopoly. One was the Panic of 1837 that tipped the United States into recession until the mid-1840s. Commonly cited causes of the Panic include a collapsing land bubble and a sharp fall in cotton prices. Blame is also placed at the feet of President Andrew Jackson for vetoing the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States and precipitating an unfortunate chain of economic events. Drawing on the work of Professor of Economics Peter Temin, Rothbard disputes this interpretation.

First, he [Temin] points out that the price inflation really began earlier, when wholesale prices reached a trough of 82 in July 1830 and then rose by 20.7 percent in three years to reach 99 in the fall of 1833. The reason for the price rise is simple: The total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $159 million in 1833, an increase of 45.9 percent, or an annual rise of 15.3 percent. Breaking the figures down further, the total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $155 million a year and a half later, a spectacular expansion of 35 percent. Unquestionably, this monetary expansion was spurred by the still-flourishing Bank of the United States, which increased its notes and deposits from January 1830 to January 1832 from a total of $29 million to $42.1 million, a rise of 45.2 percent. Thus, the price and money inflation in the first few years of the 1830s were again sparked by the expansion of the still-dominant central bank.

Arguably, the Panic began in May 1837 when banks in New York City announced they would not redeem commercial paper for specie at full face value. Of the approximately 800 banks in America, all but six ceased at one point or another to redeem banknotes and deposits for gold or silver coins. Suspicion and hatred of traditional banks and government-issued money soared, with radicals scrutinizing alternate systems.

The other event dramatically to impact the radical fever from monetary reform was the Civil War for which the North financed its fighting through Legal Tender Acts and the National Banking Act of 1863.

The radicals did not merely theorize; they experimented with private currencies and new economic models. Their efforts are fascinating, but they are also cautionary tales. A major problem for 19th-century individualist-anarchism was the movement’s general acceptance of a link between sound money and the labor theory of value. This theory states that the true value of a good or service is based on the labor required to produce it rather than the price at which a seller and buyer are willing to exchange. In short, a good has intrinsic and not subjective value. (More on this in the section on the Regression Theorem.) Happily, their main economic goal was the abolition of the “money monopoly.” The term referred to three different but interacting forms of monopoly: banking, the charging of interest, and the privileged issuance of currency. The abolition of state power over currency was the focus, and they eschewed the use of force to implement their own schemes.

Josiah Warren provided a real-world example of what was meant by a currency that rested on the labor theory of value. Credited with being the first American anarchist, Warren tested his specific solution to the money monopoly through a Time Store from which he issued “Labor Notes.” In 1827, the business opened with $300 worth of groceries and dry goods that were offered at a 7 percent markup from Warren’s own costs in order to cover expenses such as overhead. This was before groceries were prepackaged or preweighed, and it was usual for buyers to bargain with the shopkeeper rather than pay a posted price. One of

Warren’s innovations was to post prices, which drove costs lower because transactions consumed less time. The customer paid in traditional money for the goods and paid with a Labor Note to compensate Warren for his time. The Labor Note obliged the customer to provide Warren with an equivalent amount of his time. If the buyer was a seamstress, for example, the Labor Note committed her to render to Warren X units of time to produce clothing. Warren’s goal was to establish an economy—or to establish a proof of principle, at least—in which profit was based on the exchange of time and labor. The Labor Notes were circulated and traded widely with in the community.

To some degree, Warren succeeded. People traveled from a hundred miles away to avail themselves of the Time Store’s low prices. After a few years, he declared the experiment to be a success and closed the store. Whether the Labor Notes were a success is questionable, however. The store itself may well have succeeded due to its low prices, not to the Notes. Whichever explanation is true, it is difficult to see how this novel currency could function in dense populations or on a grander scale of commerce. Few people today would be convinced of the viability of private money based on the Time Store experiment.

What could convince the public and economists that private currencies work as well or better than government-issued ones? Going back a bit further in American history is a good place to start because the future is always based on the past.

21Shares AG, a Zurich-based investment provider, is launching what is being dubbed as the world’s first Polkadot exchange-traded product, or ETP.

The DOT ETP will be listed on the Swiss exchange SIX on Thursday, February 4, said the company in a statement on Tuesday. DOT is the native token of the Polkadot network.

DOT has since been added to 21Shares’ Crypto Basket ETP (HODL), which tracks five major assets including bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH). Since its addition on Jan. 29, DOT now accounts for 27% of the product behind BTC at 50%.

Hany Rashwan, chief executive officer of 21Shares, said the firm has seen “unprecedented demand” from institutional investors wanting exposure to crypto-assets. He stated that demand for its range of crypto ETPs has soared 500% since the third quarter of 2020, but there has been “a recent surge in interest” for DOT.

“After investors purchase their first bitcoins through our ETPs, there is a natural transition to invest in other crypto assets,” Rashwan detailed.

“We benefit from trusted partners for the liquidity provision and upon continued institutional demand, we are launching the DOT ETP to give investors a safe, regulated, and easy way to obtain exposure to this exciting new blockchain technology,” he added.

Rashwan revealed that 21Shares, an issuer of exchange-traded products, is planning to add up to three ETPs over the next 3 months. He said European investors have been approaching the company to launch new products.

Created by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Polkadot is a cross-blockchain that enables transfers of any type of data or asset, not just tokens. It is also used as an electronic payment system.

DOT is now the world’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market capitalization of $16.55 billion, according to data from markets.Bitcoin.com. At the time of writing, DOT is trading at $17.22, up 8% over the past 24 hours.

Ukraine’s government-owned nuclear power plant picked a firm to build a massive data center in Rivne for cryptocurrency mining operations. After a bidding process, Energoatom chose Kyiv Energy Construction Company to handle the nuclear plant crypto mining project.

Nuclear Power Plant Operator Expects to Launch the Data Center in 2022

According to official documents, the data center will be based in the Rivne nuclear power plant, after the construction firm got 8.92 million Hryvnia ($317,620) in funding. The only competitor in the bidding was Ukrenergobudproek. However, they allegedly made an expensive offer, said the regional news outlet Forklog.

The Kyiv Energy Construction Company expects to finish the data center building by August 31, 2022. Per the announcement, the contractor is required to send the documentation that details the whole process. It includes “host state registers, electronic archives, and computing facilities.”

In terms of technical details, the nuclear power plant has a capacity of 2,657 megawatts, and it was built in the late 1970s. Also, the operations of the state-owned nuclear facilities started at the beginning of 1980.

In October 2020, Energoatom also signed a memorandum with a subsidiary of crypto mining giant Bitfury. With the new data center, local media outlets believe Bitfury miners could move their operations into the power plant’s facilities.

Ukraine’s Interest Towards Building Crypto Mining Data Centers in Nuclear Plants

The deal between Energoatom and Kyiv Energy Construction Company is not a surprising move. In fact, the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine asked Energoatom in May 2020 to conduct research to assess crypto mining’s feasibility at their nuclear plants.

As an anecdotal fact in terms of crypto mining in Ukrainian nuclear plants, the nation’s Security Service found illegal crypto mining equipment in a nuclear power plant in 2019.

The installation’s illegal mining rigs were found in the Southern region of Ukraine. Moreover, the investigations determined that such illegal equipment breached a “state secret.”

Global music distribution service Ditto has unveiled the latest addition to its service lineup for musicians with a blockchain-based financing platform named Opulous.

Opulous Peer-to-Peer Lending Platform Serves as a Loan Pool Designed to Help Artists

Ditto continues its efforts to improve the value chain for artists. Unlike other decentralized finance (defi) protocols, Opulous reflects asset-based lending, which bridges the physical and digital worlds. The Opulous’ defi lending mechanism, which is being developed on the Algorand public blockchain, leverages music copyrights’ tangibility through a smart contract setup that automatically handles principal and interest payments along with distributions to investors.

For musicians already receiving royalties, this presents a unique opportunity to monetize their assets or contribute to the pool to stake other artists. When seeking capital, artists can access funds by collateralizing loans from Opulous’ Music Copyright Pools with their music royalties.

Besides digitizing music as an asset class, the move will invite more democratized participation from artists and investors seeking to gain a foothold in the music industry, which is undergoing tremendous annual growth and expected to double in size by 2030. Artists benefit from interest rates starting as low as 4%, while investors in the copyright pools can add exposure to music royalties as an asset class for 10% returns per annum.

Per Ditto CEO Lee Parsons,

Opulous cuts out traditional banking, providing musicians with a platform with minimal interest payments, while giving investors the chance to stake a claim in one of the most exciting and fastest-growing financial industries in the world.

Ditto, which has already processed more than $1 billion in royalties for its 250,000-plus users, sees industry revenues doubling in the next ten years, building a compelling investment thesis. In keeping with Opulous’ mission to democratize musicians’ financial access, users outside the Ditto ecosystem are welcome to join the peer-to-peer lending framework.

Opulous has raised $1.5 million in funding to-date from BASIC, Borderless Capital, Kosmos Capital, Somesing, and TrustVerse. Roll out of the platform’s minimum viable product (MVP) is anticipated in two months as development proceeds.

Elastos, which built its decentralized application (dapp) platform and currency (ELA) to protect users’ digital assets and creations, will be among the first token staking partners for Opulous’ proof-of-stake consensus protocol. Opulous, in concert with Elastos, will allow investors to stake their Elastos (ELA) coins within the Music Copyright Pools.

According to Clarence Liu, the VP of Development at the Elastos Foundation,

Elastos and Ditto Music have been researching how blockchain can address fundamental inefficiencies in the music industry. Access to funding – which Opulous will address – is only the tip of the iceberg.

“Our collaboration has much more in the pipeline and our community is definitely set on using the forward momentum sparked by recent world events to introduce new users to the decentralized internet ideals set by Elastos,” Liu concludes.

During the last year, Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem has grown exponentially to form a multi Billion Dollar market. As Decentralized Finance expands, it becomes more and more relevant to have cross-chain connections that enable crypto assets to flow instantly and seamlessly across blockchain networks. These make it possible for DeFi platforms to be an effective alternative to centralized exchanges. Today, pNetwork launches the first EOS to Ethereum cross-chain connection to enable the EOS crypto asset to be moved into Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem.

EOS on Ethereum

EOS, the native token on the EOS blockchain, is a top20 cryptocurrency by market cap and the engine powering one of the most active dApps ecosystems. The asset counts over $ 3.5 Billion in daily trading volumes, figuring as the 9th most traded cryptocurrency. At present, only a fraction of the total is happening in a decentralized fashion.

While the DeFi ecosystem on EOS continues to grow, it has not yet reached Ethereum’s size. The latter powers Billions in daily trading volumes, Uniswap being the largestlarges liquidity protocol in existence and the fourth biggest DeFi protocol in terms of Total Value Locked.

Following the delivery of 26 bridges connecting six different blockchain protocols, including the cross-chain transfer of popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin, pNetwork launches today a new cross-chain connection that brings EOS to Ethereum.

As the first tokenised version of EOS, pEOS makes the asset compatible with Ethereum’s DeFi. This creates a benefit on both sides, enabling Ethereum’s DeFi protocols to expand their range of assets supported and granting EOS the option to be traded in a decentralized fashion as well as being supported as a collateral type by major Ethereum-based landing platforms.

Cross-chain connections are critical for a variety of use-cases, from NFTs to market making to decentralized indexes such as PieDAO’s Pies. pNetwork-powered asset tokenisation on Ethereum enables such indexes to represent the entire crypto market.

All pTokenised assets are pegged 1:1 to their underlying asset and are available for automated minting or redeeming on the pTokens dApp. In addition, pTokens are supported on a variety of DeFi protocols, decentralized exchanges and wallets on a growing number of blockchains.

Making Ethereum and EOS dApps Interoperable

Ethereum and EOS are two of the most active ecosystems for dApps, counting thousands of users each. By connecting these two blockchain environments, pNetwork aims to support the growth and development of decentralized applications such as lending/borrowing, trading, derivatives, and more. Acting as a cross-chain highway for cryptocurrencies to frictionlessly move from one blockchain to another, pNetwork powers the first bi-directional connection between the Ethereum and EOS blockchains.

Users on either blockchain are now able to interact with both ecosystems without ever leaving their blockchain of choice. Projects from both Ethereum and EOS communities have developed building blocks to create the next-generation financial system – with the connection between these two, users will find an even more powerful DeFi ecosystem.

By leveraging pNetwork’s cross-chain solution, dApps on the two blockchain platforms now have the opportunity to interoperate. Each ecosystem leveraging its counterpart’s strengths ultimately creates a benefit on both sides and sets the basis for sustainable growth. The presence of an EOS/ETH decentralized trading pair both with Ethereum’s and EOS’s decentralized finance, for example, makes it possible for market makers to arbitrage between the two blockchains. This results in a more liquid decentralized market for both assets.

Spacex and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been trying to get to the bottom of what happened with the popular trading app Robinhood when it stopped people from buying shares of hot stocks, like Gamestop. The shares of these stocks became popular due to the Wallstreetbets movement.

Elon Musk Says People Want the Truth From Robinhood

During an interview on The Good Time Show via the Clubhouse app Sunday night, Elon Musk grilled the CEO of trading app Robinhood, Vlad Tenev, over the company’s decision to restrict hot stocks last week, including Gamestop. On Friday, Robinhood also restricted crypto trading, citing “extraordinary market conditions.”

“What happened last week? Why can’t people buy the Gamestop shares? The people demand an answer and they want to know the details and the truth,” Musk said.

Tenev began by explaining the structure of his company. “Robinhood is actually a couple of companies,” he described. Robinhood Financial processes trades, Robinhood Securities clears and settles the trades, and Robinhood Crypto which deals with crypto trades.

The Robinhood CEO detailed that last Wednesday, his platform experienced “unprecedented volume” as “a lot of these so-called meme stocks were going viral on social media and people were joining Robinhood” to buy these stocks. Consequently, the company “received a file” from the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) Thursday morning at about 3:30 AM PST. It requested Robinhood to “put up money to the NSCC based on some factors,” including the volatility of certain securities. Tenev clarified that “this is the equities business so it’s based on stock trading and not options trading or anything else,” elaborating:

They gave us a file with a deposit and the request was around $3 billion dollars which is about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is.

Musk interrupted Tenev, questioning: “Why is that so high? It sounds like this is an unprecedented increase in demand for capital. What formula did they use to calculate that?”

Tenev replied: “We don’t have the full details. It’s a little bit of an opaque formula but there’s a component called the VAR of it, which is the Value at Risk, and that’s based on kind of some fairly quantitative things … and then there’s a special component which is discretionary so that kind of acts as a multiplier.” Tenev also noted that up until that point, his company “has raised a little bit around two billion dollars in total venture capital,” so the request was “a big number.”

The Tesla CEO interrupted again, asking: “What everyone wants to know is did something maybe shady go down here? It seems weird that you’d get a sudden $10 billion demand in the morning … suddenly out of nowhere.” Tenev swiftly corrected Musk that the number was $3 billion. The Robinhood CEO then emphasized:

I wouldn’t impugn shadiness to it or anything like that, and actually the NSCC was reasonable subsequent to this. They worked with us to actually lower it. It was unprecedented activity.

Musk abruptly asked Tenev: “Is there anyone holding you hostage right now?” Tenev chuckled and replied: “No, no, I’m okay. Thanks for asking.” Both laughed.

The Robinhood CEO proceeded to explain what happened, calling the experience “nerve-wrecking.” He said after receiving the request for $3 billion, his chief operating officer called up someone higher up at the NSCC to discuss what to do. “There was another call and they lowered it to something like $1.4 billion from $3 billion,” Tenev reiterated that it was still a high number. His company then proposed a plan to the NSCC of “marking these volatile stocks that were kind of driving the activity position-closing only.”

Then, at about 5 to 5:30 AM PST, before the market opened, the NSCC came back and reduced the deposit requirement to $700 million, “which we then deposited and paid promptly,” Tenev emphasized. Acknowledging that the move was bad for customers, the Robinhood CEO said, “We had no choice, in this case. We had to conform to our regulatory capital requirements and so the team did what they could to make sure we were available for customers.”

The Spacex CEO further questioned: “Who controls this organization, this clearinghouse?” Tenev replied: “It’s a consortium. It’s not quite a government agency. I don’t really know the details of all of that.” Nonetheless, he emphasized that “To be fair … I think there was legitimate sort of turmoil in the markets … so there probably is some amount of extra risk in the system that warrants higher requirements so it’s not entirely unreasonable.” He noted that lots of other brokers were in the same situation and had to restrict the same activity.

“So it sounds like this organization calls you up and they basically have a gun to your head: either hand over this money or else,” the Spacex CEO summarized, elaborating:

Basically, what people are wondering is did you sell your clients down the river or did you have no choice. If you had no choice, that’s understandable but then we got to find out why you had no choice and who are these people that are saying you have no choice.

“I think that’s fair. We have to comply with these requirements. Financial institutions have requirements,” Tenev responded. Nonetheless, he suggested that it would be helpful to know the formula the NSCC uses to calculate these requirements so companies can plan better.

Musk proceeded to ask about whether there was outside pressure forcing Robinhood to take the action it did. Tenev affirmed that there is “a rumor that Citadel or other market makers kind of pressured us into doing this.” However, he clarified, “that’s just false,” emphasizing that “this was a clearinghouse decision and it was just based on the capital requirements so from our perspective Citadel and other market makers weren’t involved in that.”

During the same Clubhouse interview, Elon also revealed that he is a supporter of bitcoin and should have bought the cryptocurrency eight years ago. He believes that bitcoin is on the verge of getting broad acceptance by traditional finance people. On Monday, Robinhood raised another $2.4 billion from shareholders after it secured $1 billion last Thursday.

PRESS RELEASE. The AdGram service was founded a year ago and is currently the largest advertising exchange in Telegram.

AdGram helps brands place large advertising volumes in channels and groups quickly and efficiently. Channels and groups benefit from expansion of their audience, it is easy to find advertisers and increase the earnings from advertising placements via AdGram.

Over the last 12 months, the service has gained a huge experience in communications with both advertisers and administrators from different countries, which has highlighted issues with settlements in multiple currencies. After overcoming these obstacles, it was decided that cryptocurrency could be the key to solving this problem.

With the termination of the Telegram team’s work on the TON project in May 2020 (the messenger lost one of its monetization methods), Free TON was launched which took over the development and popularization of TON Crystal using the open source code from the original TON. The uniqueness of FreeTON is that it is one of the few projects where all the tokens belong to the community and it is developing as a decentralized autonomous organization.

The potential of the underlying technology and the growth of the community inspired AdGram and in October 2020 they partnered with the FreeTON Community and fully integrated Crystal as a means of payment. Synergy with FreeTON made it possible to take a big step towards using cryptocurrencies as a single, simple and clear means of payment.

The ability to pay with tokens for advertising in Telegram creates a powerful use case for the TON Crystal token. Huge and constantly growing volume of the advertising market is vital for tokenomics as it creates supply and demand for market participants, thereby increasing the liquidity of the token itself.

For administrators and advertisers transactions in TON Crystal is simple, convenient and fast! It also solves the problem of collecting details for transfers in various currencies, and avoids paying banking fees.

Advertising on Telegram and the FreeTON blockchain, which is the successor of Durov’s original (but never happened Durov’s TON), create a strong and impact-resistant synergy of mutual benefits. This shows markets and communities can develop in a self-regulated environment.

PRESS RELEASE. CEX.IO LOAN experiences massive institutional demand for its crypto-backed lending service, with 41% of customers requesting to borrow cash against Bitcoin, 53% against Ethereum, and 6% against DeFi tokens.

Crypto-backed lending service CEX.IO LOAN that launched in October 2020 in select global jurisdictions, has been experiencing major demand, receiving over $100 million worth of loan requests to date. While the service has been widely popular among retail investors, most of the platform’s loan requests came from institutional investors.

According to CEX.IO LOAN, such an increase in demand can be attributed to the institutionalization of the cryptocurrency industry. Institutional investors, who have cryptocurrencies in their possession, regard it as a potential collateral for borrowing funds and actively utilise it as such. The borrowed funds are then used for further investment purposes.

In addition to featuring cutting-edge security and advanced anti-fraud measures, CEX.IO Group operates a regulated service, which has been licensed as a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) provider by the Gibraltar Financial Service Commission (GFSC) since last year. In addition to this, the Government of Gibraltar recently granted CEX.IO Limited a Money Lender License, allowing the firm to extend its ecosystem of regulated services with CEX.IO LOAN.

Institutional clients also prefer the company’s digital asset-backed lending service due to the convenience offered to users. On the CEX.IO LOAN platform, customers can borrow cash against their cryptocurrency assets in a quick and simple manner, without having to deal with credit checks or any unnecessary paperwork. To access the company’s instant crypto-backed lending service, new users have to open an account at the digital asset exchange and pass the mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML checks.

CEX.IO LOAN serves various cryptocurrency market participants, from retail investors, traders, and HODLers to startups, entrepreneurs, and large enterprises. As part of a flexible crypto-backed lending service, users can borrow any amount between $500 and $100,000 at competitive interest rates starting at 8.75% per year. Loan duration ranging from seven days to one year.

Currently, retail users can borrow funds against their Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) assets. Based on the company’s data, the feature has already experienced high demand from VIP clients, with 41% of all CEX.IO LOAN customers borrowing cash against Bitcoin (BTC), 53% against Ethereum (ETH), and 6% against DeFi tokens.

The company has recently introduced a VIP-exclusive feature to offer flexible lending conditions and the ability to use decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens as collateral for institutional clients on the crypto-backed lending platform.

Furthermore, to best serve institutional customers, the requests and queries of VIP clients are handled individually by dedicated personal managers on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Interestingly, 14% of CEX.IO VIP customers have already asked their personal managers about borrowing funds via the crypto-backed lending service.

“As institutional investors find the digital asset industry increasingly attractive, it’s a pleasure to serve them with our enterprise-grade instant crypto-backed loan platform. Security, convenience, and compliance are key priorities for corporate clients, which are features that we have been providing to all our clients in the rapidly growing CEX.IO ecosystem. Most importantly, we want to provide institutional clients with the best service. For that reason, VIP clients enjoy exclusive benefits, such as dedicated personal managers and flexible lending options, on the CEX.IO LOAN platform,” Anton Chashchin, Commercial Director for the CEX.IO LOAN service, stated.

In the announcement, the firm revealed further details about the size of the funds clients borrow on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Based on the company’s data, while retail investors borrow $1,400 on average, VIP clients request larger-sized loans that vary in size, with the typical amount being $1 million or higher.

Institutional clients do not just borrow more but also need the funds for more extended periods which usually range between 6 and 12 months. According to the company, this phenomenon indicates a long-term strategy for VIP clients to manage their assets.

PRESS RELEASE. PARSIQ, a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform connecting on-chain and off-chain applications in real-time, announced that its PRQ token is now listed on OKEx with USDT base pair.

Please take note of the following go-live schedule:

PRQ Deposit : 07:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Spot Trading : PRQ / USDT : 10:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Withdrawal : 10:00 January 29, 2021 (UTC)

PARSIQ is a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform that serves as a multi-level bridge between blockchains and off-chain applications. PARSIQ’s features automate the blockchain analytics and monitoring process, providing customizable workflows with real-time intelligence.

Developers and individual users can transform the blockchain data to their favorite off-chain application or web service.

Among the obvious use cases is monitoring the wallets of traders and ordinary users. Among the non-obvious are complex system integrations for financial institutions and DeFi projects that use the PARSIQ infrastructure to improve security, conduct audits, comply with regulatory requirements, AML, and expand their workflows in other ways.

The infrastructure underneath PARSIQ’s user interface is built with their proprietary programming language ParsiQL, and its users’ benefits are multiplying with each supported integration.

PRQ Token

PARSIQ Token (PRQ) is an essential piece of the PARSIQ platform that co-exists with FIAT payments for using its services. Payments within the platform that are made in PRQ tokens guarantee a discounted rate. During the first Epoch when PRQ tokens are used as payment for running Smart-Triggers users receive higher execution limits, unlock transport methods, and are able to propose features that can be added to the platform.

In October 2020, the PARSIQ team released plans for Epoch 2.0.

#1. Public Projects

With Public Projects users can subscribe to existing PARSIQ Projects that were pre-made by other users. By paying in PRQ, users that have subscribed to the Public Project will incentivize the creators to create interesting, complex, and more important – problem-solving projects.

#2. User Data and PRQ

Every single monitoring target (primitive of type address, a struct with the field of address type, table row) would require 1 PRQ to hold after the implementation. It means that if there are 1000 addresses (960 in the table as rows, 30 as primitives, 10 in the structs) then the User would need 1000 PRQ on the connected Ethereum Account balance.

#3. IQ Protocol

IQ Protocol will allow risk-free PRQ lending and collateral-less borrowing. Risk-free PRQ lending means that PRQ is not transferred from the lender’s address to the borrower’s address. Details on the algorithm are available in the dedicated explainer on PARSIQ’s blog.

#4. PRQBoost

PRQ Boost is a liquidity boost program to incentivize PRQ/ETH liquidity providers on Uniswap, which goes with the PRQBOOST utility tokens to increase rewards for liquidity providers.

PARSIQ is actively working to partner with major layer 1 blockchain protocols to expand the range of blockchain integrations and give projects that build on those protocols the ability to monitor and automate workflows between blockchain and off-chain.

PRESS RELEASE. YFX, the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts has just launched, adding an important piece to the DeFi money legos, and creating a direct competition against CEX on derivatives trading.

The most traded Bitcoin product in centralized exchanges is Bitcoin futures, which is 10 times bigger than spot trading in terms of the trading volume. But in DEX, spot trading platforms like Uniswap are occupying a large portion of the total trading volume, and there is not a single decentralized futures trading platform that could reach even 1/10 of Uniswap’s trading volume. What stops decentralized futures trading platforms from becoming 10 times bigger than Uniswap? Why are decentralized futures trading platforms performing worse than their centralized counterparts?

The main reason is that decentralized futures exchanges don’t currently provide an attractive futures product to compete with centralized futures exchanges. For instance, centralized futures exchanges like BitMex can provide 100x leverage on Bitcoin futures trading. On the other hand, decentralized futures exchanges like dYdX only offer 10x leverage. None of the decentralized exchanges can keep up with the 100x leverage offering from centralized exchanges.

YFX Descartes V1 uses QIC-AMM and a system de-risk mechanism to migrate perpetual futures trading from CEX to DEX without reducing the trading leverage, which makes YFX the first DEX that could offer 100x leverage on a perpetual contract. You can do everything on YFX that you can do on BitMex or OKEx. YFX is poised to compete directly against established centralized exchanges. YFX Descartes V1 runs on the TRON MainNet, for faster transaction times and cheaper gas fees compared to Ethereum. The YFX team is also working on Ethereum’s Layer 2 solution to provide pragmatic perpetual trading on DEX. YFX team plans to launch their DEX on Huobi Heco and Ethereum Test net in Q1, 2021.

About YFX

YFX is the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts. YFX Descartes V1 launched on the TRON MainNet, and all trades are held and processed by smart contracts. The main goal of the YFX team, which is formed by a group of engineers who have years of experience working on trading systems and blockchain, is to build a DEX that can compete with CEX on derivative trading.

The Wall Street Bets saga, an incredibly ridiculous story about a group of amateur Reddit investors who beat career Wall Street hedge funds at their own game, is to be made into a movie.

According to a report by online news site Deadline on Jan. 31, Metro Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) won the rights to produce the film in a bidding war involving major Hollywood movie houses.

The movie is to be based on a book proposed by author Ben Mezrich. Mezrich’s previous work, “The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding Of Facebook, a Tale Of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal,” was adapted into the motion picture “The Social Network.”

The title to his planned latest book offering is called “The Antisocial Network,” said the report, quoting sources familiar with the development. The book is expected to go out to publishers later this February, it said.

However, it is not yet clear what shape or structure the movie will take. MGM’s Michael DeLuca will produce the film. DeLuca also produced the Academy-Award winning The Social Network. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss will executive produce via their Winklevoss Pictures production company.

The Wall Street Bets group noticed that major hedge funds on Wall Street had been placing short bets against companies they considered to be dying. The funds particularly targeted Gamestop, the world’s largest video game retailer, continually shorting the company’s shares.

But the Redditors saw an opportunity to make profit and collectively bet the other way, buying shares and stock options. This resulted in the value of the Gamestop shares soaring by more than 2,600% in January.

Hedge funds that had shorted the stock incurred losses running into several billions of dollars. One fund, Melvin Capital, reportedly lost up to $7 billion to the “short squeeze” in January, forcing it to restructure its investment portfolio to ensure a faster escape in future “squeezes.”

The Reddit traders also extended the pump to a few other stocks considered to be dying, including AMC (which climbed over 900% in January), as well as Nokia and Blackberry. This surge of activity resulted in a major controversy when the trading app Robinhood began restricting trade on certain stocks.

Alongside the cryptocurrency’s meteoric climb over the back half of 2020 and early 2021, a curious phenomenon has unfolded; heightened profit-taking and conversion to fiat currencies. Data collected by Simplex, a fiat-crypto gateway, underscores this seemingly paradoxical development.

A Curious Race to Convert Crypto to Fiat Has Accompanied Bitcoin’s Latest Drive Higher

Sharing exclusive data with Bitcoin.com, Simplex cofounder and chief analytics officer Netanel Kabala says:

While the international press coverage of Bitcoin’s rally has caused a swathe of new users to flock to the industry and buy-in, outflows have been equally significant. Of the total amount of cryptocurrency sold in the last six months, 43% was off ramped in December alone.

A quick look at Google Trends for the term ‘Bitcoin’ echoes these developments, especially now that new equity instruments like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and big-name funds like Blackrock are adding exposure and raising crypto awareness.

Still, given the increased ability to quickly convert crypto and withdraw in fiat currencies, the uptick in funds leaving the ecosystem is astonishing. Part of this can be attributed to the growing fungibility of cryptocurrency, primarily helped by the support of players like Simplex, which empowers users to buy, sell, and spend crypto through Visa partnerships.

Although some of the latest rally’s onlookers have decried the rapid rise in crypto valuations as proof that a bubble is forming in this nascent asset class, others within the industry see the development as a harbinger of times to come. One of the areas this is most apparent is altcoins.

Data compiled by Simplex illustrates that as Bitcoin prices have leveled off above $30,000, daily purchases of altcoins have risen by approximately 65%. More interestingly, the data highlights that newer users account for nearly 20% of this volume, marking a sharp increase in the number of novice retail investors expanding and diversifying their exposure within the ecosystem.

Poloniex, one of the top 20 global cryptocurrency exchanges, which has adopted Simplex’s platform, has experienced these results firsthand. Karen McHenry, Poloniex’s Director of Product, attributes this development to greater access within the ecosystem, especially with Simplex’s buy option, which promotes instant account funding alongside the heightened ability to cash out quickly.

She also doesn’t see the ability to more quickly convert from crypto to fiat as harming interest despite the eyepopping amounts taken off exchanges.

It may sound surprising, but adding the ‘sell’ option actually has a positive impact on the number of crypto transactions too.

Though this easy offramp and soaring volume of sell orders might seem negative for prices, it can also be viewed as a healthy reflection of the ecosystem’s growing use cases. Besides making it easier to exit and enter, growing areas like decentralized finance (defi) and greater fungibility all contribute to a cryptocurrency’s value proposition.

As institutions begin lining up to add exposure as retail accumulation climbs, Bitcoin momentum may actually accelerate, and by extension, lift the altcoins sought after by the newcomers seeking opportunities outside the seminal crypto coin.

McHenry adds:

If the bull market can maintain its momentum, some of these BTC profits will flow into altcoins, which are particularly popular among retail investors. This creates a positive feedback loop, with traders who turn a profit prone to telling their friends about crypto, which brings more investment into the space.

This past week, another social media trend started on the Reddit forum r/wallstreetbets, which aims to initiate a large silver short squeeze in order to push the price of the precious metal to $1,000 per ounce. However, the silver squeeze trend comes with controversy, as numerous wallstreetbets supporters believe hedge funds like Melvin Capital and Citadel are behind the silver push.

The Controversial ‘Silver Squeeze’

During the last week, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the wallstreetbets (WSB) saga taking place on social media forums and the infamous subreddit r/wallstreetbets. Since the mega short squeeze on the Gamestop (GME) shares, the squeeze maneuver has also spilled into a number of other stocks. This week, shares from the Russell 3000 Index (RUA) were targeted including tickers like NOK, GOGO, AMCX, and FIZZ. But the trend didn’t stop there, as one post, in particular, had called for a “silver squeeze.” The WSB Reddit post called for the silver squeeze to push the price of silver from $25 per ounce to $1,000.

Now since the post was published, the Reddit admins in charge of moderating r/wallstreetbets removed the post. But that was long after the message was made viral by the participants discussing the pros and cons of attempting to squeeze silver. Now the reason people think the silver short squeeze post may be shady, is because a number of WSB Redditors believe the silver squeeze was invoked by the hedge funds losing money in order to cover their GME losses. There are a great number of Reddit posts warning that people should not participate in the silver short squeeze.

One post said:

Citadel is the 5th largest owner of [silver], it’s imperative we do not ‘squeeze’ it. These are hedge fund bots spamming awards.

The people who dislike the silver trend on WSB, have also warned that Melvin Capital Management is also a big silver holder. Unfortunately, it is hard to tell where the silver pump threads and posts are stemming from, as there are many free-market supporters who are fans of the precious metal sometimes referred to as the ‘poor man’s gold.’

Despite this, there are numbers of WSB fans and Redditors claiming the silver pump stemmed from hedge fund people and they believe there are imposters everywhere now. Some of these people are growing irrational, getting mad at anyone who posts about silver. Many WSB supporters might be feeling the pain from Gamestop Corp. shares dropping significantly on Monday.

Silver soars past $30 a troy ounce as Reddit-fuelled buying frenzy continues for 3rd day. #Silversqueeze pic.twitter.com/mLmasUBrq1 — Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) February 1, 2021

In Spite of Controversy, Something Is Sparking Silver Demand

Despite the speculation, some sort of demand was invoked when it comes to silver prices and obtaining physical bullion. For instance, if you are attempting to purchase an ounce or ounces of silver bullion online, the process is far more complicated now than it was last week. A large portion of bars and coins are either sold out or the prices are marked up considerably.

This is simple arbitrage. #Silver futures are 28.67. Silver Eagles on Apmex are $41.66, thats a 45% premium to futures. Obvious opportunity to buy futures & stand for delivery for a 35% discount on physical right? But when they don't have it, Futures = $41.66/oz. #silversqueeze — Jonathan #SILVERSQUEEZE Mergott (@Jmergz1985) February 1, 2021

All the American Eagles are sold out across a number of bullion dealers. On Sunday morning, a few big-name dealers have halted a great number of silver sales. News.Bitcoin.com’s most recent WSB report disclosed how SD Bullion sold nearly 10x the number of silver ounces than usual. People visiting bullion dealer websites like Provident, Apmex, and JD Bullion could see the unprecedented demand targeting physical silver.

“In the last week, we have seen a dramatic shift in Silver demand from our customers,” said Ken Lewis CEO of the bullion dealer Apmex. “For example, the ratio of ounces sold per day was running about two times earlier in the week and closer to four times the average demand by the end of the week,” Lewis added.

The Apmex CEO further stressed:

Once markets closed on Friday, we saw demand hit as much as six times a typical business day and more than 12 times a normal weekend day. Combined with the extremely high demand levels, we are also seeing a surge in new customers. On Saturday alone, we added as many new customers as we usually add in a week.

Additionally, the hashtag “#silversqueeze” has been trending throughout the United States and a few other countries on Twitter during the last 48 hours. By the late afternoon on Sunday, spot silver and futures traded at $27 per Troy ounce, and by Monday morning spot silver traded 7.7% higher at $29.76. The commodity hopped above the $30 region, and silver prices per ounce exchanged hands at $30.35 an ounce. One ounce of .999 silver is hovering in the $29 price handle at the time of publication

CHAPTER ONE: Listening to the Past

“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.” — Satoshi Nakamoto

The trusted third party problem has haunted modern financial systems and centralized exchanges because people require an intermediary to make them work. The third party’s good or bad motives become a defining aspect of the transaction, and the those who use the institutions are at the mercy of those intentions. This is especially true of the current system of state-issued money and central banking.

A trustless system avoids intermediaries and does not depend upon the intentions of participants; that is, the system functions in the same manner regardless of anyone’s intentions. The blockchain, with a transparent and immutable peer-to peer protocol, is called trustless because there is no corruptible intermediary upon whom exchanges must depend.

On a small scale, the trusted third party problem may always exist because a middleman is useful or necessary in some situations. If third parties offer competitive services on a free market, however, the damage of dishonesty or incompetence is limited. People can take their business elsewhere, report a swindler to watchdogs, warn others, and file a lawsuit.

An occasionally dishonest third party is not the problem Satoshi addresses. He speaks to the institutionalized corruption of government and central banks from which the average person could not escape by using a competitor or by suing. Almost everyone who works over the table, runs a business, buys or sells goods, accepts government benefits or pays taxes has had to accept a fiat that constantly plunges in value due to inflation. Almost everyone who uses credit, accepts checks, takes out loans, conducts commerce or does business abroad has needed to go through banks that steal like drunken muggers.

For average people, the situation used to seem hopeless because no legal, practical, and private alternative existed for transferring funds across considerable distance, including borders. Attempts to reform or remove the system also seemed doomed because it was inherently corrupt and self-serving. In fact, fiat and central banking were serving the purpose for which they had been established: financial control by elites. People’s need for money and exchange became their straitjackets.

Then Satoshi. Then the blockchain and crypto. A new concept of money was created in a form that cannot not be inflated; the number of bitcoins is fixed at 21 million divisible units. The supply can only decrease when coins are lost, as inevitably happens. Satoshi notes, “Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.” Bitcoin solved the fiat problem.

A new concept of financial transfer solved the third party problem, especially with regard to banks. Although peer-to-peer transactions involve a middleman or miner, no trust is required since the transaction is released only when “proof of work” is rendered, which consists of solving a complicated math problem. Arriving at a solution may be costly in computer power and time, but the solutions themselves are easy to verify. Satoshi comments, “With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.” The soundness and propriety of the blockchain’s protocol itself is assured by the use of open source that is visible to all and verifiable. The political outcome: A private currency and method of exchange freed people from financial oppression.

The idea of private currency itself is hardly new, however.

Precedent in Radical Individualist Theory

The late Friedrich Hayek is the most respected Austrian economist of the 20th century. His book The Denationalisation of Money: An Analysis of the Theory and Practice of Concurrent Currencies argues vigorously for private and competitive currencies to displace government-issued ones. Hayek ponders a key question. “When one studies the history of money one cannot help wondering why people should have put up for so long with governments exercising an exclusive power over two thousand years that was regularly used to exploit and defraud them. This can be explained only by the myth” that government money was necessary “becoming so firmly established that it did not occur even to the professional students of these matters…ever to question it. But once the validity of the established doctrine is doubted its foundation is rapidly seen to be fragile.”

Governments reap incredible profits from debasing the currency, but the rigged game works only if people have no alternative but to play it. The political purpose of legal tender and banking laws is to grant a monopoly to the state, which permits the redistribution of wealth and power from average people upward to the elite of society. Fiat money and banking remains fragile, however, because the system relies on people either not understanding the dynamics or not having a choice. Hayek wonders why public understanding is so elusive. Why was “a government monopoly of the provision of money…universally regarded as indispensable” and what would happen “if the provision of money were thrown open to the competition of private concerns supplying different currencies?”

With eerie prescience, Hayek argues for currencies developed by entrepreneurs who innovate new forms of money just as they innovate in other areas. One of the drawbacks of government’s monopoly is that it imposes a freeze on the sort of invention that now runs free in crypto. The voluntaryist historian Carl Watner observes, “No one can tell in advance what form these monies might take because no one can know for sure what choices individuals would make or what new technologies might be discovered. Laws forcing people to use the Federal Reserve System money have frozen monetary developments at a certain stage…Just imagine if Congress had protected the Post Office by passing laws that would have prevented people from communicating via the internet. We would never have experienced the marvels of e-mail.”

The late Austrian economist Murray Rothbard also wrestles with the question of “why do people so vigorously resist private currencies?” His book For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto advances an explanation. “If the government and only the government had had a monopoly of the shoe manufacturing and retailing business, how would most of the public treat the libertarian who now came along to advocate that the government get out of the shoe business and throw it open to private enterprise?” Rothbard predicts that the skeptics would attack the libertarian for depriving them of the only possible source of shoes—the government. People are thoroughly indoctrinated to believe that daily life cannot function without the state and fiat.

Hayek and Rothbard are unusual among free-market economists in their embrace of private money and monetary systems. Even laissez-faire zealots rarely champion free-market currencies or private banking. Instead, they debate marginal issues such as fractional reserve and other reforms they think will improve the existing system. Or they argue for the restoration of a gold standard as though it were a panacea. But if a gold standard were applied to fiat, the system would still require people to trust the government and banks. This means trusting both institutions to act against their own interests, which they have historically neglected to do.

The modern neglect of free-market money and banking is odd because 19th century radical individualists focused intensely on the importance of private money and private banking to personal freedom. They placed a primal emphasis on the right of every individual to create his own currency and to function as his own bank. It was a natural right as important as freedom of speech or of religion. The pivotal individualist Benjamin Tucker believed that the right to issue private currency was so important that it could destroy the State all by itself. His reasoning: The money monopoly, including control of credit, was how the State sustained itself and robbed average people not merely of wealth but also of economic opportunity.

Two specific events sculpted the approach that the early individualist-anarchists adopted toward the monetary monopoly. One was the Panic of 1837 that tipped the United States into recession until the mid-1840s. Commonly cited causes of the Panic include a collapsing land bubble and a sharp fall in cotton prices. Blame is also placed at the feet of President Andrew Jackson for vetoing the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States and precipitating an unfortunate chain of economic events. Drawing on the work of Professor of Economics Peter Temin, Rothbard disputes this interpretation.

First, he [Temin] points out that the price inflation really began earlier, when wholesale prices reached a trough of 82 in July 1830 and then rose by 20.7 percent in three years to reach 99 in the fall of 1833. The reason for the price rise is simple: The total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $159 million in 1833, an increase of 45.9 percent, or an annual rise of 15.3 percent. Breaking the figures down further, the total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $155 million a year and a half later, a spectacular expansion of 35 percent. Unquestionably, this monetary expansion was spurred by the still-flourishing Bank of the United States, which increased its notes and deposits from January 1830 to January 1832 from a total of $29 million to $42.1 million, a rise of 45.2 percent. Thus, the price and money inflation in the first few years of the 1830s were again sparked by the expansion of the still-dominant central bank.

Arguably, the Panic began in May 1837 when banks in New York City announced they would not redeem commercial paper for specie at full face value. Of the approximately 800 banks in America, all but six ceased at one point or another to redeem banknotes and deposits for gold or silver coins. Suspicion and hatred of traditional banks and government-issued money soared, with radicals scrutinizing alternate systems.

The other event dramatically to impact the radical fever from monetary reform was the Civil War for which the North financed its fighting through Legal Tender Acts and the National Banking Act of 1863.

The radicals did not merely theorize; they experimented with private currencies and new economic models. Their efforts are fascinating, but they are also cautionary tales. A major problem for 19th-century individualist-anarchism was the movement’s general acceptance of a link between sound money and the labor theory of value. This theory states that the true value of a good or service is based on the labor required to produce it rather than the price at which a seller and buyer are willing to exchange. In short, a good has intrinsic and not subjective value. (More on this in the section on the Regression Theorem.) Happily, their main economic goal was the abolition of the “money monopoly.” The term referred to three different but interacting forms of monopoly: banking, the charging of interest, and the privileged issuance of currency. The abolition of state power over currency was the focus, and they eschewed the use of force to implement their own schemes.

Josiah Warren provided a real-world example of what was meant by a currency that rested on the labor theory of value. Credited with being the first American anarchist, Warren tested his specific solution to the money monopoly through a Time Store from which he issued “Labor Notes.” In 1827, the business opened with $300 worth of groceries and dry goods that were offered at a 7 percent markup from Warren’s own costs in order to cover expenses such as overhead. This was before groceries were prepackaged or preweighed, and it was usual for buyers to bargain with the shopkeeper rather than pay a posted price. One of

Warren’s innovations was to post prices, which drove costs lower because transactions consumed less time. The customer paid in traditional money for the goods and paid with a Labor Note to compensate Warren for his time. The Labor Note obliged the customer to provide Warren with an equivalent amount of his time. If the buyer was a seamstress, for example, the Labor Note committed her to render to Warren X units of time to produce clothing. Warren’s goal was to establish an economy—or to establish a proof of principle, at least—in which profit was based on the exchange of time and labor. The Labor Notes were circulated and traded widely with in the community.

To some degree, Warren succeeded. People traveled from a hundred miles away to avail themselves of the Time Store’s low prices. After a few years, he declared the experiment to be a success and closed the store. Whether the Labor Notes were a success is questionable, however. The store itself may well have succeeded due to its low prices, not to the Notes. Whichever explanation is true, it is difficult to see how this novel currency could function in dense populations or on a grander scale of commerce. Few people today would be convinced of the viability of private money based on the Time Store experiment.

What could convince the public and economists that private currencies work as well or better than government-issued ones? Going back a bit further in American history is a good place to start because the future is always based on the past.

21Shares AG, a Zurich-based investment provider, is launching what is being dubbed as the world’s first Polkadot exchange-traded product, or ETP.

The DOT ETP will be listed on the Swiss exchange SIX on Thursday, February 4, said the company in a statement on Tuesday. DOT is the native token of the Polkadot network.

DOT has since been added to 21Shares’ Crypto Basket ETP (HODL), which tracks five major assets including bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH). Since its addition on Jan. 29, DOT now accounts for 27% of the product behind BTC at 50%.

Hany Rashwan, chief executive officer of 21Shares, said the firm has seen “unprecedented demand” from institutional investors wanting exposure to crypto-assets. He stated that demand for its range of crypto ETPs has soared 500% since the third quarter of 2020, but there has been “a recent surge in interest” for DOT.

“After investors purchase their first bitcoins through our ETPs, there is a natural transition to invest in other crypto assets,” Rashwan detailed.

“We benefit from trusted partners for the liquidity provision and upon continued institutional demand, we are launching the DOT ETP to give investors a safe, regulated, and easy way to obtain exposure to this exciting new blockchain technology,” he added.

Rashwan revealed that 21Shares, an issuer of exchange-traded products, is planning to add up to three ETPs over the next 3 months. He said European investors have been approaching the company to launch new products.

Created by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Polkadot is a cross-blockchain that enables transfers of any type of data or asset, not just tokens. It is also used as an electronic payment system.

DOT is now the world’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market capitalization of $16.55 billion, according to data from markets.Bitcoin.com. At the time of writing, DOT is trading at $17.22, up 8% over the past 24 hours.

Ukraine’s government-owned nuclear power plant picked a firm to build a massive data center in Rivne for cryptocurrency mining operations. After a bidding process, Energoatom chose Kyiv Energy Construction Company to handle the nuclear plant crypto mining project.

Nuclear Power Plant Operator Expects to Launch the Data Center in 2022

According to official documents, the data center will be based in the Rivne nuclear power plant, after the construction firm got 8.92 million Hryvnia ($317,620) in funding. The only competitor in the bidding was Ukrenergobudproek. However, they allegedly made an expensive offer, said the regional news outlet Forklog.

The Kyiv Energy Construction Company expects to finish the data center building by August 31, 2022. Per the announcement, the contractor is required to send the documentation that details the whole process. It includes “host state registers, electronic archives, and computing facilities.”

In terms of technical details, the nuclear power plant has a capacity of 2,657 megawatts, and it was built in the late 1970s. Also, the operations of the state-owned nuclear facilities started at the beginning of 1980.

In October 2020, Energoatom also signed a memorandum with a subsidiary of crypto mining giant Bitfury. With the new data center, local media outlets believe Bitfury miners could move their operations into the power plant’s facilities.

Ukraine’s Interest Towards Building Crypto Mining Data Centers in Nuclear Plants

The deal between Energoatom and Kyiv Energy Construction Company is not a surprising move. In fact, the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine asked Energoatom in May 2020 to conduct research to assess crypto mining’s feasibility at their nuclear plants.

As an anecdotal fact in terms of crypto mining in Ukrainian nuclear plants, the nation’s Security Service found illegal crypto mining equipment in a nuclear power plant in 2019.

The installation’s illegal mining rigs were found in the Southern region of Ukraine. Moreover, the investigations determined that such illegal equipment breached a “state secret.”

Global music distribution service Ditto has unveiled the latest addition to its service lineup for musicians with a blockchain-based financing platform named Opulous.

Opulous Peer-to-Peer Lending Platform Serves as a Loan Pool Designed to Help Artists

Ditto continues its efforts to improve the value chain for artists. Unlike other decentralized finance (defi) protocols, Opulous reflects asset-based lending, which bridges the physical and digital worlds. The Opulous’ defi lending mechanism, which is being developed on the Algorand public blockchain, leverages music copyrights’ tangibility through a smart contract setup that automatically handles principal and interest payments along with distributions to investors.

For musicians already receiving royalties, this presents a unique opportunity to monetize their assets or contribute to the pool to stake other artists. When seeking capital, artists can access funds by collateralizing loans from Opulous’ Music Copyright Pools with their music royalties.

Besides digitizing music as an asset class, the move will invite more democratized participation from artists and investors seeking to gain a foothold in the music industry, which is undergoing tremendous annual growth and expected to double in size by 2030. Artists benefit from interest rates starting as low as 4%, while investors in the copyright pools can add exposure to music royalties as an asset class for 10% returns per annum.

Per Ditto CEO Lee Parsons,

Opulous cuts out traditional banking, providing musicians with a platform with minimal interest payments, while giving investors the chance to stake a claim in one of the most exciting and fastest-growing financial industries in the world.

Ditto, which has already processed more than $1 billion in royalties for its 250,000-plus users, sees industry revenues doubling in the next ten years, building a compelling investment thesis. In keeping with Opulous’ mission to democratize musicians’ financial access, users outside the Ditto ecosystem are welcome to join the peer-to-peer lending framework.

Opulous has raised $1.5 million in funding to-date from BASIC, Borderless Capital, Kosmos Capital, Somesing, and TrustVerse. Roll out of the platform’s minimum viable product (MVP) is anticipated in two months as development proceeds.

Elastos, which built its decentralized application (dapp) platform and currency (ELA) to protect users’ digital assets and creations, will be among the first token staking partners for Opulous’ proof-of-stake consensus protocol. Opulous, in concert with Elastos, will allow investors to stake their Elastos (ELA) coins within the Music Copyright Pools.

According to Clarence Liu, the VP of Development at the Elastos Foundation,

Elastos and Ditto Music have been researching how blockchain can address fundamental inefficiencies in the music industry. Access to funding – which Opulous will address – is only the tip of the iceberg.

“Our collaboration has much more in the pipeline and our community is definitely set on using the forward momentum sparked by recent world events to introduce new users to the decentralized internet ideals set by Elastos,” Liu concludes.

During the last year, Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem has grown exponentially to form a multi Billion Dollar market. As Decentralized Finance expands, it becomes more and more relevant to have cross-chain connections that enable crypto assets to flow instantly and seamlessly across blockchain networks. These make it possible for DeFi platforms to be an effective alternative to centralized exchanges. Today, pNetwork launches the first EOS to Ethereum cross-chain connection to enable the EOS crypto asset to be moved into Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem.

EOS on Ethereum

EOS, the native token on the EOS blockchain, is a top20 cryptocurrency by market cap and the engine powering one of the most active dApps ecosystems. The asset counts over $ 3.5 Billion in daily trading volumes, figuring as the 9th most traded cryptocurrency. At present, only a fraction of the total is happening in a decentralized fashion.

While the DeFi ecosystem on EOS continues to grow, it has not yet reached Ethereum’s size. The latter powers Billions in daily trading volumes, Uniswap being the largestlarges liquidity protocol in existence and the fourth biggest DeFi protocol in terms of Total Value Locked.

Following the delivery of 26 bridges connecting six different blockchain protocols, including the cross-chain transfer of popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin, pNetwork launches today a new cross-chain connection that brings EOS to Ethereum.

As the first tokenised version of EOS, pEOS makes the asset compatible with Ethereum’s DeFi. This creates a benefit on both sides, enabling Ethereum’s DeFi protocols to expand their range of assets supported and granting EOS the option to be traded in a decentralized fashion as well as being supported as a collateral type by major Ethereum-based landing platforms.

Cross-chain connections are critical for a variety of use-cases, from NFTs to market making to decentralized indexes such as PieDAO’s Pies. pNetwork-powered asset tokenisation on Ethereum enables such indexes to represent the entire crypto market.

All pTokenised assets are pegged 1:1 to their underlying asset and are available for automated minting or redeeming on the pTokens dApp. In addition, pTokens are supported on a variety of DeFi protocols, decentralized exchanges and wallets on a growing number of blockchains.

Making Ethereum and EOS dApps Interoperable

Ethereum and EOS are two of the most active ecosystems for dApps, counting thousands of users each. By connecting these two blockchain environments, pNetwork aims to support the growth and development of decentralized applications such as lending/borrowing, trading, derivatives, and more. Acting as a cross-chain highway for cryptocurrencies to frictionlessly move from one blockchain to another, pNetwork powers the first bi-directional connection between the Ethereum and EOS blockchains.

Users on either blockchain are now able to interact with both ecosystems without ever leaving their blockchain of choice. Projects from both Ethereum and EOS communities have developed building blocks to create the next-generation financial system – with the connection between these two, users will find an even more powerful DeFi ecosystem.

By leveraging pNetwork’s cross-chain solution, dApps on the two blockchain platforms now have the opportunity to interoperate. Each ecosystem leveraging its counterpart’s strengths ultimately creates a benefit on both sides and sets the basis for sustainable growth. The presence of an EOS/ETH decentralized trading pair both with Ethereum’s and EOS’s decentralized finance, for example, makes it possible for market makers to arbitrage between the two blockchains. This results in a more liquid decentralized market for both assets.

As the so-called ‘meme coin’ is actively making the headlines within the crypto sphere, a publicly-traded company is joining the dogecoin frenzy. Kronos Advanced Technology announced they’ll start accepting dogecoin as one of its payment methods.

Kronos Also Accepts Other Cryptocurrencies Such as Bitcoin and Ether

According to the announcement, the Los Angeles-based firm is adding dogecoin (DOGE) to its accepted payment form. In fact, customers will be able to purchase air purifiers, and personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies via the meme coin.

Adopting dogecoin as a payment method was not as part as just of a crypto adoption-driven maneuver. The company praised the popularity of the token and its uniqueness within the industry.

Also, Kronos pointed out that dogecoins transactions’ speed is a positive note for the Shiba Inu inspired meme token. So far, the company accepts several cryptos as payment methods, such as bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), litecoin (LTC), among others.

Expanding N95 Mask Market Into the Dogecoin Community

Michael Rubinov, president of Kronos Advanced Technologies, commented on the company’s stance towards cryptocurrencies:

In the last ten years, much has been said about how cryptocurrency will revolutionize payments, services, businesses and will change the world the way we know it. Cryptocurrency has changed e-commerce: as more and more people now shop online. Cryptocurrency gives customers more reasons to utilize the convenience of online shopping, as it mitigates the risk of fraud for both vendors and shoppers.

By adopting dogecoin as a form of payment, Kronos also expect to market N95 masks to the entire meme coin community on Reddit, which has grown over 670,000 members. The company also praised the fact that Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk endorses dogecoin as one of his favorite cryptocurrencies.

Despite the recent frenzy seen in the meme coin, the latest markets.Bitcoin.com data shows that dogecoin is exchanging hands at $0.0317, down -20.43% on Tuesday. The market capitalization still stands at $4.08 billion.

Spacex and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been trying to get to the bottom of what happened with the popular trading app Robinhood when it stopped people from buying shares of hot stocks, like Gamestop. The shares of these stocks became popular due to the Wallstreetbets movement.

Elon Musk Says People Want the Truth From Robinhood

During an interview on The Good Time Show via the Clubhouse app Sunday night, Elon Musk grilled the CEO of trading app Robinhood, Vlad Tenev, over the company’s decision to restrict hot stocks last week, including Gamestop. On Friday, Robinhood also restricted crypto trading, citing “extraordinary market conditions.”

“What happened last week? Why can’t people buy the Gamestop shares? The people demand an answer and they want to know the details and the truth,” Musk said.

Tenev began by explaining the structure of his company. “Robinhood is actually a couple of companies,” he described. Robinhood Financial processes trades, Robinhood Securities clears and settles the trades, and Robinhood Crypto which deals with crypto trades.

The Robinhood CEO detailed that last Wednesday, his platform experienced “unprecedented volume” as “a lot of these so-called meme stocks were going viral on social media and people were joining Robinhood” to buy these stocks. Consequently, the company “received a file” from the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) Thursday morning at about 3:30 AM PST. It requested Robinhood to “put up money to the NSCC based on some factors,” including the volatility of certain securities. Tenev clarified that “this is the equities business so it’s based on stock trading and not options trading or anything else,” elaborating:

They gave us a file with a deposit and the request was around $3 billion dollars which is about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is.

Musk interrupted Tenev, questioning: “Why is that so high? It sounds like this is an unprecedented increase in demand for capital. What formula did they use to calculate that?”

Tenev replied: “We don’t have the full details. It’s a little bit of an opaque formula but there’s a component called the VAR of it, which is the Value at Risk, and that’s based on kind of some fairly quantitative things … and then there’s a special component which is discretionary so that kind of acts as a multiplier.” Tenev also noted that up until that point, his company “has raised a little bit around two billion dollars in total venture capital,” so the request was “a big number.”

The Tesla CEO interrupted again, asking: “What everyone wants to know is did something maybe shady go down here? It seems weird that you’d get a sudden $10 billion demand in the morning … suddenly out of nowhere.” Tenev swiftly corrected Musk that the number was $3 billion. The Robinhood CEO then emphasized:

I wouldn’t impugn shadiness to it or anything like that, and actually the NSCC was reasonable subsequent to this. They worked with us to actually lower it. It was unprecedented activity.

Musk abruptly asked Tenev: “Is there anyone holding you hostage right now?” Tenev chuckled and replied: “No, no, I’m okay. Thanks for asking.” Both laughed.

The Robinhood CEO proceeded to explain what happened, calling the experience “nerve-wrecking.” He said after receiving the request for $3 billion, his chief operating officer called up someone higher up at the NSCC to discuss what to do. “There was another call and they lowered it to something like $1.4 billion from $3 billion,” Tenev reiterated that it was still a high number. His company then proposed a plan to the NSCC of “marking these volatile stocks that were kind of driving the activity position-closing only.”

Then, at about 5 to 5:30 AM PST, before the market opened, the NSCC came back and reduced the deposit requirement to $700 million, “which we then deposited and paid promptly,” Tenev emphasized. Acknowledging that the move was bad for customers, the Robinhood CEO said, “We had no choice, in this case. We had to conform to our regulatory capital requirements and so the team did what they could to make sure we were available for customers.”

The Spacex CEO further questioned: “Who controls this organization, this clearinghouse?” Tenev replied: “It’s a consortium. It’s not quite a government agency. I don’t really know the details of all of that.” Nonetheless, he emphasized that “To be fair … I think there was legitimate sort of turmoil in the markets … so there probably is some amount of extra risk in the system that warrants higher requirements so it’s not entirely unreasonable.” He noted that lots of other brokers were in the same situation and had to restrict the same activity.

“So it sounds like this organization calls you up and they basically have a gun to your head: either hand over this money or else,” the Spacex CEO summarized, elaborating:

Basically, what people are wondering is did you sell your clients down the river or did you have no choice. If you had no choice, that’s understandable but then we got to find out why you had no choice and who are these people that are saying you have no choice.

“I think that’s fair. We have to comply with these requirements. Financial institutions have requirements,” Tenev responded. Nonetheless, he suggested that it would be helpful to know the formula the NSCC uses to calculate these requirements so companies can plan better.

Musk proceeded to ask about whether there was outside pressure forcing Robinhood to take the action it did. Tenev affirmed that there is “a rumor that Citadel or other market makers kind of pressured us into doing this.” However, he clarified, “that’s just false,” emphasizing that “this was a clearinghouse decision and it was just based on the capital requirements so from our perspective Citadel and other market makers weren’t involved in that.”

During the same Clubhouse interview, Elon also revealed that he is a supporter of bitcoin and should have bought the cryptocurrency eight years ago. He believes that bitcoin is on the verge of getting broad acceptance by traditional finance people. On Monday, Robinhood raised another $2.4 billion from shareholders after it secured $1 billion last Thursday.

PRESS RELEASE. The AdGram service was founded a year ago and is currently the largest advertising exchange in Telegram.

AdGram helps brands place large advertising volumes in channels and groups quickly and efficiently. Channels and groups benefit from expansion of their audience, it is easy to find advertisers and increase the earnings from advertising placements via AdGram.

Over the last 12 months, the service has gained a huge experience in communications with both advertisers and administrators from different countries, which has highlighted issues with settlements in multiple currencies. After overcoming these obstacles, it was decided that cryptocurrency could be the key to solving this problem.

With the termination of the Telegram team’s work on the TON project in May 2020 (the messenger lost one of its monetization methods), Free TON was launched which took over the development and popularization of TON Crystal using the open source code from the original TON. The uniqueness of FreeTON is that it is one of the few projects where all the tokens belong to the community and it is developing as a decentralized autonomous organization.

The potential of the underlying technology and the growth of the community inspired AdGram and in October 2020 they partnered with the FreeTON Community and fully integrated Crystal as a means of payment. Synergy with FreeTON made it possible to take a big step towards using cryptocurrencies as a single, simple and clear means of payment.

The ability to pay with tokens for advertising in Telegram creates a powerful use case for the TON Crystal token. Huge and constantly growing volume of the advertising market is vital for tokenomics as it creates supply and demand for market participants, thereby increasing the liquidity of the token itself.

For administrators and advertisers transactions in TON Crystal is simple, convenient and fast! It also solves the problem of collecting details for transfers in various currencies, and avoids paying banking fees.

Advertising on Telegram and the FreeTON blockchain, which is the successor of Durov’s original (but never happened Durov’s TON), create a strong and impact-resistant synergy of mutual benefits. This shows markets and communities can develop in a self-regulated environment.

PRESS RELEASE. CEX.IO LOAN experiences massive institutional demand for its crypto-backed lending service, with 41% of customers requesting to borrow cash against Bitcoin, 53% against Ethereum, and 6% against DeFi tokens.

Crypto-backed lending service CEX.IO LOAN that launched in October 2020 in select global jurisdictions, has been experiencing major demand, receiving over $100 million worth of loan requests to date. While the service has been widely popular among retail investors, most of the platform’s loan requests came from institutional investors.

According to CEX.IO LOAN, such an increase in demand can be attributed to the institutionalization of the cryptocurrency industry. Institutional investors, who have cryptocurrencies in their possession, regard it as a potential collateral for borrowing funds and actively utilise it as such. The borrowed funds are then used for further investment purposes.

In addition to featuring cutting-edge security and advanced anti-fraud measures, CEX.IO Group operates a regulated service, which has been licensed as a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) provider by the Gibraltar Financial Service Commission (GFSC) since last year. In addition to this, the Government of Gibraltar recently granted CEX.IO Limited a Money Lender License, allowing the firm to extend its ecosystem of regulated services with CEX.IO LOAN.

Institutional clients also prefer the company’s digital asset-backed lending service due to the convenience offered to users. On the CEX.IO LOAN platform, customers can borrow cash against their cryptocurrency assets in a quick and simple manner, without having to deal with credit checks or any unnecessary paperwork. To access the company’s instant crypto-backed lending service, new users have to open an account at the digital asset exchange and pass the mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML checks.

CEX.IO LOAN serves various cryptocurrency market participants, from retail investors, traders, and HODLers to startups, entrepreneurs, and large enterprises. As part of a flexible crypto-backed lending service, users can borrow any amount between $500 and $100,000 at competitive interest rates starting at 8.75% per year. Loan duration ranging from seven days to one year.

Currently, retail users can borrow funds against their Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) assets. Based on the company’s data, the feature has already experienced high demand from VIP clients, with 41% of all CEX.IO LOAN customers borrowing cash against Bitcoin (BTC), 53% against Ethereum (ETH), and 6% against DeFi tokens.

The company has recently introduced a VIP-exclusive feature to offer flexible lending conditions and the ability to use decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens as collateral for institutional clients on the crypto-backed lending platform.

Furthermore, to best serve institutional customers, the requests and queries of VIP clients are handled individually by dedicated personal managers on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Interestingly, 14% of CEX.IO VIP customers have already asked their personal managers about borrowing funds via the crypto-backed lending service.

“As institutional investors find the digital asset industry increasingly attractive, it’s a pleasure to serve them with our enterprise-grade instant crypto-backed loan platform. Security, convenience, and compliance are key priorities for corporate clients, which are features that we have been providing to all our clients in the rapidly growing CEX.IO ecosystem. Most importantly, we want to provide institutional clients with the best service. For that reason, VIP clients enjoy exclusive benefits, such as dedicated personal managers and flexible lending options, on the CEX.IO LOAN platform,” Anton Chashchin, Commercial Director for the CEX.IO LOAN service, stated.

In the announcement, the firm revealed further details about the size of the funds clients borrow on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Based on the company’s data, while retail investors borrow $1,400 on average, VIP clients request larger-sized loans that vary in size, with the typical amount being $1 million or higher.

Institutional clients do not just borrow more but also need the funds for more extended periods which usually range between 6 and 12 months. According to the company, this phenomenon indicates a long-term strategy for VIP clients to manage their assets.

PRESS RELEASE. PARSIQ, a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform connecting on-chain and off-chain applications in real-time, announced that its PRQ token is now listed on OKEx with USDT base pair.

Please take note of the following go-live schedule:

PRQ Deposit : 07:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Spot Trading : PRQ / USDT : 10:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Withdrawal : 10:00 January 29, 2021 (UTC)

PARSIQ is a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform that serves as a multi-level bridge between blockchains and off-chain applications. PARSIQ’s features automate the blockchain analytics and monitoring process, providing customizable workflows with real-time intelligence.

Developers and individual users can transform the blockchain data to their favorite off-chain application or web service.

Among the obvious use cases is monitoring the wallets of traders and ordinary users. Among the non-obvious are complex system integrations for financial institutions and DeFi projects that use the PARSIQ infrastructure to improve security, conduct audits, comply with regulatory requirements, AML, and expand their workflows in other ways.

The infrastructure underneath PARSIQ’s user interface is built with their proprietary programming language ParsiQL, and its users’ benefits are multiplying with each supported integration.

PRQ Token

PARSIQ Token (PRQ) is an essential piece of the PARSIQ platform that co-exists with FIAT payments for using its services. Payments within the platform that are made in PRQ tokens guarantee a discounted rate. During the first Epoch when PRQ tokens are used as payment for running Smart-Triggers users receive higher execution limits, unlock transport methods, and are able to propose features that can be added to the platform.

In October 2020, the PARSIQ team released plans for Epoch 2.0.

#1. Public Projects

With Public Projects users can subscribe to existing PARSIQ Projects that were pre-made by other users. By paying in PRQ, users that have subscribed to the Public Project will incentivize the creators to create interesting, complex, and more important – problem-solving projects.

#2. User Data and PRQ

Every single monitoring target (primitive of type address, a struct with the field of address type, table row) would require 1 PRQ to hold after the implementation. It means that if there are 1000 addresses (960 in the table as rows, 30 as primitives, 10 in the structs) then the User would need 1000 PRQ on the connected Ethereum Account balance.

#3. IQ Protocol

IQ Protocol will allow risk-free PRQ lending and collateral-less borrowing. Risk-free PRQ lending means that PRQ is not transferred from the lender’s address to the borrower’s address. Details on the algorithm are available in the dedicated explainer on PARSIQ’s blog.

#4. PRQBoost

PRQ Boost is a liquidity boost program to incentivize PRQ/ETH liquidity providers on Uniswap, which goes with the PRQBOOST utility tokens to increase rewards for liquidity providers.

PARSIQ is actively working to partner with major layer 1 blockchain protocols to expand the range of blockchain integrations and give projects that build on those protocols the ability to monitor and automate workflows between blockchain and off-chain.

PRESS RELEASE. YFX, the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts has just launched, adding an important piece to the DeFi money legos, and creating a direct competition against CEX on derivatives trading.

The most traded Bitcoin product in centralized exchanges is Bitcoin futures, which is 10 times bigger than spot trading in terms of the trading volume. But in DEX, spot trading platforms like Uniswap are occupying a large portion of the total trading volume, and there is not a single decentralized futures trading platform that could reach even 1/10 of Uniswap’s trading volume. What stops decentralized futures trading platforms from becoming 10 times bigger than Uniswap? Why are decentralized futures trading platforms performing worse than their centralized counterparts?

The main reason is that decentralized futures exchanges don’t currently provide an attractive futures product to compete with centralized futures exchanges. For instance, centralized futures exchanges like BitMex can provide 100x leverage on Bitcoin futures trading. On the other hand, decentralized futures exchanges like dYdX only offer 10x leverage. None of the decentralized exchanges can keep up with the 100x leverage offering from centralized exchanges.

YFX Descartes V1 uses QIC-AMM and a system de-risk mechanism to migrate perpetual futures trading from CEX to DEX without reducing the trading leverage, which makes YFX the first DEX that could offer 100x leverage on a perpetual contract. You can do everything on YFX that you can do on BitMex or OKEx. YFX is poised to compete directly against established centralized exchanges. YFX Descartes V1 runs on the TRON MainNet, for faster transaction times and cheaper gas fees compared to Ethereum. The YFX team is also working on Ethereum’s Layer 2 solution to provide pragmatic perpetual trading on DEX. YFX team plans to launch their DEX on Huobi Heco and Ethereum Test net in Q1, 2021.

About YFX

YFX is the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts. YFX Descartes V1 launched on the TRON MainNet, and all trades are held and processed by smart contracts. The main goal of the YFX team, which is formed by a group of engineers who have years of experience working on trading systems and blockchain, is to build a DEX that can compete with CEX on derivative trading.

The Wall Street Bets saga, an incredibly ridiculous story about a group of amateur Reddit investors who beat career Wall Street hedge funds at their own game, is to be made into a movie.

According to a report by online news site Deadline on Jan. 31, Metro Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) won the rights to produce the film in a bidding war involving major Hollywood movie houses.

The movie is to be based on a book proposed by author Ben Mezrich. Mezrich’s previous work, “The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding Of Facebook, a Tale Of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal,” was adapted into the motion picture “The Social Network.”

The title to his planned latest book offering is called “The Antisocial Network,” said the report, quoting sources familiar with the development. The book is expected to go out to publishers later this February, it said.

However, it is not yet clear what shape or structure the movie will take. MGM’s Michael DeLuca will produce the film. DeLuca also produced the Academy-Award winning The Social Network. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss will executive produce via their Winklevoss Pictures production company.

The Wall Street Bets group noticed that major hedge funds on Wall Street had been placing short bets against companies they considered to be dying. The funds particularly targeted Gamestop, the world’s largest video game retailer, continually shorting the company’s shares.

But the Redditors saw an opportunity to make profit and collectively bet the other way, buying shares and stock options. This resulted in the value of the Gamestop shares soaring by more than 2,600% in January.

Hedge funds that had shorted the stock incurred losses running into several billions of dollars. One fund, Melvin Capital, reportedly lost up to $7 billion to the “short squeeze” in January, forcing it to restructure its investment portfolio to ensure a faster escape in future “squeezes.”

The Reddit traders also extended the pump to a few other stocks considered to be dying, including AMC (which climbed over 900% in January), as well as Nokia and Blackberry. This surge of activity resulted in a major controversy when the trading app Robinhood began restricting trade on certain stocks.

Alongside the cryptocurrency’s meteoric climb over the back half of 2020 and early 2021, a curious phenomenon has unfolded; heightened profit-taking and conversion to fiat currencies. Data collected by Simplex, a fiat-crypto gateway, underscores this seemingly paradoxical development.

A Curious Race to Convert Crypto to Fiat Has Accompanied Bitcoin’s Latest Drive Higher

Sharing exclusive data with Bitcoin.com, Simplex cofounder and chief analytics officer Netanel Kabala says:

While the international press coverage of Bitcoin’s rally has caused a swathe of new users to flock to the industry and buy-in, outflows have been equally significant. Of the total amount of cryptocurrency sold in the last six months, 43% was off ramped in December alone.

A quick look at Google Trends for the term ‘Bitcoin’ echoes these developments, especially now that new equity instruments like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and big-name funds like Blackrock are adding exposure and raising crypto awareness.

Still, given the increased ability to quickly convert crypto and withdraw in fiat currencies, the uptick in funds leaving the ecosystem is astonishing. Part of this can be attributed to the growing fungibility of cryptocurrency, primarily helped by the support of players like Simplex, which empowers users to buy, sell, and spend crypto through Visa partnerships.

Although some of the latest rally’s onlookers have decried the rapid rise in crypto valuations as proof that a bubble is forming in this nascent asset class, others within the industry see the development as a harbinger of times to come. One of the areas this is most apparent is altcoins.

Data compiled by Simplex illustrates that as Bitcoin prices have leveled off above $30,000, daily purchases of altcoins have risen by approximately 65%. More interestingly, the data highlights that newer users account for nearly 20% of this volume, marking a sharp increase in the number of novice retail investors expanding and diversifying their exposure within the ecosystem.

Poloniex, one of the top 20 global cryptocurrency exchanges, which has adopted Simplex’s platform, has experienced these results firsthand. Karen McHenry, Poloniex’s Director of Product, attributes this development to greater access within the ecosystem, especially with Simplex’s buy option, which promotes instant account funding alongside the heightened ability to cash out quickly.

She also doesn’t see the ability to more quickly convert from crypto to fiat as harming interest despite the eyepopping amounts taken off exchanges.

It may sound surprising, but adding the ‘sell’ option actually has a positive impact on the number of crypto transactions too.

Though this easy offramp and soaring volume of sell orders might seem negative for prices, it can also be viewed as a healthy reflection of the ecosystem’s growing use cases. Besides making it easier to exit and enter, growing areas like decentralized finance (defi) and greater fungibility all contribute to a cryptocurrency’s value proposition.

As institutions begin lining up to add exposure as retail accumulation climbs, Bitcoin momentum may actually accelerate, and by extension, lift the altcoins sought after by the newcomers seeking opportunities outside the seminal crypto coin.

McHenry adds:

If the bull market can maintain its momentum, some of these BTC profits will flow into altcoins, which are particularly popular among retail investors. This creates a positive feedback loop, with traders who turn a profit prone to telling their friends about crypto, which brings more investment into the space.

Do you think the offramping will continue throughout 2021? Let us know in the comments sections below.

This past week, another social media trend started on the Reddit forum r/wallstreetbets, which aims to initiate a large silver short squeeze in order to push the price of the precious metal to $1,000 per ounce. However, the silver squeeze trend comes with controversy, as numerous wallstreetbets supporters believe hedge funds like Melvin Capital and Citadel are behind the silver push.

The Controversial ‘Silver Squeeze’

During the last week, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the wallstreetbets (WSB) saga taking place on social media forums and the infamous subreddit r/wallstreetbets. Since the mega short squeeze on the Gamestop (GME) shares, the squeeze maneuver has also spilled into a number of other stocks. This week, shares from the Russell 3000 Index (RUA) were targeted including tickers like NOK, GOGO, AMCX, and FIZZ. But the trend didn’t stop there, as one post, in particular, had called for a “silver squeeze.” The WSB Reddit post called for the silver squeeze to push the price of silver from $25 per ounce to $1,000.

Now since the post was published, the Reddit admins in charge of moderating r/wallstreetbets removed the post. But that was long after the message was made viral by the participants discussing the pros and cons of attempting to squeeze silver. Now the reason people think the silver short squeeze post may be shady, is because a number of WSB Redditors believe the silver squeeze was invoked by the hedge funds losing money in order to cover their GME losses. There are a great number of Reddit posts warning that people should not participate in the silver short squeeze.

One post said:

Citadel is the 5th largest owner of [silver], it’s imperative we do not ‘squeeze’ it. These are hedge fund bots spamming awards.

The people who dislike the silver trend on WSB, have also warned that Melvin Capital Management is also a big silver holder. Unfortunately, it is hard to tell where the silver pump threads and posts are stemming from, as there are many free-market supporters who are fans of the precious metal sometimes referred to as the ‘poor man’s gold.’

Despite this, there are numbers of WSB fans and Redditors claiming the silver pump stemmed from hedge fund people and they believe there are imposters everywhere now. Some of these people are growing irrational, getting mad at anyone who posts about silver. Many WSB supporters might be feeling the pain from Gamestop Corp. shares dropping significantly on Monday.

Silver soars past $30 a troy ounce as Reddit-fuelled buying frenzy continues for 3rd day. #Silversqueeze pic.twitter.com/mLmasUBrq1 — Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) February 1, 2021

In Spite of Controversy, Something Is Sparking Silver Demand

Despite the speculation, some sort of demand was invoked when it comes to silver prices and obtaining physical bullion. For instance, if you are attempting to purchase an ounce or ounces of silver bullion online, the process is far more complicated now than it was last week. A large portion of bars and coins are either sold out or the prices are marked up considerably.

This is simple arbitrage. #Silver futures are 28.67. Silver Eagles on Apmex are $41.66, thats a 45% premium to futures. Obvious opportunity to buy futures & stand for delivery for a 35% discount on physical right? But when they don't have it, Futures = $41.66/oz. #silversqueeze — Jonathan #SILVERSQUEEZE Mergott (@Jmergz1985) February 1, 2021

All the American Eagles are sold out across a number of bullion dealers. On Sunday morning, a few big-name dealers have halted a great number of silver sales. News.Bitcoin.com’s most recent WSB report disclosed how SD Bullion sold nearly 10x the number of silver ounces than usual. People visiting bullion dealer websites like Provident, Apmex, and JD Bullion could see the unprecedented demand targeting physical silver.

“In the last week, we have seen a dramatic shift in Silver demand from our customers,” said Ken Lewis CEO of the bullion dealer Apmex. “For example, the ratio of ounces sold per day was running about two times earlier in the week and closer to four times the average demand by the end of the week,” Lewis added.

The Apmex CEO further stressed:

Once markets closed on Friday, we saw demand hit as much as six times a typical business day and more than 12 times a normal weekend day. Combined with the extremely high demand levels, we are also seeing a surge in new customers. On Saturday alone, we added as many new customers as we usually add in a week.

Additionally, the hashtag “#silversqueeze” has been trending throughout the United States and a few other countries on Twitter during the last 48 hours. By the late afternoon on Sunday, spot silver and futures traded at $27 per Troy ounce, and by Monday morning spot silver traded 7.7% higher at $29.76. The commodity hopped above the $30 region, and silver prices per ounce exchanged hands at $30.35 an ounce. One ounce of .999 silver is hovering in the $29 price handle at the time of publication

CHAPTER ONE: Listening to the Past

“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.” — Satoshi Nakamoto

The trusted third party problem has haunted modern financial systems and centralized exchanges because people require an intermediary to make them work. The third party’s good or bad motives become a defining aspect of the transaction, and the those who use the institutions are at the mercy of those intentions. This is especially true of the current system of state-issued money and central banking.

A trustless system avoids intermediaries and does not depend upon the intentions of participants; that is, the system functions in the same manner regardless of anyone’s intentions. The blockchain, with a transparent and immutable peer-to peer protocol, is called trustless because there is no corruptible intermediary upon whom exchanges must depend.

On a small scale, the trusted third party problem may always exist because a middleman is useful or necessary in some situations. If third parties offer competitive services on a free market, however, the damage of dishonesty or incompetence is limited. People can take their business elsewhere, report a swindler to watchdogs, warn others, and file a lawsuit.

An occasionally dishonest third party is not the problem Satoshi addresses. He speaks to the institutionalized corruption of government and central banks from which the average person could not escape by using a competitor or by suing. Almost everyone who works over the table, runs a business, buys or sells goods, accepts government benefits or pays taxes has had to accept a fiat that constantly plunges in value due to inflation. Almost everyone who uses credit, accepts checks, takes out loans, conducts commerce or does business abroad has needed to go through banks that steal like drunken muggers.

For average people, the situation used to seem hopeless because no legal, practical, and private alternative existed for transferring funds across considerable distance, including borders. Attempts to reform or remove the system also seemed doomed because it was inherently corrupt and self-serving. In fact, fiat and central banking were serving the purpose for which they had been established: financial control by elites. People’s need for money and exchange became their straitjackets.

Then Satoshi. Then the blockchain and crypto. A new concept of money was created in a form that cannot not be inflated; the number of bitcoins is fixed at 21 million divisible units. The supply can only decrease when coins are lost, as inevitably happens. Satoshi notes, “Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.” Bitcoin solved the fiat problem.

A new concept of financial transfer solved the third party problem, especially with regard to banks. Although peer-to-peer transactions involve a middleman or miner, no trust is required since the transaction is released only when “proof of work” is rendered, which consists of solving a complicated math problem. Arriving at a solution may be costly in computer power and time, but the solutions themselves are easy to verify. Satoshi comments, “With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.” The soundness and propriety of the blockchain’s protocol itself is assured by the use of open source that is visible to all and verifiable. The political outcome: A private currency and method of exchange freed people from financial oppression.

The idea of private currency itself is hardly new, however.

Precedent in Radical Individualist Theory

The late Friedrich Hayek is the most respected Austrian economist of the 20th century. His book The Denationalisation of Money: An Analysis of the Theory and Practice of Concurrent Currencies argues vigorously for private and competitive currencies to displace government-issued ones. Hayek ponders a key question. “When one studies the history of money one cannot help wondering why people should have put up for so long with governments exercising an exclusive power over two thousand years that was regularly used to exploit and defraud them. This can be explained only by the myth” that government money was necessary “becoming so firmly established that it did not occur even to the professional students of these matters…ever to question it. But once the validity of the established doctrine is doubted its foundation is rapidly seen to be fragile.”

Governments reap incredible profits from debasing the currency, but the rigged game works only if people have no alternative but to play it. The political purpose of legal tender and banking laws is to grant a monopoly to the state, which permits the redistribution of wealth and power from average people upward to the elite of society. Fiat money and banking remains fragile, however, because the system relies on people either not understanding the dynamics or not having a choice. Hayek wonders why public understanding is so elusive. Why was “a government monopoly of the provision of money…universally regarded as indispensable” and what would happen “if the provision of money were thrown open to the competition of private concerns supplying different currencies?”

With eerie prescience, Hayek argues for currencies developed by entrepreneurs who innovate new forms of money just as they innovate in other areas. One of the drawbacks of government’s monopoly is that it imposes a freeze on the sort of invention that now runs free in crypto. The voluntaryist historian Carl Watner observes, “No one can tell in advance what form these monies might take because no one can know for sure what choices individuals would make or what new technologies might be discovered. Laws forcing people to use the Federal Reserve System money have frozen monetary developments at a certain stage…Just imagine if Congress had protected the Post Office by passing laws that would have prevented people from communicating via the internet. We would never have experienced the marvels of e-mail.”

The late Austrian economist Murray Rothbard also wrestles with the question of “why do people so vigorously resist private currencies?” His book For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto advances an explanation. “If the government and only the government had had a monopoly of the shoe manufacturing and retailing business, how would most of the public treat the libertarian who now came along to advocate that the government get out of the shoe business and throw it open to private enterprise?” Rothbard predicts that the skeptics would attack the libertarian for depriving them of the only possible source of shoes—the government. People are thoroughly indoctrinated to believe that daily life cannot function without the state and fiat.

Hayek and Rothbard are unusual among free-market economists in their embrace of private money and monetary systems. Even laissez-faire zealots rarely champion free-market currencies or private banking. Instead, they debate marginal issues such as fractional reserve and other reforms they think will improve the existing system. Or they argue for the restoration of a gold standard as though it were a panacea. But if a gold standard were applied to fiat, the system would still require people to trust the government and banks. This means trusting both institutions to act against their own interests, which they have historically neglected to do.

The modern neglect of free-market money and banking is odd because 19th century radical individualists focused intensely on the importance of private money and private banking to personal freedom. They placed a primal emphasis on the right of every individual to create his own currency and to function as his own bank. It was a natural right as important as freedom of speech or of religion. The pivotal individualist Benjamin Tucker believed that the right to issue private currency was so important that it could destroy the State all by itself. His reasoning: The money monopoly, including control of credit, was how the State sustained itself and robbed average people not merely of wealth but also of economic opportunity.

Two specific events sculpted the approach that the early individualist-anarchists adopted toward the monetary monopoly. One was the Panic of 1837 that tipped the United States into recession until the mid-1840s. Commonly cited causes of the Panic include a collapsing land bubble and a sharp fall in cotton prices. Blame is also placed at the feet of President Andrew Jackson for vetoing the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States and precipitating an unfortunate chain of economic events. Drawing on the work of Professor of Economics Peter Temin, Rothbard disputes this interpretation.

First, he [Temin] points out that the price inflation really began earlier, when wholesale prices reached a trough of 82 in July 1830 and then rose by 20.7 percent in three years to reach 99 in the fall of 1833. The reason for the price rise is simple: The total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $159 million in 1833, an increase of 45.9 percent, or an annual rise of 15.3 percent. Breaking the figures down further, the total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $155 million a year and a half later, a spectacular expansion of 35 percent. Unquestionably, this monetary expansion was spurred by the still-flourishing Bank of the United States, which increased its notes and deposits from January 1830 to January 1832 from a total of $29 million to $42.1 million, a rise of 45.2 percent. Thus, the price and money inflation in the first few years of the 1830s were again sparked by the expansion of the still-dominant central bank.

Arguably, the Panic began in May 1837 when banks in New York City announced they would not redeem commercial paper for specie at full face value. Of the approximately 800 banks in America, all but six ceased at one point or another to redeem banknotes and deposits for gold or silver coins. Suspicion and hatred of traditional banks and government-issued money soared, with radicals scrutinizing alternate systems.

The other event dramatically to impact the radical fever from monetary reform was the Civil War for which the North financed its fighting through Legal Tender Acts and the National Banking Act of 1863.

The radicals did not merely theorize; they experimented with private currencies and new economic models. Their efforts are fascinating, but they are also cautionary tales. A major problem for 19th-century individualist-anarchism was the movement’s general acceptance of a link between sound money and the labor theory of value. This theory states that the true value of a good or service is based on the labor required to produce it rather than the price at which a seller and buyer are willing to exchange. In short, a good has intrinsic and not subjective value. (More on this in the section on the Regression Theorem.) Happily, their main economic goal was the abolition of the “money monopoly.” The term referred to three different but interacting forms of monopoly: banking, the charging of interest, and the privileged issuance of currency. The abolition of state power over currency was the focus, and they eschewed the use of force to implement their own schemes.

Josiah Warren provided a real-world example of what was meant by a currency that rested on the labor theory of value. Credited with being the first American anarchist, Warren tested his specific solution to the money monopoly through a Time Store from which he issued “Labor Notes.” In 1827, the business opened with $300 worth of groceries and dry goods that were offered at a 7 percent markup from Warren’s own costs in order to cover expenses such as overhead. This was before groceries were prepackaged or preweighed, and it was usual for buyers to bargain with the shopkeeper rather than pay a posted price. One of

Warren’s innovations was to post prices, which drove costs lower because transactions consumed less time. The customer paid in traditional money for the goods and paid with a Labor Note to compensate Warren for his time. The Labor Note obliged the customer to provide Warren with an equivalent amount of his time. If the buyer was a seamstress, for example, the Labor Note committed her to render to Warren X units of time to produce clothing. Warren’s goal was to establish an economy—or to establish a proof of principle, at least—in which profit was based on the exchange of time and labor. The Labor Notes were circulated and traded widely with in the community.

To some degree, Warren succeeded. People traveled from a hundred miles away to avail themselves of the Time Store’s low prices. After a few years, he declared the experiment to be a success and closed the store. Whether the Labor Notes were a success is questionable, however. The store itself may well have succeeded due to its low prices, not to the Notes. Whichever explanation is true, it is difficult to see how this novel currency could function in dense populations or on a grander scale of commerce. Few people today would be convinced of the viability of private money based on the Time Store experiment.

What could convince the public and economists that private currencies work as well or better than government-issued ones? Going back a bit further in American history is a good place to start because the future is always based on the past.

21Shares AG, a Zurich-based investment provider, is launching what is being dubbed as the world’s first Polkadot exchange-traded product, or ETP.

The DOT ETP will be listed on the Swiss exchange SIX on Thursday, February 4, said the company in a statement on Tuesday. DOT is the native token of the Polkadot network.

DOT has since been added to 21Shares’ Crypto Basket ETP (HODL), which tracks five major assets including bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH). Since its addition on Jan. 29, DOT now accounts for 27% of the product behind BTC at 50%.

Hany Rashwan, chief executive officer of 21Shares, said the firm has seen “unprecedented demand” from institutional investors wanting exposure to crypto-assets. He stated that demand for its range of crypto ETPs has soared 500% since the third quarter of 2020, but there has been “a recent surge in interest” for DOT.

“After investors purchase their first bitcoins through our ETPs, there is a natural transition to invest in other crypto assets,” Rashwan detailed.

“We benefit from trusted partners for the liquidity provision and upon continued institutional demand, we are launching the DOT ETP to give investors a safe, regulated, and easy way to obtain exposure to this exciting new blockchain technology,” he added.

Rashwan revealed that 21Shares, an issuer of exchange-traded products, is planning to add up to three ETPs over the next 3 months. He said European investors have been approaching the company to launch new products.

Created by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Polkadot is a cross-blockchain that enables transfers of any type of data or asset, not just tokens. It is also used as an electronic payment system.

DOT is now the world’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market capitalization of $16.55 billion, according to data from markets.Bitcoin.com. At the time of writing, DOT is trading at $17.22, up 8% over the past 24 hours.

Ukraine’s government-owned nuclear power plant picked a firm to build a massive data center in Rivne for cryptocurrency mining operations. After a bidding process, Energoatom chose Kyiv Energy Construction Company to handle the nuclear plant crypto mining project.

Nuclear Power Plant Operator Expects to Launch the Data Center in 2022

According to official documents, the data center will be based in the Rivne nuclear power plant, after the construction firm got 8.92 million Hryvnia ($317,620) in funding. The only competitor in the bidding was Ukrenergobudproek. However, they allegedly made an expensive offer, said the regional news outlet Forklog.

The Kyiv Energy Construction Company expects to finish the data center building by August 31, 2022. Per the announcement, the contractor is required to send the documentation that details the whole process. It includes “host state registers, electronic archives, and computing facilities.”

In terms of technical details, the nuclear power plant has a capacity of 2,657 megawatts, and it was built in the late 1970s. Also, the operations of the state-owned nuclear facilities started at the beginning of 1980.

In October 2020, Energoatom also signed a memorandum with a subsidiary of crypto mining giant Bitfury. With the new data center, local media outlets believe Bitfury miners could move their operations into the power plant’s facilities.

Ukraine’s Interest Towards Building Crypto Mining Data Centers in Nuclear Plants

The deal between Energoatom and Kyiv Energy Construction Company is not a surprising move. In fact, the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine asked Energoatom in May 2020 to conduct research to assess crypto mining’s feasibility at their nuclear plants.

As an anecdotal fact in terms of crypto mining in Ukrainian nuclear plants, the nation’s Security Service found illegal crypto mining equipment in a nuclear power plant in 2019.

The installation’s illegal mining rigs were found in the Southern region of Ukraine. Moreover, the investigations determined that such illegal equipment breached a “state secret.”

Global music distribution service Ditto has unveiled the latest addition to its service lineup for musicians with a blockchain-based financing platform named Opulous.

Opulous Peer-to-Peer Lending Platform Serves as a Loan Pool Designed to Help Artists

Ditto continues its efforts to improve the value chain for artists. Unlike other decentralized finance (defi) protocols, Opulous reflects asset-based lending, which bridges the physical and digital worlds. The Opulous’ defi lending mechanism, which is being developed on the Algorand public blockchain, leverages music copyrights’ tangibility through a smart contract setup that automatically handles principal and interest payments along with distributions to investors.

For musicians already receiving royalties, this presents a unique opportunity to monetize their assets or contribute to the pool to stake other artists. When seeking capital, artists can access funds by collateralizing loans from Opulous’ Music Copyright Pools with their music royalties.

Besides digitizing music as an asset class, the move will invite more democratized participation from artists and investors seeking to gain a foothold in the music industry, which is undergoing tremendous annual growth and expected to double in size by 2030. Artists benefit from interest rates starting as low as 4%, while investors in the copyright pools can add exposure to music royalties as an asset class for 10% returns per annum.

Per Ditto CEO Lee Parsons,

Opulous cuts out traditional banking, providing musicians with a platform with minimal interest payments, while giving investors the chance to stake a claim in one of the most exciting and fastest-growing financial industries in the world.

Ditto, which has already processed more than $1 billion in royalties for its 250,000-plus users, sees industry revenues doubling in the next ten years, building a compelling investment thesis. In keeping with Opulous’ mission to democratize musicians’ financial access, users outside the Ditto ecosystem are welcome to join the peer-to-peer lending framework.

Opulous has raised $1.5 million in funding to-date from BASIC, Borderless Capital, Kosmos Capital, Somesing, and TrustVerse. Roll out of the platform’s minimum viable product (MVP) is anticipated in two months as development proceeds.

Elastos, which built its decentralized application (dapp) platform and currency (ELA) to protect users’ digital assets and creations, will be among the first token staking partners for Opulous’ proof-of-stake consensus protocol. Opulous, in concert with Elastos, will allow investors to stake their Elastos (ELA) coins within the Music Copyright Pools.

According to Clarence Liu, the VP of Development at the Elastos Foundation,

Elastos and Ditto Music have been researching how blockchain can address fundamental inefficiencies in the music industry. Access to funding – which Opulous will address – is only the tip of the iceberg.

“Our collaboration has much more in the pipeline and our community is definitely set on using the forward momentum sparked by recent world events to introduce new users to the decentralized internet ideals set by Elastos,” Liu concludes.

During the last year, Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem has grown exponentially to form a multi Billion Dollar market. As Decentralized Finance expands, it becomes more and more relevant to have cross-chain connections that enable crypto assets to flow instantly and seamlessly across blockchain networks. These make it possible for DeFi platforms to be an effective alternative to centralized exchanges. Today, pNetwork launches the first EOS to Ethereum cross-chain connection to enable the EOS crypto asset to be moved into Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem.

EOS on Ethereum

EOS, the native token on the EOS blockchain, is a top20 cryptocurrency by market cap and the engine powering one of the most active dApps ecosystems. The asset counts over $ 3.5 Billion in daily trading volumes, figuring as the 9th most traded cryptocurrency. At present, only a fraction of the total is happening in a decentralized fashion.

While the DeFi ecosystem on EOS continues to grow, it has not yet reached Ethereum’s size. The latter powers Billions in daily trading volumes, Uniswap being the largestlarges liquidity protocol in existence and the fourth biggest DeFi protocol in terms of Total Value Locked.

Following the delivery of 26 bridges connecting six different blockchain protocols, including the cross-chain transfer of popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin, pNetwork launches today a new cross-chain connection that brings EOS to Ethereum.

As the first tokenised version of EOS, pEOS makes the asset compatible with Ethereum’s DeFi. This creates a benefit on both sides, enabling Ethereum’s DeFi protocols to expand their range of assets supported and granting EOS the option to be traded in a decentralized fashion as well as being supported as a collateral type by major Ethereum-based landing platforms.

Cross-chain connections are critical for a variety of use-cases, from NFTs to market making to decentralized indexes such as PieDAO’s Pies. pNetwork-powered asset tokenisation on Ethereum enables such indexes to represent the entire crypto market.

All pTokenised assets are pegged 1:1 to their underlying asset and are available for automated minting or redeeming on the pTokens dApp. In addition, pTokens are supported on a variety of DeFi protocols, decentralized exchanges and wallets on a growing number of blockchains.

Making Ethereum and EOS dApps Interoperable

Ethereum and EOS are two of the most active ecosystems for dApps, counting thousands of users each. By connecting these two blockchain environments, pNetwork aims to support the growth and development of decentralized applications such as lending/borrowing, trading, derivatives, and more. Acting as a cross-chain highway for cryptocurrencies to frictionlessly move from one blockchain to another, pNetwork powers the first bi-directional connection between the Ethereum and EOS blockchains.

Users on either blockchain are now able to interact with both ecosystems without ever leaving their blockchain of choice. Projects from both Ethereum and EOS communities have developed building blocks to create the next-generation financial system – with the connection between these two, users will find an even more powerful DeFi ecosystem.

By leveraging pNetwork’s cross-chain solution, dApps on the two blockchain platforms now have the opportunity to interoperate. Each ecosystem leveraging its counterpart’s strengths ultimately creates a benefit on both sides and sets the basis for sustainable growth. The presence of an EOS/ETH decentralized trading pair both with Ethereum’s and EOS’s decentralized finance, for example, makes it possible for market makers to arbitrage between the two blockchains. This results in a more liquid decentralized market for both assets.

As the so-called ‘meme coin’ is actively making the headlines within the crypto sphere, a publicly-traded company is joining the dogecoin frenzy. Kronos Advanced Technology announced they’ll start accepting dogecoin as one of its payment methods.

Kronos Also Accepts Other Cryptocurrencies Such as Bitcoin and Ether

According to the announcement, the Los Angeles-based firm is adding dogecoin (DOGE) to its accepted payment form. In fact, customers will be able to purchase air purifiers, and personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies via the meme coin.

Adopting dogecoin as a payment method was not as part as just of a crypto adoption-driven maneuver. The company praised the popularity of the token and its uniqueness within the industry.

Also, Kronos pointed out that dogecoins transactions’ speed is a positive note for the Shiba Inu inspired meme token. So far, the company accepts several cryptos as payment methods, such as bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), litecoin (LTC), among others.

Expanding N95 Mask Market Into the Dogecoin Community

Michael Rubinov, president of Kronos Advanced Technologies, commented on the company’s stance towards cryptocurrencies:

In the last ten years, much has been said about how cryptocurrency will revolutionize payments, services, businesses and will change the world the way we know it. Cryptocurrency has changed e-commerce: as more and more people now shop online. Cryptocurrency gives customers more reasons to utilize the convenience of online shopping, as it mitigates the risk of fraud for both vendors and shoppers.

By adopting dogecoin as a form of payment, Kronos also expect to market N95 masks to the entire meme coin community on Reddit, which has grown over 670,000 members. The company also praised the fact that Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk endorses dogecoin as one of his favorite cryptocurrencies.

Despite the recent frenzy seen in the meme coin, the latest markets.Bitcoin.com data shows that dogecoin is exchanging hands at $0.0317, down -20.43% on Tuesday. The market capitalization still stands at $4.08 billion.

Spacex and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been trying to get to the bottom of what happened with the popular trading app Robinhood when it stopped people from buying shares of hot stocks, like Gamestop. The shares of these stocks became popular due to the Wallstreetbets movement.

Elon Musk Says People Want the Truth From Robinhood

During an interview on The Good Time Show via the Clubhouse app Sunday night, Elon Musk grilled the CEO of trading app Robinhood, Vlad Tenev, over the company’s decision to restrict hot stocks last week, including Gamestop. On Friday, Robinhood also restricted crypto trading, citing “extraordinary market conditions.”

“What happened last week? Why can’t people buy the Gamestop shares? The people demand an answer and they want to know the details and the truth,” Musk said.

Tenev began by explaining the structure of his company. “Robinhood is actually a couple of companies,” he described. Robinhood Financial processes trades, Robinhood Securities clears and settles the trades, and Robinhood Crypto which deals with crypto trades.

The Robinhood CEO detailed that last Wednesday, his platform experienced “unprecedented volume” as “a lot of these so-called meme stocks were going viral on social media and people were joining Robinhood” to buy these stocks. Consequently, the company “received a file” from the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) Thursday morning at about 3:30 AM PST. It requested Robinhood to “put up money to the NSCC based on some factors,” including the volatility of certain securities. Tenev clarified that “this is the equities business so it’s based on stock trading and not options trading or anything else,” elaborating:

They gave us a file with a deposit and the request was around $3 billion dollars which is about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is.

Musk interrupted Tenev, questioning: “Why is that so high? It sounds like this is an unprecedented increase in demand for capital. What formula did they use to calculate that?”

Tenev replied: “We don’t have the full details. It’s a little bit of an opaque formula but there’s a component called the VAR of it, which is the Value at Risk, and that’s based on kind of some fairly quantitative things … and then there’s a special component which is discretionary so that kind of acts as a multiplier.” Tenev also noted that up until that point, his company “has raised a little bit around two billion dollars in total venture capital,” so the request was “a big number.”

The Tesla CEO interrupted again, asking: “What everyone wants to know is did something maybe shady go down here? It seems weird that you’d get a sudden $10 billion demand in the morning … suddenly out of nowhere.” Tenev swiftly corrected Musk that the number was $3 billion. The Robinhood CEO then emphasized:

I wouldn’t impugn shadiness to it or anything like that, and actually the NSCC was reasonable subsequent to this. They worked with us to actually lower it. It was unprecedented activity.

Musk abruptly asked Tenev: “Is there anyone holding you hostage right now?” Tenev chuckled and replied: “No, no, I’m okay. Thanks for asking.” Both laughed.

The Robinhood CEO proceeded to explain what happened, calling the experience “nerve-wrecking.” He said after receiving the request for $3 billion, his chief operating officer called up someone higher up at the NSCC to discuss what to do. “There was another call and they lowered it to something like $1.4 billion from $3 billion,” Tenev reiterated that it was still a high number. His company then proposed a plan to the NSCC of “marking these volatile stocks that were kind of driving the activity position-closing only.”

Then, at about 5 to 5:30 AM PST, before the market opened, the NSCC came back and reduced the deposit requirement to $700 million, “which we then deposited and paid promptly,” Tenev emphasized. Acknowledging that the move was bad for customers, the Robinhood CEO said, “We had no choice, in this case. We had to conform to our regulatory capital requirements and so the team did what they could to make sure we were available for customers.”

The Spacex CEO further questioned: “Who controls this organization, this clearinghouse?” Tenev replied: “It’s a consortium. It’s not quite a government agency. I don’t really know the details of all of that.” Nonetheless, he emphasized that “To be fair … I think there was legitimate sort of turmoil in the markets … so there probably is some amount of extra risk in the system that warrants higher requirements so it’s not entirely unreasonable.” He noted that lots of other brokers were in the same situation and had to restrict the same activity.

“So it sounds like this organization calls you up and they basically have a gun to your head: either hand over this money or else,” the Spacex CEO summarized, elaborating:

Basically, what people are wondering is did you sell your clients down the river or did you have no choice. If you had no choice, that’s understandable but then we got to find out why you had no choice and who are these people that are saying you have no choice.

“I think that’s fair. We have to comply with these requirements. Financial institutions have requirements,” Tenev responded. Nonetheless, he suggested that it would be helpful to know the formula the NSCC uses to calculate these requirements so companies can plan better.

Musk proceeded to ask about whether there was outside pressure forcing Robinhood to take the action it did. Tenev affirmed that there is “a rumor that Citadel or other market makers kind of pressured us into doing this.” However, he clarified, “that’s just false,” emphasizing that “this was a clearinghouse decision and it was just based on the capital requirements so from our perspective Citadel and other market makers weren’t involved in that.”

During the same Clubhouse interview, Elon also revealed that he is a supporter of bitcoin and should have bought the cryptocurrency eight years ago. He believes that bitcoin is on the verge of getting broad acceptance by traditional finance people. On Monday, Robinhood raised another $2.4 billion from shareholders after it secured $1 billion last Thursday.

PRESS RELEASE. The AdGram service was founded a year ago and is currently the largest advertising exchange in Telegram.

AdGram helps brands place large advertising volumes in channels and groups quickly and efficiently. Channels and groups benefit from expansion of their audience, it is easy to find advertisers and increase the earnings from advertising placements via AdGram.

Over the last 12 months, the service has gained a huge experience in communications with both advertisers and administrators from different countries, which has highlighted issues with settlements in multiple currencies. After overcoming these obstacles, it was decided that cryptocurrency could be the key to solving this problem.

With the termination of the Telegram team’s work on the TON project in May 2020 (the messenger lost one of its monetization methods), Free TON was launched which took over the development and popularization of TON Crystal using the open source code from the original TON. The uniqueness of FreeTON is that it is one of the few projects where all the tokens belong to the community and it is developing as a decentralized autonomous organization.

The potential of the underlying technology and the growth of the community inspired AdGram and in October 2020 they partnered with the FreeTON Community and fully integrated Crystal as a means of payment. Synergy with FreeTON made it possible to take a big step towards using cryptocurrencies as a single, simple and clear means of payment.

The ability to pay with tokens for advertising in Telegram creates a powerful use case for the TON Crystal token. Huge and constantly growing volume of the advertising market is vital for tokenomics as it creates supply and demand for market participants, thereby increasing the liquidity of the token itself.

For administrators and advertisers transactions in TON Crystal is simple, convenient and fast! It also solves the problem of collecting details for transfers in various currencies, and avoids paying banking fees.

Advertising on Telegram and the FreeTON blockchain, which is the successor of Durov’s original (but never happened Durov’s TON), create a strong and impact-resistant synergy of mutual benefits. This shows markets and communities can develop in a self-regulated environment.

PRESS RELEASE. CEX.IO LOAN experiences massive institutional demand for its crypto-backed lending service, with 41% of customers requesting to borrow cash against Bitcoin, 53% against Ethereum, and 6% against DeFi tokens.

Crypto-backed lending service CEX.IO LOAN that launched in October 2020 in select global jurisdictions, has been experiencing major demand, receiving over $100 million worth of loan requests to date. While the service has been widely popular among retail investors, most of the platform’s loan requests came from institutional investors.

According to CEX.IO LOAN, such an increase in demand can be attributed to the institutionalization of the cryptocurrency industry. Institutional investors, who have cryptocurrencies in their possession, regard it as a potential collateral for borrowing funds and actively utilise it as such. The borrowed funds are then used for further investment purposes.

In addition to featuring cutting-edge security and advanced anti-fraud measures, CEX.IO Group operates a regulated service, which has been licensed as a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) provider by the Gibraltar Financial Service Commission (GFSC) since last year. In addition to this, the Government of Gibraltar recently granted CEX.IO Limited a Money Lender License, allowing the firm to extend its ecosystem of regulated services with CEX.IO LOAN.

Institutional clients also prefer the company’s digital asset-backed lending service due to the convenience offered to users. On the CEX.IO LOAN platform, customers can borrow cash against their cryptocurrency assets in a quick and simple manner, without having to deal with credit checks or any unnecessary paperwork. To access the company’s instant crypto-backed lending service, new users have to open an account at the digital asset exchange and pass the mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML checks.

CEX.IO LOAN serves various cryptocurrency market participants, from retail investors, traders, and HODLers to startups, entrepreneurs, and large enterprises. As part of a flexible crypto-backed lending service, users can borrow any amount between $500 and $100,000 at competitive interest rates starting at 8.75% per year. Loan duration ranging from seven days to one year.

Currently, retail users can borrow funds against their Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) assets. Based on the company’s data, the feature has already experienced high demand from VIP clients, with 41% of all CEX.IO LOAN customers borrowing cash against Bitcoin (BTC), 53% against Ethereum (ETH), and 6% against DeFi tokens.

The company has recently introduced a VIP-exclusive feature to offer flexible lending conditions and the ability to use decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens as collateral for institutional clients on the crypto-backed lending platform.

Furthermore, to best serve institutional customers, the requests and queries of VIP clients are handled individually by dedicated personal managers on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Interestingly, 14% of CEX.IO VIP customers have already asked their personal managers about borrowing funds via the crypto-backed lending service.

“As institutional investors find the digital asset industry increasingly attractive, it’s a pleasure to serve them with our enterprise-grade instant crypto-backed loan platform. Security, convenience, and compliance are key priorities for corporate clients, which are features that we have been providing to all our clients in the rapidly growing CEX.IO ecosystem. Most importantly, we want to provide institutional clients with the best service. For that reason, VIP clients enjoy exclusive benefits, such as dedicated personal managers and flexible lending options, on the CEX.IO LOAN platform,” Anton Chashchin, Commercial Director for the CEX.IO LOAN service, stated.

In the announcement, the firm revealed further details about the size of the funds clients borrow on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Based on the company’s data, while retail investors borrow $1,400 on average, VIP clients request larger-sized loans that vary in size, with the typical amount being $1 million or higher.

Institutional clients do not just borrow more but also need the funds for more extended periods which usually range between 6 and 12 months. According to the company, this phenomenon indicates a long-term strategy for VIP clients to manage their assets.

PRESS RELEASE. PARSIQ, a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform connecting on-chain and off-chain applications in real-time, announced that its PRQ token is now listed on OKEx with USDT base pair.

Please take note of the following go-live schedule:

PRQ Deposit : 07:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Spot Trading : PRQ / USDT : 10:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Withdrawal : 10:00 January 29, 2021 (UTC)

PARSIQ is a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform that serves as a multi-level bridge between blockchains and off-chain applications. PARSIQ’s features automate the blockchain analytics and monitoring process, providing customizable workflows with real-time intelligence.

Developers and individual users can transform the blockchain data to their favorite off-chain application or web service.

Among the obvious use cases is monitoring the wallets of traders and ordinary users. Among the non-obvious are complex system integrations for financial institutions and DeFi projects that use the PARSIQ infrastructure to improve security, conduct audits, comply with regulatory requirements, AML, and expand their workflows in other ways.

The infrastructure underneath PARSIQ’s user interface is built with their proprietary programming language ParsiQL, and its users’ benefits are multiplying with each supported integration.

PRQ Token

PARSIQ Token (PRQ) is an essential piece of the PARSIQ platform that co-exists with FIAT payments for using its services. Payments within the platform that are made in PRQ tokens guarantee a discounted rate. During the first Epoch when PRQ tokens are used as payment for running Smart-Triggers users receive higher execution limits, unlock transport methods, and are able to propose features that can be added to the platform.

In October 2020, the PARSIQ team released plans for Epoch 2.0.

#1. Public Projects

With Public Projects users can subscribe to existing PARSIQ Projects that were pre-made by other users. By paying in PRQ, users that have subscribed to the Public Project will incentivize the creators to create interesting, complex, and more important – problem-solving projects.

#2. User Data and PRQ

Every single monitoring target (primitive of type address, a struct with the field of address type, table row) would require 1 PRQ to hold after the implementation. It means that if there are 1000 addresses (960 in the table as rows, 30 as primitives, 10 in the structs) then the User would need 1000 PRQ on the connected Ethereum Account balance.

#3. IQ Protocol

IQ Protocol will allow risk-free PRQ lending and collateral-less borrowing. Risk-free PRQ lending means that PRQ is not transferred from the lender’s address to the borrower’s address. Details on the algorithm are available in the dedicated explainer on PARSIQ’s blog.

#4. PRQBoost

PRQ Boost is a liquidity boost program to incentivize PRQ/ETH liquidity providers on Uniswap, which goes with the PRQBOOST utility tokens to increase rewards for liquidity providers.

PARSIQ is actively working to partner with major layer 1 blockchain protocols to expand the range of blockchain integrations and give projects that build on those protocols the ability to monitor and automate workflows between blockchain and off-chain.

PRESS RELEASE. YFX, the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts has just launched, adding an important piece to the DeFi money legos, and creating a direct competition against CEX on derivatives trading.

The most traded Bitcoin product in centralized exchanges is Bitcoin futures, which is 10 times bigger than spot trading in terms of the trading volume. But in DEX, spot trading platforms like Uniswap are occupying a large portion of the total trading volume, and there is not a single decentralized futures trading platform that could reach even 1/10 of Uniswap’s trading volume. What stops decentralized futures trading platforms from becoming 10 times bigger than Uniswap? Why are decentralized futures trading platforms performing worse than their centralized counterparts?

The main reason is that decentralized futures exchanges don’t currently provide an attractive futures product to compete with centralized futures exchanges. For instance, centralized futures exchanges like BitMex can provide 100x leverage on Bitcoin futures trading. On the other hand, decentralized futures exchanges like dYdX only offer 10x leverage. None of the decentralized exchanges can keep up with the 100x leverage offering from centralized exchanges.

YFX Descartes V1 uses QIC-AMM and a system de-risk mechanism to migrate perpetual futures trading from CEX to DEX without reducing the trading leverage, which makes YFX the first DEX that could offer 100x leverage on a perpetual contract. You can do everything on YFX that you can do on BitMex or OKEx. YFX is poised to compete directly against established centralized exchanges. YFX Descartes V1 runs on the TRON MainNet, for faster transaction times and cheaper gas fees compared to Ethereum. The YFX team is also working on Ethereum’s Layer 2 solution to provide pragmatic perpetual trading on DEX. YFX team plans to launch their DEX on Huobi Heco and Ethereum Test net in Q1, 2021.

About YFX

YFX is the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts. YFX Descartes V1 launched on the TRON MainNet, and all trades are held and processed by smart contracts. The main goal of the YFX team, which is formed by a group of engineers who have years of experience working on trading systems and blockchain, is to build a DEX that can compete with CEX on derivative trading.

The Wall Street Bets saga, an incredibly ridiculous story about a group of amateur Reddit investors who beat career Wall Street hedge funds at their own game, is to be made into a movie.

According to a report by online news site Deadline on Jan. 31, Metro Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) won the rights to produce the film in a bidding war involving major Hollywood movie houses.

The movie is to be based on a book proposed by author Ben Mezrich. Mezrich’s previous work, “The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding Of Facebook, a Tale Of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal,” was adapted into the motion picture “The Social Network.”

The title to his planned latest book offering is called “The Antisocial Network,” said the report, quoting sources familiar with the development. The book is expected to go out to publishers later this February, it said.

However, it is not yet clear what shape or structure the movie will take. MGM’s Michael DeLuca will produce the film. DeLuca also produced the Academy-Award winning The Social Network. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss will executive produce via their Winklevoss Pictures production company.

The Wall Street Bets group noticed that major hedge funds on Wall Street had been placing short bets against companies they considered to be dying. The funds particularly targeted Gamestop, the world’s largest video game retailer, continually shorting the company’s shares.

But the Redditors saw an opportunity to make profit and collectively bet the other way, buying shares and stock options. This resulted in the value of the Gamestop shares soaring by more than 2,600% in January.

Hedge funds that had shorted the stock incurred losses running into several billions of dollars. One fund, Melvin Capital, reportedly lost up to $7 billion to the “short squeeze” in January, forcing it to restructure its investment portfolio to ensure a faster escape in future “squeezes.”

The Reddit traders also extended the pump to a few other stocks considered to be dying, including AMC (which climbed over 900% in January), as well as Nokia and Blackberry. This surge of activity resulted in a major controversy when the trading app Robinhood began restricting trade on certain stocks.

Alongside the cryptocurrency’s meteoric climb over the back half of 2020 and early 2021, a curious phenomenon has unfolded; heightened profit-taking and conversion to fiat currencies. Data collected by Simplex, a fiat-crypto gateway, underscores this seemingly paradoxical development.

A Curious Race to Convert Crypto to Fiat Has Accompanied Bitcoin’s Latest Drive Higher

Sharing exclusive data with Bitcoin.com, Simplex cofounder and chief analytics officer Netanel Kabala says:

While the international press coverage of Bitcoin’s rally has caused a swathe of new users to flock to the industry and buy-in, outflows have been equally significant. Of the total amount of cryptocurrency sold in the last six months, 43% was off ramped in December alone.

A quick look at Google Trends for the term ‘Bitcoin’ echoes these developments, especially now that new equity instruments like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and big-name funds like Blackrock are adding exposure and raising crypto awareness.

Still, given the increased ability to quickly convert crypto and withdraw in fiat currencies, the uptick in funds leaving the ecosystem is astonishing. Part of this can be attributed to the growing fungibility of cryptocurrency, primarily helped by the support of players like Simplex, which empowers users to buy, sell, and spend crypto through Visa partnerships.

Although some of the latest rally’s onlookers have decried the rapid rise in crypto valuations as proof that a bubble is forming in this nascent asset class, others within the industry see the development as a harbinger of times to come. One of the areas this is most apparent is altcoins.

Data compiled by Simplex illustrates that as Bitcoin prices have leveled off above $30,000, daily purchases of altcoins have risen by approximately 65%. More interestingly, the data highlights that newer users account for nearly 20% of this volume, marking a sharp increase in the number of novice retail investors expanding and diversifying their exposure within the ecosystem.

Poloniex, one of the top 20 global cryptocurrency exchanges, which has adopted Simplex’s platform, has experienced these results firsthand. Karen McHenry, Poloniex’s Director of Product, attributes this development to greater access within the ecosystem, especially with Simplex’s buy option, which promotes instant account funding alongside the heightened ability to cash out quickly.

She also doesn’t see the ability to more quickly convert from crypto to fiat as harming interest despite the eyepopping amounts taken off exchanges.

It may sound surprising, but adding the ‘sell’ option actually has a positive impact on the number of crypto transactions too.

Though this easy offramp and soaring volume of sell orders might seem negative for prices, it can also be viewed as a healthy reflection of the ecosystem’s growing use cases. Besides making it easier to exit and enter, growing areas like decentralized finance (defi) and greater fungibility all contribute to a cryptocurrency’s value proposition.

As institutions begin lining up to add exposure as retail accumulation climbs, Bitcoin momentum may actually accelerate, and by extension, lift the altcoins sought after by the newcomers seeking opportunities outside the seminal crypto coin.

McHenry adds:

If the bull market can maintain its momentum, some of these BTC profits will flow into altcoins, which are particularly popular among retail investors. This creates a positive feedback loop, with traders who turn a profit prone to telling their friends about crypto, which brings more investment into the space.

This past week, another social media trend started on the Reddit forum r/wallstreetbets, which aims to initiate a large silver short squeeze in order to push the price of the precious metal to $1,000 per ounce. However, the silver squeeze trend comes with controversy, as numerous wallstreetbets supporters believe hedge funds like Melvin Capital and Citadel are behind the silver push.

The Controversial ‘Silver Squeeze’

During the last week, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the wallstreetbets (WSB) saga taking place on social media forums and the infamous subreddit r/wallstreetbets. Since the mega short squeeze on the Gamestop (GME) shares, the squeeze maneuver has also spilled into a number of other stocks. This week, shares from the Russell 3000 Index (RUA) were targeted including tickers like NOK, GOGO, AMCX, and FIZZ. But the trend didn’t stop there, as one post, in particular, had called for a “silver squeeze.” The WSB Reddit post called for the silver squeeze to push the price of silver from $25 per ounce to $1,000.

Now since the post was published, the Reddit admins in charge of moderating r/wallstreetbets removed the post. But that was long after the message was made viral by the participants discussing the pros and cons of attempting to squeeze silver. Now the reason people think the silver short squeeze post may be shady, is because a number of WSB Redditors believe the silver squeeze was invoked by the hedge funds losing money in order to cover their GME losses. There are a great number of Reddit posts warning that people should not participate in the silver short squeeze.

One post said:

Citadel is the 5th largest owner of [silver], it’s imperative we do not ‘squeeze’ it. These are hedge fund bots spamming awards.

The people who dislike the silver trend on WSB, have also warned that Melvin Capital Management is also a big silver holder. Unfortunately, it is hard to tell where the silver pump threads and posts are stemming from, as there are many free-market supporters who are fans of the precious metal sometimes referred to as the ‘poor man’s gold.’

Despite this, there are numbers of WSB fans and Redditors claiming the silver pump stemmed from hedge fund people and they believe there are imposters everywhere now. Some of these people are growing irrational, getting mad at anyone who posts about silver. Many WSB supporters might be feeling the pain from Gamestop Corp. shares dropping significantly on Monday.

Silver soars past $30 a troy ounce as Reddit-fuelled buying frenzy continues for 3rd day. #Silversqueeze pic.twitter.com/mLmasUBrq1 — Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) February 1, 2021

In Spite of Controversy, Something Is Sparking Silver Demand

Despite the speculation, some sort of demand was invoked when it comes to silver prices and obtaining physical bullion. For instance, if you are attempting to purchase an ounce or ounces of silver bullion online, the process is far more complicated now than it was last week. A large portion of bars and coins are either sold out or the prices are marked up considerably.

This is simple arbitrage. #Silver futures are 28.67. Silver Eagles on Apmex are $41.66, thats a 45% premium to futures. Obvious opportunity to buy futures & stand for delivery for a 35% discount on physical right? But when they don't have it, Futures = $41.66/oz. #silversqueeze — Jonathan #SILVERSQUEEZE Mergott (@Jmergz1985) February 1, 2021

All the American Eagles are sold out across a number of bullion dealers. On Sunday morning, a few big-name dealers have halted a great number of silver sales. News.Bitcoin.com’s most recent WSB report disclosed how SD Bullion sold nearly 10x the number of silver ounces than usual. People visiting bullion dealer websites like Provident, Apmex, and JD Bullion could see the unprecedented demand targeting physical silver.

“In the last week, we have seen a dramatic shift in Silver demand from our customers,” said Ken Lewis CEO of the bullion dealer Apmex. “For example, the ratio of ounces sold per day was running about two times earlier in the week and closer to four times the average demand by the end of the week,” Lewis added.

The Apmex CEO further stressed:

Once markets closed on Friday, we saw demand hit as much as six times a typical business day and more than 12 times a normal weekend day. Combined with the extremely high demand levels, we are also seeing a surge in new customers. On Saturday alone, we added as many new customers as we usually add in a week.

Additionally, the hashtag “#silversqueeze” has been trending throughout the United States and a few other countries on Twitter during the last 48 hours. By the late afternoon on Sunday, spot silver and futures traded at $27 per Troy ounce, and by Monday morning spot silver traded 7.7% higher at $29.76. The commodity hopped above the $30 region, and silver prices per ounce exchanged hands at $30.35 an ounce. One ounce of .999 silver is hovering in the $29 price handle at the time of publication

CHAPTER ONE: Listening to the Past

“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.” — Satoshi Nakamoto

The trusted third party problem has haunted modern financial systems and centralized exchanges because people require an intermediary to make them work. The third party’s good or bad motives become a defining aspect of the transaction, and the those who use the institutions are at the mercy of those intentions. This is especially true of the current system of state-issued money and central banking.

A trustless system avoids intermediaries and does not depend upon the intentions of participants; that is, the system functions in the same manner regardless of anyone’s intentions. The blockchain, with a transparent and immutable peer-to peer protocol, is called trustless because there is no corruptible intermediary upon whom exchanges must depend.

On a small scale, the trusted third party problem may always exist because a middleman is useful or necessary in some situations. If third parties offer competitive services on a free market, however, the damage of dishonesty or incompetence is limited. People can take their business elsewhere, report a swindler to watchdogs, warn others, and file a lawsuit.

An occasionally dishonest third party is not the problem Satoshi addresses. He speaks to the institutionalized corruption of government and central banks from which the average person could not escape by using a competitor or by suing. Almost everyone who works over the table, runs a business, buys or sells goods, accepts government benefits or pays taxes has had to accept a fiat that constantly plunges in value due to inflation. Almost everyone who uses credit, accepts checks, takes out loans, conducts commerce or does business abroad has needed to go through banks that steal like drunken muggers.

For average people, the situation used to seem hopeless because no legal, practical, and private alternative existed for transferring funds across considerable distance, including borders. Attempts to reform or remove the system also seemed doomed because it was inherently corrupt and self-serving. In fact, fiat and central banking were serving the purpose for which they had been established: financial control by elites. People’s need for money and exchange became their straitjackets.

Then Satoshi. Then the blockchain and crypto. A new concept of money was created in a form that cannot not be inflated; the number of bitcoins is fixed at 21 million divisible units. The supply can only decrease when coins are lost, as inevitably happens. Satoshi notes, “Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.” Bitcoin solved the fiat problem.

A new concept of financial transfer solved the third party problem, especially with regard to banks. Although peer-to-peer transactions involve a middleman or miner, no trust is required since the transaction is released only when “proof of work” is rendered, which consists of solving a complicated math problem. Arriving at a solution may be costly in computer power and time, but the solutions themselves are easy to verify. Satoshi comments, “With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.” The soundness and propriety of the blockchain’s protocol itself is assured by the use of open source that is visible to all and verifiable. The political outcome: A private currency and method of exchange freed people from financial oppression.

The idea of private currency itself is hardly new, however.

Precedent in Radical Individualist Theory

The late Friedrich Hayek is the most respected Austrian economist of the 20th century. His book The Denationalisation of Money: An Analysis of the Theory and Practice of Concurrent Currencies argues vigorously for private and competitive currencies to displace government-issued ones. Hayek ponders a key question. “When one studies the history of money one cannot help wondering why people should have put up for so long with governments exercising an exclusive power over two thousand years that was regularly used to exploit and defraud them. This can be explained only by the myth” that government money was necessary “becoming so firmly established that it did not occur even to the professional students of these matters…ever to question it. But once the validity of the established doctrine is doubted its foundation is rapidly seen to be fragile.”

Governments reap incredible profits from debasing the currency, but the rigged game works only if people have no alternative but to play it. The political purpose of legal tender and banking laws is to grant a monopoly to the state, which permits the redistribution of wealth and power from average people upward to the elite of society. Fiat money and banking remains fragile, however, because the system relies on people either not understanding the dynamics or not having a choice. Hayek wonders why public understanding is so elusive. Why was “a government monopoly of the provision of money…universally regarded as indispensable” and what would happen “if the provision of money were thrown open to the competition of private concerns supplying different currencies?”

With eerie prescience, Hayek argues for currencies developed by entrepreneurs who innovate new forms of money just as they innovate in other areas. One of the drawbacks of government’s monopoly is that it imposes a freeze on the sort of invention that now runs free in crypto. The voluntaryist historian Carl Watner observes, “No one can tell in advance what form these monies might take because no one can know for sure what choices individuals would make or what new technologies might be discovered. Laws forcing people to use the Federal Reserve System money have frozen monetary developments at a certain stage…Just imagine if Congress had protected the Post Office by passing laws that would have prevented people from communicating via the internet. We would never have experienced the marvels of e-mail.”

The late Austrian economist Murray Rothbard also wrestles with the question of “why do people so vigorously resist private currencies?” His book For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto advances an explanation. “If the government and only the government had had a monopoly of the shoe manufacturing and retailing business, how would most of the public treat the libertarian who now came along to advocate that the government get out of the shoe business and throw it open to private enterprise?” Rothbard predicts that the skeptics would attack the libertarian for depriving them of the only possible source of shoes—the government. People are thoroughly indoctrinated to believe that daily life cannot function without the state and fiat.

Hayek and Rothbard are unusual among free-market economists in their embrace of private money and monetary systems. Even laissez-faire zealots rarely champion free-market currencies or private banking. Instead, they debate marginal issues such as fractional reserve and other reforms they think will improve the existing system. Or they argue for the restoration of a gold standard as though it were a panacea. But if a gold standard were applied to fiat, the system would still require people to trust the government and banks. This means trusting both institutions to act against their own interests, which they have historically neglected to do.

The modern neglect of free-market money and banking is odd because 19th century radical individualists focused intensely on the importance of private money and private banking to personal freedom. They placed a primal emphasis on the right of every individual to create his own currency and to function as his own bank. It was a natural right as important as freedom of speech or of religion. The pivotal individualist Benjamin Tucker believed that the right to issue private currency was so important that it could destroy the State all by itself. His reasoning: The money monopoly, including control of credit, was how the State sustained itself and robbed average people not merely of wealth but also of economic opportunity.

Two specific events sculpted the approach that the early individualist-anarchists adopted toward the monetary monopoly. One was the Panic of 1837 that tipped the United States into recession until the mid-1840s. Commonly cited causes of the Panic include a collapsing land bubble and a sharp fall in cotton prices. Blame is also placed at the feet of President Andrew Jackson for vetoing the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States and precipitating an unfortunate chain of economic events. Drawing on the work of Professor of Economics Peter Temin, Rothbard disputes this interpretation.

First, he [Temin] points out that the price inflation really began earlier, when wholesale prices reached a trough of 82 in July 1830 and then rose by 20.7 percent in three years to reach 99 in the fall of 1833. The reason for the price rise is simple: The total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $159 million in 1833, an increase of 45.9 percent, or an annual rise of 15.3 percent. Breaking the figures down further, the total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $155 million a year and a half later, a spectacular expansion of 35 percent. Unquestionably, this monetary expansion was spurred by the still-flourishing Bank of the United States, which increased its notes and deposits from January 1830 to January 1832 from a total of $29 million to $42.1 million, a rise of 45.2 percent. Thus, the price and money inflation in the first few years of the 1830s were again sparked by the expansion of the still-dominant central bank.

Arguably, the Panic began in May 1837 when banks in New York City announced they would not redeem commercial paper for specie at full face value. Of the approximately 800 banks in America, all but six ceased at one point or another to redeem banknotes and deposits for gold or silver coins. Suspicion and hatred of traditional banks and government-issued money soared, with radicals scrutinizing alternate systems.

The other event dramatically to impact the radical fever from monetary reform was the Civil War for which the North financed its fighting through Legal Tender Acts and the National Banking Act of 1863.

The radicals did not merely theorize; they experimented with private currencies and new economic models. Their efforts are fascinating, but they are also cautionary tales. A major problem for 19th-century individualist-anarchism was the movement’s general acceptance of a link between sound money and the labor theory of value. This theory states that the true value of a good or service is based on the labor required to produce it rather than the price at which a seller and buyer are willing to exchange. In short, a good has intrinsic and not subjective value. (More on this in the section on the Regression Theorem.) Happily, their main economic goal was the abolition of the “money monopoly.” The term referred to three different but interacting forms of monopoly: banking, the charging of interest, and the privileged issuance of currency. The abolition of state power over currency was the focus, and they eschewed the use of force to implement their own schemes.

Josiah Warren provided a real-world example of what was meant by a currency that rested on the labor theory of value. Credited with being the first American anarchist, Warren tested his specific solution to the money monopoly through a Time Store from which he issued “Labor Notes.” In 1827, the business opened with $300 worth of groceries and dry goods that were offered at a 7 percent markup from Warren’s own costs in order to cover expenses such as overhead. This was before groceries were prepackaged or preweighed, and it was usual for buyers to bargain with the shopkeeper rather than pay a posted price. One of

Warren’s innovations was to post prices, which drove costs lower because transactions consumed less time. The customer paid in traditional money for the goods and paid with a Labor Note to compensate Warren for his time. The Labor Note obliged the customer to provide Warren with an equivalent amount of his time. If the buyer was a seamstress, for example, the Labor Note committed her to render to Warren X units of time to produce clothing. Warren’s goal was to establish an economy—or to establish a proof of principle, at least—in which profit was based on the exchange of time and labor. The Labor Notes were circulated and traded widely with in the community.

To some degree, Warren succeeded. People traveled from a hundred miles away to avail themselves of the Time Store’s low prices. After a few years, he declared the experiment to be a success and closed the store. Whether the Labor Notes were a success is questionable, however. The store itself may well have succeeded due to its low prices, not to the Notes. Whichever explanation is true, it is difficult to see how this novel currency could function in dense populations or on a grander scale of commerce. Few people today would be convinced of the viability of private money based on the Time Store experiment.

What could convince the public and economists that private currencies work as well or better than government-issued ones? Going back a bit further in American history is a good place to start because the future is always based on the past.

21Shares AG, a Zurich-based investment provider, is launching what is being dubbed as the world’s first Polkadot exchange-traded product, or ETP.

The DOT ETP will be listed on the Swiss exchange SIX on Thursday, February 4, said the company in a statement on Tuesday. DOT is the native token of the Polkadot network.

DOT has since been added to 21Shares’ Crypto Basket ETP (HODL), which tracks five major assets including bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH). Since its addition on Jan. 29, DOT now accounts for 27% of the product behind BTC at 50%.

Hany Rashwan, chief executive officer of 21Shares, said the firm has seen “unprecedented demand” from institutional investors wanting exposure to crypto-assets. He stated that demand for its range of crypto ETPs has soared 500% since the third quarter of 2020, but there has been “a recent surge in interest” for DOT.

“After investors purchase their first bitcoins through our ETPs, there is a natural transition to invest in other crypto assets,” Rashwan detailed.

“We benefit from trusted partners for the liquidity provision and upon continued institutional demand, we are launching the DOT ETP to give investors a safe, regulated, and easy way to obtain exposure to this exciting new blockchain technology,” he added.

Rashwan revealed that 21Shares, an issuer of exchange-traded products, is planning to add up to three ETPs over the next 3 months. He said European investors have been approaching the company to launch new products.

Created by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Polkadot is a cross-blockchain that enables transfers of any type of data or asset, not just tokens. It is also used as an electronic payment system.

DOT is now the world’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market capitalization of $16.55 billion, according to data from markets.Bitcoin.com. At the time of writing, DOT is trading at $17.22, up 8% over the past 24 hours.

Ukraine’s government-owned nuclear power plant picked a firm to build a massive data center in Rivne for cryptocurrency mining operations. After a bidding process, Energoatom chose Kyiv Energy Construction Company to handle the nuclear plant crypto mining project.

Nuclear Power Plant Operator Expects to Launch the Data Center in 2022

According to official documents, the data center will be based in the Rivne nuclear power plant, after the construction firm got 8.92 million Hryvnia ($317,620) in funding. The only competitor in the bidding was Ukrenergobudproek. However, they allegedly made an expensive offer, said the regional news outlet Forklog.

The Kyiv Energy Construction Company expects to finish the data center building by August 31, 2022. Per the announcement, the contractor is required to send the documentation that details the whole process. It includes “host state registers, electronic archives, and computing facilities.”

In terms of technical details, the nuclear power plant has a capacity of 2,657 megawatts, and it was built in the late 1970s. Also, the operations of the state-owned nuclear facilities started at the beginning of 1980.

In October 2020, Energoatom also signed a memorandum with a subsidiary of crypto mining giant Bitfury. With the new data center, local media outlets believe Bitfury miners could move their operations into the power plant’s facilities.

Ukraine’s Interest Towards Building Crypto Mining Data Centers in Nuclear Plants

The deal between Energoatom and Kyiv Energy Construction Company is not a surprising move. In fact, the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine asked Energoatom in May 2020 to conduct research to assess crypto mining’s feasibility at their nuclear plants.

As an anecdotal fact in terms of crypto mining in Ukrainian nuclear plants, the nation’s Security Service found illegal crypto mining equipment in a nuclear power plant in 2019.

The installation’s illegal mining rigs were found in the Southern region of Ukraine. Moreover, the investigations determined that such illegal equipment breached a “state secret.”

The Opulous’ defi lending mechanism, which is being developed on the Algorand public blockchain, leverages music copyrights’ tangibility through a smart contract setup that automatically handles principal and interest payments along with distributions to investors.

For musicians already receiving royalties, this presents a unique opportunity to monetize their assets or contribute to the pool to stake other artists. When seeking capital, artists can access funds by collateralizing loans from Opulous’ Music Copyright Pools with their music royalties.

Besides digitizing music as an asset class, the move will invite more democratized participation from artists and investors seeking to gain a foothold in the music industry, which is undergoing tremendous annual growth and expected to double in size by 2030. Artists benefit from interest rates starting as low as 4%, while investors in the copyright pools can add exposure to music royalties as an asset class for 10% returns per annum.

Per Ditto CEO Lee Parsons,

Opulous cuts out traditional banking, providing musicians with a platform with minimal interest payments, while giving investors the chance to stake a claim in one of the most exciting and fastest-growing financial industries in the world.

Ditto, which has already processed more than $1 billion in royalties for its 250,000-plus users, sees industry revenues doubling in the next ten years, building a compelling investment thesis. In keeping with Opulous’ mission to democratize musicians’ financial access, users outside the Ditto ecosystem are welcome to join the peer-to-peer lending framework.

Opulous has raised $1.5 million in funding to-date from BASIC, Borderless Capital, Kosmos Capital, Somesing, and TrustVerse. Roll out of the platform’s minimum viable product (MVP) is anticipated in two months as development proceeds.

Elastos, which built its decentralized application (dapp) platform and currency (ELA) to protect users’ digital assets and creations, will be among the first token staking partners for Opulous’ proof-of-stake consensus protocol. Opulous, in concert with Elastos, will allow investors to stake their Elastos (ELA) coins within the Music Copyright Pools.

According to Clarence Liu, the VP of Development at the Elastos Foundation,

Elastos and Ditto Music have been researching how blockchain can address fundamental inefficiencies in the music industry. Access to funding – which Opulous will address – is only the tip of the iceberg.

“Our collaboration has much more in the pipeline and our community is definitely set on using the forward momentum sparked by recent world events to introduce new users to the decentralized internet ideals set by Elastos,” Liu concludes.

During the last year, Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem has grown exponentially to form a multi Billion Dollar market. As Decentralized Finance expands, it becomes more and more relevant to have cross-chain connections that enable crypto assets to flow instantly and seamlessly across blockchain networks. These make it possible for DeFi platforms to be an effective alternative to centralized exchanges. Today, pNetwork launches the first EOS to Ethereum cross-chain connection to enable the EOS crypto asset to be moved into Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem.

EOS on Ethereum

EOS, the native token on the EOS blockchain, is a top20 cryptocurrency by market cap and the engine powering one of the most active dApps ecosystems. The asset counts over $ 3.5 Billion in daily trading volumes, figuring as the 9th most traded cryptocurrency. At present, only a fraction of the total is happening in a decentralized fashion.

While the DeFi ecosystem on EOS continues to grow, it has not yet reached Ethereum’s size. The latter powers Billions in daily trading volumes, Uniswap being the largestlarges liquidity protocol in existence and the fourth biggest DeFi protocol in terms of Total Value Locked.

Following the delivery of 26 bridges connecting six different blockchain protocols, including the cross-chain transfer of popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin, pNetwork launches today a new cross-chain connection that brings EOS to Ethereum.

As the first tokenised version of EOS, pEOS makes the asset compatible with Ethereum’s DeFi. This creates a benefit on both sides, enabling Ethereum’s DeFi protocols to expand their range of assets supported and granting EOS the option to be traded in a decentralized fashion as well as being supported as a collateral type by major Ethereum-based landing platforms.

Cross-chain connections are critical for a variety of use-cases, from NFTs to market making to decentralized indexes such as PieDAO’s Pies. pNetwork-powered asset tokenisation on Ethereum enables such indexes to represent the entire crypto market.

All pTokenised assets are pegged 1:1 to their underlying asset and are available for automated minting or redeeming on the pTokens dApp. In addition, pTokens are supported on a variety of DeFi protocols, decentralized exchanges and wallets on a growing number of blockchains.

Making Ethereum and EOS dApps Interoperable

Ethereum and EOS are two of the most active ecosystems for dApps, counting thousands of users each. By connecting these two blockchain environments, pNetwork aims to support the growth and development of decentralized applications such as lending/borrowing, trading, derivatives, and more. Acting as a cross-chain highway for cryptocurrencies to frictionlessly move from one blockchain to another, pNetwork powers the first bi-directional connection between the Ethereum and EOS blockchains.

Users on either blockchain are now able to interact with both ecosystems without ever leaving their blockchain of choice. Projects from both Ethereum and EOS communities have developed building blocks to create the next-generation financial system – with the connection between these two, users will find an even more powerful DeFi ecosystem.

By leveraging pNetwork’s cross-chain solution, dApps on the two blockchain platforms now have the opportunity to interoperate. Each ecosystem leveraging its counterpart’s strengths ultimately creates a benefit on both sides and sets the basis for sustainable growth. The presence of an EOS/ETH decentralized trading pair both with Ethereum’s and EOS’s decentralized finance, for example, makes it possible for market makers to arbitrage between the two blockchains. This results in a more liquid decentralized market for both assets.

As the so-called ‘meme coin’ is actively making the headlines within the crypto sphere, a publicly-traded company is joining the dogecoin frenzy. Kronos Advanced Technology announced they’ll start accepting dogecoin as one of its payment methods.

Kronos Also Accepts Other Cryptocurrencies Such as Bitcoin and Ether

According to the announcement, the Los Angeles-based firm is adding dogecoin (DOGE) to its accepted payment form. In fact, customers will be able to purchase air purifiers, and personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies via the meme coin.

Adopting dogecoin as a payment method was not as part as just of a crypto adoption-driven maneuver. The company praised the popularity of the token and its uniqueness within the industry.

Also, Kronos pointed out that dogecoins transactions’ speed is a positive note for the Shiba Inu inspired meme token. So far, the company accepts several cryptos as payment methods, such as bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), litecoin (LTC), among others.

Expanding N95 Mask Market Into the Dogecoin Community

Michael Rubinov, president of Kronos Advanced Technologies, commented on the company’s stance towards cryptocurrencies:

In the last ten years, much has been said about how cryptocurrency will revolutionize payments, services, businesses and will change the world the way we know it. Cryptocurrency has changed e-commerce: as more and more people now shop online. Cryptocurrency gives customers more reasons to utilize the convenience of online shopping, as it mitigates the risk of fraud for both vendors and shoppers.

By adopting dogecoin as a form of payment, Kronos also expect to market N95 masks to the entire meme coin community on Reddit, which has grown over 670,000 members. The company also praised the fact that Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk endorses dogecoin as one of his favorite cryptocurrencies.

Despite the recent frenzy seen in the meme coin, the latest markets.Bitcoin.com data shows that dogecoin is exchanging hands at $0.0317, down -20.43% on Tuesday. The market capitalization still stands at $4.08 billion.

Spacex and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been trying to get to the bottom of what happened with the popular trading app Robinhood when it stopped people from buying shares of hot stocks, like Gamestop. The shares of these stocks became popular due to the Wallstreetbets movement.

Elon Musk Says People Want the Truth From Robinhood

During an interview on The Good Time Show via the Clubhouse app Sunday night, Elon Musk grilled the CEO of trading app Robinhood, Vlad Tenev, over the company’s decision to restrict hot stocks last week, including Gamestop. On Friday, Robinhood also restricted crypto trading, citing “extraordinary market conditions.”

“What happened last week? Why can’t people buy the Gamestop shares? The people demand an answer and they want to know the details and the truth,” Musk said.

Tenev began by explaining the structure of his company. “Robinhood is actually a couple of companies,” he described. Robinhood Financial processes trades, Robinhood Securities clears and settles the trades, and Robinhood Crypto which deals with crypto trades.

The Robinhood CEO detailed that last Wednesday, his platform experienced “unprecedented volume” as “a lot of these so-called meme stocks were going viral on social media and people were joining Robinhood” to buy these stocks. Consequently, the company “received a file” from the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) Thursday morning at about 3:30 AM PST. It requested Robinhood to “put up money to the NSCC based on some factors,” including the volatility of certain securities. Tenev clarified that “this is the equities business so it’s based on stock trading and not options trading or anything else,” elaborating:

They gave us a file with a deposit and the request was around $3 billion dollars which is about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is.

Musk interrupted Tenev, questioning: “Why is that so high? It sounds like this is an unprecedented increase in demand for capital. What formula did they use to calculate that?”

Tenev replied: “We don’t have the full details. It’s a little bit of an opaque formula but there’s a component called the VAR of it, which is the Value at Risk, and that’s based on kind of some fairly quantitative things … and then there’s a special component which is discretionary so that kind of acts as a multiplier.” Tenev also noted that up until that point, his company “has raised a little bit around two billion dollars in total venture capital,” so the request was “a big number.”

The Tesla CEO interrupted again, asking: “What everyone wants to know is did something maybe shady go down here? It seems weird that you’d get a sudden $10 billion demand in the morning … suddenly out of nowhere.” Tenev swiftly corrected Musk that the number was $3 billion. The Robinhood CEO then emphasized:

I wouldn’t impugn shadiness to it or anything like that, and actually the NSCC was reasonable subsequent to this. They worked with us to actually lower it. It was unprecedented activity.

Musk abruptly asked Tenev: “Is there anyone holding you hostage right now?” Tenev chuckled and replied: “No, no, I’m okay. Thanks for asking.” Both laughed.

The Robinhood CEO proceeded to explain what happened, calling the experience “nerve-wrecking.” He said after receiving the request for $3 billion, his chief operating officer called up someone higher up at the NSCC to discuss what to do. “There was another call and they lowered it to something like $1.4 billion from $3 billion,” Tenev reiterated that it was still a high number. His company then proposed a plan to the NSCC of “marking these volatile stocks that were kind of driving the activity position-closing only.”

Then, at about 5 to 5:30 AM PST, before the market opened, the NSCC came back and reduced the deposit requirement to $700 million, “which we then deposited and paid promptly,” Tenev emphasized. Acknowledging that the move was bad for customers, the Robinhood CEO said, “We had no choice, in this case. We had to conform to our regulatory capital requirements and so the team did what they could to make sure we were available for customers.”

The Spacex CEO further questioned: “Who controls this organization, this clearinghouse?” Tenev replied: “It’s a consortium. It’s not quite a government agency. I don’t really know the details of all of that.” Nonetheless, he emphasized that “To be fair … I think there was legitimate sort of turmoil in the markets … so there probably is some amount of extra risk in the system that warrants higher requirements so it’s not entirely unreasonable.” He noted that lots of other brokers were in the same situation and had to restrict the same activity.

“So it sounds like this organization calls you up and they basically have a gun to your head: either hand over this money or else,” the Spacex CEO summarized, elaborating:

Basically, what people are wondering is did you sell your clients down the river or did you have no choice. If you had no choice, that’s understandable but then we got to find out why you had no choice and who are these people that are saying you have no choice.

“I think that’s fair. We have to comply with these requirements. Financial institutions have requirements,” Tenev responded. Nonetheless, he suggested that it would be helpful to know the formula the NSCC uses to calculate these requirements so companies can plan better.

Musk proceeded to ask about whether there was outside pressure forcing Robinhood to take the action it did. Tenev affirmed that there is “a rumor that Citadel or other market makers kind of pressured us into doing this.” However, he clarified, “that’s just false,” emphasizing that “this was a clearinghouse decision and it was just based on the capital requirements so from our perspective Citadel and other market makers weren’t involved in that.”

During the same Clubhouse interview, Elon also revealed that he is a supporter of bitcoin and should have bought the cryptocurrency eight years ago. He believes that bitcoin is on the verge of getting broad acceptance by traditional finance people. On Monday, Robinhood raised another $2.4 billion from shareholders after it secured $1 billion last Thursday.

PRESS RELEASE. The AdGram service was founded a year ago and is currently the largest advertising exchange in Telegram.

AdGram helps brands place large advertising volumes in channels and groups quickly and efficiently. Channels and groups benefit from expansion of their audience, it is easy to find advertisers and increase the earnings from advertising placements via AdGram.

Over the last 12 months, the service has gained a huge experience in communications with both advertisers and administrators from different countries, which has highlighted issues with settlements in multiple currencies. After overcoming these obstacles, it was decided that cryptocurrency could be the key to solving this problem.

With the termination of the Telegram team’s work on the TON project in May 2020 (the messenger lost one of its monetization methods), Free TON was launched which took over the development and popularization of TON Crystal using the open source code from the original TON. The uniqueness of FreeTON is that it is one of the few projects where all the tokens belong to the community and it is developing as a decentralized autonomous organization.

The potential of the underlying technology and the growth of the community inspired AdGram and in October 2020 they partnered with the FreeTON Community and fully integrated Crystal as a means of payment. Synergy with FreeTON made it possible to take a big step towards using cryptocurrencies as a single, simple and clear means of payment.

The ability to pay with tokens for advertising in Telegram creates a powerful use case for the TON Crystal token. Huge and constantly growing volume of the advertising market is vital for tokenomics as it creates supply and demand for market participants, thereby increasing the liquidity of the token itself.

For administrators and advertisers transactions in TON Crystal is simple, convenient and fast! It also solves the problem of collecting details for transfers in various currencies, and avoids paying banking fees.

Advertising on Telegram and the FreeTON blockchain, which is the successor of Durov’s original (but never happened Durov’s TON), create a strong and impact-resistant synergy of mutual benefits. This shows markets and communities can develop in a self-regulated environment.

PRESS RELEASE. CEX.IO LOAN experiences massive institutional demand for its crypto-backed lending service, with 41% of customers requesting to borrow cash against Bitcoin, 53% against Ethereum, and 6% against DeFi tokens.

Crypto-backed lending service CEX.IO LOAN that launched in October 2020 in select global jurisdictions, has been experiencing major demand, receiving over $100 million worth of loan requests to date. While the service has been widely popular among retail investors, most of the platform’s loan requests came from institutional investors.

According to CEX.IO LOAN, such an increase in demand can be attributed to the institutionalization of the cryptocurrency industry. Institutional investors, who have cryptocurrencies in their possession, regard it as a potential collateral for borrowing funds and actively utilise it as such. The borrowed funds are then used for further investment purposes.

In addition to featuring cutting-edge security and advanced anti-fraud measures, CEX.IO Group operates a regulated service, which has been licensed as a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) provider by the Gibraltar Financial Service Commission (GFSC) since last year. In addition to this, the Government of Gibraltar recently granted CEX.IO Limited a Money Lender License, allowing the firm to extend its ecosystem of regulated services with CEX.IO LOAN.

Institutional clients also prefer the company’s digital asset-backed lending service due to the convenience offered to users. On the CEX.IO LOAN platform, customers can borrow cash against their cryptocurrency assets in a quick and simple manner, without having to deal with credit checks or any unnecessary paperwork. To access the company’s instant crypto-backed lending service, new users have to open an account at the digital asset exchange and pass the mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML checks.

CEX.IO LOAN serves various cryptocurrency market participants, from retail investors, traders, and HODLers to startups, entrepreneurs, and large enterprises. As part of a flexible crypto-backed lending service, users can borrow any amount between $500 and $100,000 at competitive interest rates starting at 8.75% per year. Loan duration ranging from seven days to one year.

Currently, retail users can borrow funds against their Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) assets. Based on the company’s data, the feature has already experienced high demand from VIP clients, with 41% of all CEX.IO LOAN customers borrowing cash against Bitcoin (BTC), 53% against Ethereum (ETH), and 6% against DeFi tokens.

The company has recently introduced a VIP-exclusive feature to offer flexible lending conditions and the ability to use decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens as collateral for institutional clients on the crypto-backed lending platform.

Furthermore, to best serve institutional customers, the requests and queries of VIP clients are handled individually by dedicated personal managers on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Interestingly, 14% of CEX.IO VIP customers have already asked their personal managers about borrowing funds via the crypto-backed lending service.

“As institutional investors find the digital asset industry increasingly attractive, it’s a pleasure to serve them with our enterprise-grade instant crypto-backed loan platform. Security, convenience, and compliance are key priorities for corporate clients, which are features that we have been providing to all our clients in the rapidly growing CEX.IO ecosystem. Most importantly, we want to provide institutional clients with the best service. For that reason, VIP clients enjoy exclusive benefits, such as dedicated personal managers and flexible lending options, on the CEX.IO LOAN platform,” Anton Chashchin, Commercial Director for the CEX.IO LOAN service, stated.

In the announcement, the firm revealed further details about the size of the funds clients borrow on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Based on the company’s data, while retail investors borrow $1,400 on average, VIP clients request larger-sized loans that vary in size, with the typical amount being $1 million or higher.

Institutional clients do not just borrow more but also need the funds for more extended periods which usually range between 6 and 12 months. According to the company, this phenomenon indicates a long-term strategy for VIP clients to manage their assets.

PRESS RELEASE. PARSIQ, a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform connecting on-chain and off-chain applications in real-time, announced that its PRQ token is now listed on OKEx with USDT base pair.

Please take note of the following go-live schedule:

PRQ Deposit : 07:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Spot Trading : PRQ / USDT : 10:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Withdrawal : 10:00 January 29, 2021 (UTC)

PARSIQ is a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform that serves as a multi-level bridge between blockchains and off-chain applications. PARSIQ’s features automate the blockchain analytics and monitoring process, providing customizable workflows with real-time intelligence.

Developers and individual users can transform the blockchain data to their favorite off-chain application or web service.

Among the obvious use cases is monitoring the wallets of traders and ordinary users. Among the non-obvious are complex system integrations for financial institutions and DeFi projects that use the PARSIQ infrastructure to improve security, conduct audits, comply with regulatory requirements, AML, and expand their workflows in other ways.

The infrastructure underneath PARSIQ’s user interface is built with their proprietary programming language ParsiQL, and its users’ benefits are multiplying with each supported integration.

PRQ Token

PARSIQ Token (PRQ) is an essential piece of the PARSIQ platform that co-exists with FIAT payments for using its services. Payments within the platform that are made in PRQ tokens guarantee a discounted rate. During the first Epoch when PRQ tokens are used as payment for running Smart-Triggers users receive higher execution limits, unlock transport methods, and are able to propose features that can be added to the platform.

In October 2020, the PARSIQ team released plans for Epoch 2.0.

#1. Public Projects

With Public Projects users can subscribe to existing PARSIQ Projects that were pre-made by other users. By paying in PRQ, users that have subscribed to the Public Project will incentivize the creators to create interesting, complex, and more important – problem-solving projects.

#2. User Data and PRQ

Every single monitoring target (primitive of type address, a struct with the field of address type, table row) would require 1 PRQ to hold after the implementation. It means that if there are 1000 addresses (960 in the table as rows, 30 as primitives, 10 in the structs) then the User would need 1000 PRQ on the connected Ethereum Account balance.

#3. IQ Protocol

IQ Protocol will allow risk-free PRQ lending and collateral-less borrowing. Risk-free PRQ lending means that PRQ is not transferred from the lender’s address to the borrower’s address. Details on the algorithm are available in the dedicated explainer on PARSIQ’s blog.

#4. PRQBoost

PRQ Boost is a liquidity boost program to incentivize PRQ/ETH liquidity providers on Uniswap, which goes with the PRQBOOST utility tokens to increase rewards for liquidity providers.

PARSIQ is actively working to partner with major layer 1 blockchain protocols to expand the range of blockchain integrations and give projects that build on those protocols the ability to monitor and automate workflows between blockchain and off-chain.

PRESS RELEASE. YFX, the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts has just launched, adding an important piece to the DeFi money legos, and creating a direct competition against CEX on derivatives trading.

The most traded Bitcoin product in centralized exchanges is Bitcoin futures, which is 10 times bigger than spot trading in terms of the trading volume. But in DEX, spot trading platforms like Uniswap are occupying a large portion of the total trading volume, and there is not a single decentralized futures trading platform that could reach even 1/10 of Uniswap’s trading volume. What stops decentralized futures trading platforms from becoming 10 times bigger than Uniswap? Why are decentralized futures trading platforms performing worse than their centralized counterparts?

The main reason is that decentralized futures exchanges don’t currently provide an attractive futures product to compete with centralized futures exchanges. For instance, centralized futures exchanges like BitMex can provide 100x leverage on Bitcoin futures trading. On the other hand, decentralized futures exchanges like dYdX only offer 10x leverage. None of the decentralized exchanges can keep up with the 100x leverage offering from centralized exchanges.

YFX Descartes V1 uses QIC-AMM and a system de-risk mechanism to migrate perpetual futures trading from CEX to DEX without reducing the trading leverage, which makes YFX the first DEX that could offer 100x leverage on a perpetual contract. You can do everything on YFX that you can do on BitMex or OKEx. YFX is poised to compete directly against established centralized exchanges. YFX Descartes V1 runs on the TRON MainNet, for faster transaction times and cheaper gas fees compared to Ethereum. The YFX team is also working on Ethereum’s Layer 2 solution to provide pragmatic perpetual trading on DEX. YFX team plans to launch their DEX on Huobi Heco and Ethereum Test net in Q1, 2021.

About YFX

YFX is the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts. YFX Descartes V1 launched on the TRON MainNet, and all trades are held and processed by smart contracts. The main goal of the YFX team, which is formed by a group of engineers who have years of experience working on trading systems and blockchain, is to build a DEX that can compete with CEX on derivative trading.

The Wall Street Bets saga, an incredibly ridiculous story about a group of amateur Reddit investors who beat career Wall Street hedge funds at their own game, is to be made into a movie.

According to a report by online news site Deadline on Jan. 31, Metro Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) won the rights to produce the film in a bidding war involving major Hollywood movie houses.

The movie is to be based on a book proposed by author Ben Mezrich. Mezrich’s previous work, “The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding Of Facebook, a Tale Of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal,” was adapted into the motion picture “The Social Network.”

The title to his planned latest book offering is called “The Antisocial Network,” said the report, quoting sources familiar with the development. The book is expected to go out to publishers later this February, it said.

However, it is not yet clear what shape or structure the movie will take. MGM’s Michael DeLuca will produce the film. DeLuca also produced the Academy-Award winning The Social Network. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss will executive produce via their Winklevoss Pictures production company.

The Wall Street Bets group noticed that major hedge funds on Wall Street had been placing short bets against companies they considered to be dying. The funds particularly targeted Gamestop, the world’s largest video game retailer, continually shorting the company’s shares.

But the Redditors saw an opportunity to make profit and collectively bet the other way, buying shares and stock options. This resulted in the value of the Gamestop shares soaring by more than 2,600% in January.

Hedge funds that had shorted the stock incurred losses running into several billions of dollars. One fund, Melvin Capital, reportedly lost up to $7 billion to the “short squeeze” in January, forcing it to restructure its investment portfolio to ensure a faster escape in future “squeezes.”

The Reddit traders also extended the pump to a few other stocks considered to be dying, including AMC (which climbed over 900% in January), as well as Nokia and Blackberry. This surge of activity resulted in a major controversy when the trading app Robinhood began restricting trade on certain stocks.

Alongside the cryptocurrency’s meteoric climb over the back half of 2020 and early 2021, a curious phenomenon has unfolded; heightened profit-taking and conversion to fiat currencies. Data collected by Simplex, a fiat-crypto gateway, underscores this seemingly paradoxical development.

A Curious Race to Convert Crypto to Fiat Has Accompanied Bitcoin’s Latest Drive Higher

Sharing exclusive data with Bitcoin.com, Simplex cofounder and chief analytics officer Netanel Kabala says:

While the international press coverage of Bitcoin’s rally has caused a swathe of new users to flock to the industry and buy-in, outflows have been equally significant. Of the total amount of cryptocurrency sold in the last six months, 43% was off ramped in December alone.

A quick look at Google Trends for the term ‘Bitcoin’ echoes these developments, especially now that new equity instruments like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and big-name funds like Blackrock are adding exposure and raising crypto awareness.

Still, given the increased ability to quickly convert crypto and withdraw in fiat currencies, the uptick in funds leaving the ecosystem is astonishing. Part of this can be attributed to the growing fungibility of cryptocurrency, primarily helped by the support of players like Simplex, which empowers users to buy, sell, and spend crypto through Visa partnerships.

Although some of the latest rally’s onlookers have decried the rapid rise in crypto valuations as proof that a bubble is forming in this nascent asset class, others within the industry see the development as a harbinger of times to come. One of the areas this is most apparent is altcoins.

Data compiled by Simplex illustrates that as Bitcoin prices have leveled off above $30,000, daily purchases of altcoins have risen by approximately 65%. More interestingly, the data highlights that newer users account for nearly 20% of this volume, marking a sharp increase in the number of novice retail investors expanding and diversifying their exposure within the ecosystem.

Poloniex, one of the top 20 global cryptocurrency exchanges, which has adopted Simplex’s platform, has experienced these results firsthand. Karen McHenry, Poloniex’s Director of Product, attributes this development to greater access within the ecosystem, especially with Simplex’s buy option, which promotes instant account funding alongside the heightened ability to cash out quickly.

She also doesn’t see the ability to more quickly convert from crypto to fiat as harming interest despite the eyepopping amounts taken off exchanges.

It may sound surprising, but adding the ‘sell’ option actually has a positive impact on the number of crypto transactions too.

Though this easy offramp and soaring volume of sell orders might seem negative for prices, it can also be viewed as a healthy reflection of the ecosystem’s growing use cases. Besides making it easier to exit and enter, growing areas like decentralized finance (defi) and greater fungibility all contribute to a cryptocurrency’s value proposition.

As institutions begin lining up to add exposure as retail accumulation climbs, Bitcoin momentum may actually accelerate, and by extension, lift the altcoins sought after by the newcomers seeking opportunities outside the seminal crypto coin.

McHenry adds:

If the bull market can maintain its momentum, some of these BTC profits will flow into altcoins, which are particularly popular among retail investors. This creates a positive feedback loop, with traders who turn a profit prone to telling their friends about crypto, which brings more investment into the space.

This past week, another social media trend started on the Reddit forum r/wallstreetbets, which aims to initiate a large silver short squeeze in order to push the price of the precious metal to $1,000 per ounce. However, the silver squeeze trend comes with controversy, as numerous wallstreetbets supporters believe hedge funds like Melvin Capital and Citadel are behind the silver push.

The Controversial ‘Silver Squeeze’

During the last week, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the wallstreetbets (WSB) saga taking place on social media forums and the infamous subreddit r/wallstreetbets. Since the mega short squeeze on the Gamestop (GME) shares, the squeeze maneuver has also spilled into a number of other stocks. This week, shares from the Russell 3000 Index (RUA) were targeted including tickers like NOK, GOGO, AMCX, and FIZZ. But the trend didn’t stop there, as one post, in particular, had called for a “silver squeeze.” The WSB Reddit post called for the silver squeeze to push the price of silver from $25 per ounce to $1,000.

Now since the post was published, the Reddit admins in charge of moderating r/wallstreetbets removed the post. But that was long after the message was made viral by the participants discussing the pros and cons of attempting to squeeze silver. Now the reason people think the silver short squeeze post may be shady, is because a number of WSB Redditors believe the silver squeeze was invoked by the hedge funds losing money in order to cover their GME losses. There are a great number of Reddit posts warning that people should not participate in the silver short squeeze.

One post said:

Citadel is the 5th largest owner of [silver], it’s imperative we do not ‘squeeze’ it. These are hedge fund bots spamming awards.

The people who dislike the silver trend on WSB, have also warned that Melvin Capital Management is also a big silver holder. Unfortunately, it is hard to tell where the silver pump threads and posts are stemming from, as there are many free-market supporters who are fans of the precious metal sometimes referred to as the ‘poor man’s gold.’

Despite this, there are numbers of WSB fans and Redditors claiming the silver pump stemmed from hedge fund people and they believe there are imposters everywhere now. Some of these people are growing irrational, getting mad at anyone who posts about silver. Many WSB supporters might be feeling the pain from Gamestop Corp. shares dropping significantly on Monday.

Silver soars past $30 a troy ounce as Reddit-fuelled buying frenzy continues for 3rd day. #Silversqueeze pic.twitter.com/mLmasUBrq1 — Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) February 1, 2021

In Spite of Controversy, Something Is Sparking Silver Demand

Despite the speculation, some sort of demand was invoked when it comes to silver prices and obtaining physical bullion. For instance, if you are attempting to purchase an ounce or ounces of silver bullion online, the process is far more complicated now than it was last week. A large portion of bars and coins are either sold out or the prices are marked up considerably.

This is simple arbitrage. #Silver futures are 28.67. Silver Eagles on Apmex are $41.66, thats a 45% premium to futures. Obvious opportunity to buy futures & stand for delivery for a 35% discount on physical right? But when they don't have it, Futures = $41.66/oz. #silversqueeze — Jonathan #SILVERSQUEEZE Mergott (@Jmergz1985) February 1, 2021

All the American Eagles are sold out across a number of bullion dealers. On Sunday morning, a few big-name dealers have halted a great number of silver sales. News.Bitcoin.com’s most recent WSB report disclosed how SD Bullion sold nearly 10x the number of silver ounces than usual. People visiting bullion dealer websites like Provident, Apmex, and JD Bullion could see the unprecedented demand targeting physical silver.

“In the last week, we have seen a dramatic shift in Silver demand from our customers,” said Ken Lewis CEO of the bullion dealer Apmex. “For example, the ratio of ounces sold per day was running about two times earlier in the week and closer to four times the average demand by the end of the week,” Lewis added.

The Apmex CEO further stressed:

Once markets closed on Friday, we saw demand hit as much as six times a typical business day and more than 12 times a normal weekend day. Combined with the extremely high demand levels, we are also seeing a surge in new customers. On Saturday alone, we added as many new customers as we usually add in a week.

Additionally, the hashtag “#silversqueeze” has been trending throughout the United States and a few other countries on Twitter during the last 48 hours. By the late afternoon on Sunday, spot silver and futures traded at $27 per Troy ounce, and by Monday morning spot silver traded 7.7% higher at $29.76. The commodity hopped above the $30 region, and silver prices per ounce exchanged hands at $30.35 an ounce. One ounce of .999 silver is hovering in the $29 price handle at the time of publication

CHAPTER ONE: Listening to the Past

“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.” — Satoshi Nakamoto

The trusted third party problem has haunted modern financial systems and centralized exchanges because people require an intermediary to make them work. The third party’s good or bad motives become a defining aspect of the transaction, and the those who use the institutions are at the mercy of those intentions. This is especially true of the current system of state-issued money and central banking.

A trustless system avoids intermediaries and does not depend upon the intentions of participants; that is, the system functions in the same manner regardless of anyone’s intentions. The blockchain, with a transparent and immutable peer-to peer protocol, is called trustless because there is no corruptible intermediary upon whom exchanges must depend.

On a small scale, the trusted third party problem may always exist because a middleman is useful or necessary in some situations. If third parties offer competitive services on a free market, however, the damage of dishonesty or incompetence is limited. People can take their business elsewhere, report a swindler to watchdogs, warn others, and file a lawsuit.

An occasionally dishonest third party is not the problem Satoshi addresses. He speaks to the institutionalized corruption of government and central banks from which the average person could not escape by using a competitor or by suing. Almost everyone who works over the table, runs a business, buys or sells goods, accepts government benefits or pays taxes has had to accept a fiat that constantly plunges in value due to inflation. Almost everyone who uses credit, accepts checks, takes out loans, conducts commerce or does business abroad has needed to go through banks that steal like drunken muggers.

For average people, the situation used to seem hopeless because no legal, practical, and private alternative existed for transferring funds across considerable distance, including borders. Attempts to reform or remove the system also seemed doomed because it was inherently corrupt and self-serving. In fact, fiat and central banking were serving the purpose for which they had been established: financial control by elites. People’s need for money and exchange became their straitjackets.

Then Satoshi. Then the blockchain and crypto. A new concept of money was created in a form that cannot not be inflated; the number of bitcoins is fixed at 21 million divisible units. The supply can only decrease when coins are lost, as inevitably happens. Satoshi notes, “Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.” Bitcoin solved the fiat problem.

A new concept of financial transfer solved the third party problem, especially with regard to banks. Although peer-to-peer transactions involve a middleman or miner, no trust is required since the transaction is released only when “proof of work” is rendered, which consists of solving a complicated math problem. Arriving at a solution may be costly in computer power and time, but the solutions themselves are easy to verify. Satoshi comments, “With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.” The soundness and propriety of the blockchain’s protocol itself is assured by the use of open source that is visible to all and verifiable. The political outcome: A private currency and method of exchange freed people from financial oppression.

The idea of private currency itself is hardly new, however.

Precedent in Radical Individualist Theory

The late Friedrich Hayek is the most respected Austrian economist of the 20th century. His book The Denationalisation of Money: An Analysis of the Theory and Practice of Concurrent Currencies argues vigorously for private and competitive currencies to displace government-issued ones. Hayek ponders a key question. “When one studies the history of money one cannot help wondering why people should have put up for so long with governments exercising an exclusive power over two thousand years that was regularly used to exploit and defraud them. This can be explained only by the myth” that government money was necessary “becoming so firmly established that it did not occur even to the professional students of these matters…ever to question it. But once the validity of the established doctrine is doubted its foundation is rapidly seen to be fragile.”

Governments reap incredible profits from debasing the currency, but the rigged game works only if people have no alternative but to play it. The political purpose of legal tender and banking laws is to grant a monopoly to the state, which permits the redistribution of wealth and power from average people upward to the elite of society. Fiat money and banking remains fragile, however, because the system relies on people either not understanding the dynamics or not having a choice. Hayek wonders why public understanding is so elusive. Why was “a government monopoly of the provision of money…universally regarded as indispensable” and what would happen “if the provision of money were thrown open to the competition of private concerns supplying different currencies?”

With eerie prescience, Hayek argues for currencies developed by entrepreneurs who innovate new forms of money just as they innovate in other areas. One of the drawbacks of government’s monopoly is that it imposes a freeze on the sort of invention that now runs free in crypto. The voluntaryist historian Carl Watner observes, “No one can tell in advance what form these monies might take because no one can know for sure what choices individuals would make or what new technologies might be discovered. Laws forcing people to use the Federal Reserve System money have frozen monetary developments at a certain stage…Just imagine if Congress had protected the Post Office by passing laws that would have prevented people from communicating via the internet. We would never have experienced the marvels of e-mail.”

The late Austrian economist Murray Rothbard also wrestles with the question of “why do people so vigorously resist private currencies?” His book For a New Liberty: The Libertarian Manifesto advances an explanation. “If the government and only the government had had a monopoly of the shoe manufacturing and retailing business, how would most of the public treat the libertarian who now came along to advocate that the government get out of the shoe business and throw it open to private enterprise?” Rothbard predicts that the skeptics would attack the libertarian for depriving them of the only possible source of shoes—the government. People are thoroughly indoctrinated to believe that daily life cannot function without the state and fiat.

Hayek and Rothbard are unusual among free-market economists in their embrace of private money and monetary systems. Even laissez-faire zealots rarely champion free-market currencies or private banking. Instead, they debate marginal issues such as fractional reserve and other reforms they think will improve the existing system. Or they argue for the restoration of a gold standard as though it were a panacea. But if a gold standard were applied to fiat, the system would still require people to trust the government and banks. This means trusting both institutions to act against their own interests, which they have historically neglected to do.

The modern neglect of free-market money and banking is odd because 19th century radical individualists focused intensely on the importance of private money and private banking to personal freedom. They placed a primal emphasis on the right of every individual to create his own currency and to function as his own bank. It was a natural right as important as freedom of speech or of religion. The pivotal individualist Benjamin Tucker believed that the right to issue private currency was so important that it could destroy the State all by itself. His reasoning: The money monopoly, including control of credit, was how the State sustained itself and robbed average people not merely of wealth but also of economic opportunity.

Two specific events sculpted the approach that the early individualist-anarchists adopted toward the monetary monopoly. One was the Panic of 1837 that tipped the United States into recession until the mid-1840s. Commonly cited causes of the Panic include a collapsing land bubble and a sharp fall in cotton prices. Blame is also placed at the feet of President Andrew Jackson for vetoing the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States and precipitating an unfortunate chain of economic events. Drawing on the work of Professor of Economics Peter Temin, Rothbard disputes this interpretation.

First, he [Temin] points out that the price inflation really began earlier, when wholesale prices reached a trough of 82 in July 1830 and then rose by 20.7 percent in three years to reach 99 in the fall of 1833. The reason for the price rise is simple: The total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $159 million in 1833, an increase of 45.9 percent, or an annual rise of 15.3 percent. Breaking the figures down further, the total money supply had risen from $109 million in 1830 to $155 million a year and a half later, a spectacular expansion of 35 percent. Unquestionably, this monetary expansion was spurred by the still-flourishing Bank of the United States, which increased its notes and deposits from January 1830 to January 1832 from a total of $29 million to $42.1 million, a rise of 45.2 percent. Thus, the price and money inflation in the first few years of the 1830s were again sparked by the expansion of the still-dominant central bank.

Arguably, the Panic began in May 1837 when banks in New York City announced they would not redeem commercial paper for specie at full face value. Of the approximately 800 banks in America, all but six ceased at one point or another to redeem banknotes and deposits for gold or silver coins. Suspicion and hatred of traditional banks and government-issued money soared, with radicals scrutinizing alternate systems.

The other event dramatically to impact the radical fever from monetary reform was the Civil War for which the North financed its fighting through Legal Tender Acts and the National Banking Act of 1863.

The radicals did not merely theorize; they experimented with private currencies and new economic models. Their efforts are fascinating, but they are also cautionary tales. A major problem for 19th-century individualist-anarchism was the movement’s general acceptance of a link between sound money and the labor theory of value. This theory states that the true value of a good or service is based on the labor required to produce it rather than the price at which a seller and buyer are willing to exchange. In short, a good has intrinsic and not subjective value. (More on this in the section on the Regression Theorem.) Happily, their main economic goal was the abolition of the “money monopoly.” The term referred to three different but interacting forms of monopoly: banking, the charging of interest, and the privileged issuance of currency. The abolition of state power over currency was the focus, and they eschewed the use of force to implement their own schemes.

Josiah Warren provided a real-world example of what was meant by a currency that rested on the labor theory of value. Credited with being the first American anarchist, Warren tested his specific solution to the money monopoly through a Time Store from which he issued “Labor Notes.” In 1827, the business opened with $300 worth of groceries and dry goods that were offered at a 7 percent markup from Warren’s own costs in order to cover expenses such as overhead. This was before groceries were prepackaged or preweighed, and it was usual for buyers to bargain with the shopkeeper rather than pay a posted price. One of

Warren’s innovations was to post prices, which drove costs lower because transactions consumed less time. The customer paid in traditional money for the goods and paid with a Labor Note to compensate Warren for his time. The Labor Note obliged the customer to provide Warren with an equivalent amount of his time. If the buyer was a seamstress, for example, the Labor Note committed her to render to Warren X units of time to produce clothing. Warren’s goal was to establish an economy—or to establish a proof of principle, at least—in which profit was based on the exchange of time and labor. The Labor Notes were circulated and traded widely with in the community.

To some degree, Warren succeeded. People traveled from a hundred miles away to avail themselves of the Time Store’s low prices. After a few years, he declared the experiment to be a success and closed the store. Whether the Labor Notes were a success is questionable, however. The store itself may well have succeeded due to its low prices, not to the Notes. Whichever explanation is true, it is difficult to see how this novel currency could function in dense populations or on a grander scale of commerce. Few people today would be convinced of the viability of private money based on the Time Store experiment.

What could convince the public and economists that private currencies work as well or better than government-issued ones? Going back a bit further in American history is a good place to start because the future is always based on the past.

21Shares AG, a Zurich-based investment provider, is launching what is being dubbed as the world’s first Polkadot exchange-traded product, or ETP.

The DOT ETP will be listed on the Swiss exchange SIX on Thursday, February 4, said the company in a statement on Tuesday. DOT is the native token of the Polkadot network.

DOT has since been added to 21Shares’ Crypto Basket ETP (HODL), which tracks five major assets including bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH). Since its addition on Jan. 29, DOT now accounts for 27% of the product behind BTC at 50%.

Hany Rashwan, chief executive officer of 21Shares, said the firm has seen “unprecedented demand” from institutional investors wanting exposure to crypto-assets. He stated that demand for its range of crypto ETPs has soared 500% since the third quarter of 2020, but there has been “a recent surge in interest” for DOT.

“After investors purchase their first bitcoins through our ETPs, there is a natural transition to invest in other crypto assets,” Rashwan detailed.

“We benefit from trusted partners for the liquidity provision and upon continued institutional demand, we are launching the DOT ETP to give investors a safe, regulated, and easy way to obtain exposure to this exciting new blockchain technology,” he added.

Rashwan revealed that 21Shares, an issuer of exchange-traded products, is planning to add up to three ETPs over the next 3 months. He said European investors have been approaching the company to launch new products.

Created by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Polkadot is a cross-blockchain that enables transfers of any type of data or asset, not just tokens. It is also used as an electronic payment system.

DOT is now the world’s fifth-largest cryptocurrency, boasting a market capitalization of $16.55 billion, according to data from markets.Bitcoin.com. At the time of writing, DOT is trading at $17.22, up 8% over the past 24 hours.

Ukraine’s government-owned nuclear power plant picked a firm to build a massive data center in Rivne for cryptocurrency mining operations. After a bidding process, Energoatom chose Kyiv Energy Construction Company to handle the nuclear plant crypto mining project.

Nuclear Power Plant Operator Expects to Launch the Data Center in 2022

According to official documents, the data center will be based in the Rivne nuclear power plant, after the construction firm got 8.92 million Hryvnia ($317,620) in funding. The only competitor in the bidding was Ukrenergobudproek. However, they allegedly made an expensive offer, said the regional news outlet Forklog.

The Kyiv Energy Construction Company expects to finish the data center building by August 31, 2022. Per the announcement, the contractor is required to send the documentation that details the whole process. It includes “host state registers, electronic archives, and computing facilities.”

In terms of technical details, the nuclear power plant has a capacity of 2,657 megawatts, and it was built in the late 1970s. Also, the operations of the state-owned nuclear facilities started at the beginning of 1980.

In October 2020, Energoatom also signed a memorandum with a subsidiary of crypto mining giant Bitfury. With the new data center, local media outlets believe Bitfury miners could move their operations into the power plant’s facilities.

Ukraine’s Interest Towards Building Crypto Mining Data Centers in Nuclear Plants

The deal between Energoatom and Kyiv Energy Construction Company is not a surprising move. In fact, the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine asked Energoatom in May 2020 to conduct research to assess crypto mining’s feasibility at their nuclear plants.

As an anecdotal fact in terms of crypto mining in Ukrainian nuclear plants, the nation’s Security Service found illegal crypto mining equipment in a nuclear power plant in 2019.

The installation’s illegal mining rigs were found in the Southern region of Ukraine. Moreover, the investigations determined that such illegal equipment breached a “state secret.”

Global music distribution service Ditto has unveiled the latest addition to its service lineup for musicians with a blockchain-based financing platform named Opulous.

Opulous Peer-to-Peer Lending Platform Serves as a Loan Pool Designed to Help Artists

Ditto continues its efforts to improve the value chain for artists. Unlike other decentralized finance (defi) protocols, Opulous reflects asset-based lending, which bridges the physical and digital worlds. The Opulous’ defi lending mechanism, which is being developed on the Algorand public blockchain, leverages music copyrights’ tangibility through a smart contract setup that automatically handles principal and interest payments along with distributions to investors.

For musicians already receiving royalties, this presents a unique opportunity to monetize their assets or contribute to the pool to stake other artists. When seeking capital, artists can access funds by collateralizing loans from Opulous’ Music Copyright Pools with their music royalties.

Besides digitizing music as an asset class, the move will invite more democratized participation from artists and investors seeking to gain a foothold in the music industry, which is undergoing tremendous annual growth and expected to double in size by 2030. Artists benefit from interest rates starting as low as 4%, while investors in the copyright pools can add exposure to music royalties as an asset class for 10% returns per annum.

Per Ditto CEO Lee Parsons,

Opulous cuts out traditional banking, providing musicians with a platform with minimal interest payments, while giving investors the chance to stake a claim in one of the most exciting and fastest-growing financial industries in the world.

Ditto, which has already processed more than $1 billion in royalties for its 250,000-plus users, sees industry revenues doubling in the next ten years, building a compelling investment thesis. In keeping with Opulous’ mission to democratize musicians’ financial access, users outside the Ditto ecosystem are welcome to join the peer-to-peer lending framework.

Opulous has raised $1.5 million in funding to-date from BASIC, Borderless Capital, Kosmos Capital, Somesing, and TrustVerse. Roll out of the platform’s minimum viable product (MVP) is anticipated in two months as development proceeds.

Elastos, which built its decentralized application (dapp) platform and currency (ELA) to protect users’ digital assets and creations, will be among the first token staking partners for Opulous’ proof-of-stake consensus protocol. Opulous, in concert with Elastos, will allow investors to stake their Elastos (ELA) coins within the Music Copyright Pools.

According to Clarence Liu, the VP of Development at the Elastos Foundation,

Elastos and Ditto Music have been researching how blockchain can address fundamental inefficiencies in the music industry. Access to funding – which Opulous will address – is only the tip of the iceberg.

“Our collaboration has much more in the pipeline and our community is definitely set on using the forward momentum sparked by recent world events to introduce new users to the decentralized internet ideals set by Elastos,” Liu concludes.

During the last year, Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem has grown exponentially to form a multi Billion Dollar market. As Decentralized Finance expands, it becomes more and more relevant to have cross-chain connections that enable crypto assets to flow instantly and seamlessly across blockchain networks. These make it possible for DeFi platforms to be an effective alternative to centralized exchanges. Today, pNetwork launches the first EOS to Ethereum cross-chain connection to enable the EOS crypto asset to be moved into Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem.

EOS on Ethereum

EOS, the native token on the EOS blockchain, is a top20 cryptocurrency by market cap and the engine powering one of the most active dApps ecosystems. The asset counts over $ 3.5 Billion in daily trading volumes, figuring as the 9th most traded cryptocurrency. At present, only a fraction of the total is happening in a decentralized fashion.

While the DeFi ecosystem on EOS continues to grow, it has not yet reached Ethereum’s size. The latter powers Billions in daily trading volumes, Uniswap being the largestlarges liquidity protocol in existence and the fourth biggest DeFi protocol in terms of Total Value Locked.

Following the delivery of 26 bridges connecting six different blockchain protocols, including the cross-chain transfer of popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin, pNetwork launches today a new cross-chain connection that brings EOS to Ethereum.

As the first tokenised version of EOS, pEOS makes the asset compatible with Ethereum’s DeFi. This creates a benefit on both sides, enabling Ethereum’s DeFi protocols to expand their range of assets supported and granting EOS the option to be traded in a decentralized fashion as well as being supported as a collateral type by major Ethereum-based landing platforms.

Cross-chain connections are critical for a variety of use-cases, from NFTs to market making to decentralized indexes such as PieDAO’s Pies. pNetwork-powered asset tokenisation on Ethereum enables such indexes to represent the entire crypto market.

All pTokenised assets are pegged 1:1 to their underlying asset and are available for automated minting or redeeming on the pTokens dApp. In addition, pTokens are supported on a variety of DeFi protocols, decentralized exchanges and wallets on a growing number of blockchains.

Making Ethereum and EOS dApps Interoperable

Ethereum and EOS are two of the most active ecosystems for dApps, counting thousands of users each. By connecting these two blockchain environments, pNetwork aims to support the growth and development of decentralized applications such as lending/borrowing, trading, derivatives, and more. Acting as a cross-chain highway for cryptocurrencies to frictionlessly move from one blockchain to another, pNetwork powers the first bi-directional connection between the Ethereum and EOS blockchains.

Users on either blockchain are now able to interact with both ecosystems without ever leaving their blockchain of choice. Projects from both Ethereum and EOS communities have developed building blocks to create the next-generation financial system – with the connection between these two, users will find an even more powerful DeFi ecosystem.

By leveraging pNetwork’s cross-chain solution, dApps on the two blockchain platforms now have the opportunity to interoperate. Each ecosystem leveraging its counterpart’s strengths ultimately creates a benefit on both sides and sets the basis for sustainable growth. The presence of an EOS/ETH decentralized trading pair both with Ethereum’s and EOS’s decentralized finance, for example, makes it possible for market makers to arbitrage between the two blockchains. This results in a more liquid decentralized market for both assets.

Michael Rubinov, president of Kronos Advanced Technologies, commented on the company’s stance towards cryptocurrencies:

In the last ten years, much has been said about how cryptocurrency will revolutionize payments, services, businesses and will change the world the way we know it. Cryptocurrency has changed e-commerce: as more and more people now shop online. Cryptocurrency gives customers more reasons to utilize the convenience of online shopping, as it mitigates the risk of fraud for both vendors and shoppers.

By adopting dogecoin as a form of payment, Kronos also expect to market N95 masks to the entire meme coin community on Reddit, which has grown over 670,000 members. The company also praised the fact that Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk endorses dogecoin as one of his favorite cryptocurrencies.

Spacex and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been trying to get to the bottom of what happened with the popular trading app Robinhood when it stopped people from buying shares of hot stocks, like Gamestop. The shares of these stocks became popular due to the Wallstreetbets movement.

Elon Musk Says People Want the Truth From Robinhood

During an interview on The Good Time Show via the Clubhouse app Sunday night, Elon Musk grilled the CEO of trading app Robinhood, Vlad Tenev, over the company’s decision to restrict hot stocks last week, including Gamestop. On Friday, Robinhood also restricted crypto trading, citing “extraordinary market conditions.”

“What happened last week? Why can’t people buy the Gamestop shares? The people demand an answer and they want to know the details and the truth,” Musk said.

Tenev began by explaining the structure of his company. “Robinhood is actually a couple of companies,” he described. Robinhood Financial processes trades, Robinhood Securities clears and settles the trades, and Robinhood Crypto which deals with crypto trades.

The Robinhood CEO detailed that last Wednesday, his platform experienced “unprecedented volume” as “a lot of these so-called meme stocks were going viral on social media and people were joining Robinhood” to buy these stocks. Consequently, the company “received a file” from the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) Thursday morning at about 3:30 AM PST. It requested Robinhood to “put up money to the NSCC based on some factors,” including the volatility of certain securities. Tenev clarified that “this is the equities business so it’s based on stock trading and not options trading or anything else,” elaborating:

They gave us a file with a deposit and the request was around $3 billion dollars which is about an order of magnitude more than what it typically is.

Musk interrupted Tenev, questioning: “Why is that so high? It sounds like this is an unprecedented increase in demand for capital. What formula did they use to calculate that?”

Tenev replied: “We don’t have the full details. It’s a little bit of an opaque formula but there’s a component called the VAR of it, which is the Value at Risk, and that’s based on kind of some fairly quantitative things … and then there’s a special component which is discretionary so that kind of acts as a multiplier.” Tenev also noted that up until that point, his company “has raised a little bit around two billion dollars in total venture capital,” so the request was “a big number.”

The Tesla CEO interrupted again, asking: “What everyone wants to know is did something maybe shady go down here? It seems weird that you’d get a sudden $10 billion demand in the morning … suddenly out of nowhere.” Tenev swiftly corrected Musk that the number was $3 billion. The Robinhood CEO then emphasized:

I wouldn’t impugn shadiness to it or anything like that, and actually the NSCC was reasonable subsequent to this. They worked with us to actually lower it. It was unprecedented activity.

Musk abruptly asked Tenev: “Is there anyone holding you hostage right now?” Tenev chuckled and replied: “No, no, I’m okay. Thanks for asking.” Both laughed.

The Robinhood CEO proceeded to explain what happened, calling the experience “nerve-wrecking.” He said after receiving the request for $3 billion, his chief operating officer called up someone higher up at the NSCC to discuss what to do. “There was another call and they lowered it to something like $1.4 billion from $3 billion,” Tenev reiterated that it was still a high number. His company then proposed a plan to the NSCC of “marking these volatile stocks that were kind of driving the activity position-closing only.”

Then, at about 5 to 5:30 AM PST, before the market opened, the NSCC came back and reduced the deposit requirement to $700 million, “which we then deposited and paid promptly,” Tenev emphasized. Acknowledging that the move was bad for customers, the Robinhood CEO said, “We had no choice, in this case. We had to conform to our regulatory capital requirements and so the team did what they could to make sure we were available for customers.”

The Spacex CEO further questioned: “Who controls this organization, this clearinghouse?” Tenev replied: “It’s a consortium. It’s not quite a government agency. I don’t really know the details of all of that.” Nonetheless, he emphasized that “To be fair … I think there was legitimate sort of turmoil in the markets … so there probably is some amount of extra risk in the system that warrants higher requirements so it’s not entirely unreasonable.” He noted that lots of other brokers were in the same situation and had to restrict the same activity.

“So it sounds like this organization calls you up and they basically have a gun to your head: either hand over this money or else,” the Spacex CEO summarized, elaborating:

Basically, what people are wondering is did you sell your clients down the river or did you have no choice. If you had no choice, that’s understandable but then we got to find out why you had no choice and who are these people that are saying you have no choice.

“I think that’s fair. We have to comply with these requirements. Financial institutions have requirements,” Tenev responded. Nonetheless, he suggested that it would be helpful to know the formula the NSCC uses to calculate these requirements so companies can plan better.

Musk proceeded to ask about whether there was outside pressure forcing Robinhood to take the action it did. Tenev affirmed that there is “a rumor that Citadel or other market makers kind of pressured us into doing this.” However, he clarified, “that’s just false,” emphasizing that “this was a clearinghouse decision and it was just based on the capital requirements so from our perspective Citadel and other market makers weren’t involved in that.”

During the same Clubhouse interview, Elon also revealed that he is a supporter of bitcoin and should have bought the cryptocurrency eight years ago. He believes that bitcoin is on the verge of getting broad acceptance by traditional finance people. On Monday, Robinhood raised another $2.4 billion from shareholders after it secured $1 billion last Thursday.

PRESS RELEASE. The AdGram service was founded a year ago and is currently the largest advertising exchange in Telegram.

AdGram helps brands place large advertising volumes in channels and groups quickly and efficiently. Channels and groups benefit from expansion of their audience, it is easy to find advertisers and increase the earnings from advertising placements via AdGram.

Over the last 12 months, the service has gained a huge experience in communications with both advertisers and administrators from different countries, which has highlighted issues with settlements in multiple currencies. After overcoming these obstacles, it was decided that cryptocurrency could be the key to solving this problem.

With the termination of the Telegram team’s work on the TON project in May 2020 (the messenger lost one of its monetization methods), Free TON was launched which took over the development and popularization of TON Crystal using the open source code from the original TON. The uniqueness of FreeTON is that it is one of the few projects where all the tokens belong to the community and it is developing as a decentralized autonomous organization.

The potential of the underlying technology and the growth of the community inspired AdGram and in October 2020 they partnered with the FreeTON Community and fully integrated Crystal as a means of payment. Synergy with FreeTON made it possible to take a big step towards using cryptocurrencies as a single, simple and clear means of payment.

The ability to pay with tokens for advertising in Telegram creates a powerful use case for the TON Crystal token. Huge and constantly growing volume of the advertising market is vital for tokenomics as it creates supply and demand for market participants, thereby increasing the liquidity of the token itself.

For administrators and advertisers transactions in TON Crystal is simple, convenient and fast! It also solves the problem of collecting details for transfers in various currencies, and avoids paying banking fees.

Advertising on Telegram and the FreeTON blockchain, which is the successor of Durov’s original (but never happened Durov’s TON), create a strong and impact-resistant synergy of mutual benefits. This shows markets and communities can develop in a self-regulated environment.

PRESS RELEASE. CEX.IO LOAN experiences massive institutional demand for its crypto-backed lending service, with 41% of customers requesting to borrow cash against Bitcoin, 53% against Ethereum, and 6% against DeFi tokens.

Crypto-backed lending service CEX.IO LOAN that launched in October 2020 in select global jurisdictions, has been experiencing major demand, receiving over $100 million worth of loan requests to date. While the service has been widely popular among retail investors, most of the platform’s loan requests came from institutional investors.

According to CEX.IO LOAN, such an increase in demand can be attributed to the institutionalization of the cryptocurrency industry. Institutional investors, who have cryptocurrencies in their possession, regard it as a potential collateral for borrowing funds and actively utilise it as such. The borrowed funds are then used for further investment purposes.

In addition to featuring cutting-edge security and advanced anti-fraud measures, CEX.IO Group operates a regulated service, which has been licensed as a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) provider by the Gibraltar Financial Service Commission (GFSC) since last year. In addition to this, the Government of Gibraltar recently granted CEX.IO Limited a Money Lender License, allowing the firm to extend its ecosystem of regulated services with CEX.IO LOAN.

Institutional clients also prefer the company’s digital asset-backed lending service due to the convenience offered to users. On the CEX.IO LOAN platform, customers can borrow cash against their cryptocurrency assets in a quick and simple manner, without having to deal with credit checks or any unnecessary paperwork. To access the company’s instant crypto-backed lending service, new users have to open an account at the digital asset exchange and pass the mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML checks.

CEX.IO LOAN serves various cryptocurrency market participants, from retail investors, traders, and HODLers to startups, entrepreneurs, and large enterprises. As part of a flexible crypto-backed lending service, users can borrow any amount between $500 and $100,000 at competitive interest rates starting at 8.75% per year. Loan duration ranging from seven days to one year.

Currently, retail users can borrow funds against their Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) assets. Based on the company’s data, the feature has already experienced high demand from VIP clients, with 41% of all CEX.IO LOAN customers borrowing cash against Bitcoin (BTC), 53% against Ethereum (ETH), and 6% against DeFi tokens.

The company has recently introduced a VIP-exclusive feature to offer flexible lending conditions and the ability to use decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens as collateral for institutional clients on the crypto-backed lending platform.

Furthermore, to best serve institutional customers, the requests and queries of VIP clients are handled individually by dedicated personal managers on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Interestingly, 14% of CEX.IO VIP customers have already asked their personal managers about borrowing funds via the crypto-backed lending service.

“As institutional investors find the digital asset industry increasingly attractive, it’s a pleasure to serve them with our enterprise-grade instant crypto-backed loan platform. Security, convenience, and compliance are key priorities for corporate clients, which are features that we have been providing to all our clients in the rapidly growing CEX.IO ecosystem. Most importantly, we want to provide institutional clients with the best service. For that reason, VIP clients enjoy exclusive benefits, such as dedicated personal managers and flexible lending options, on the CEX.IO LOAN platform,” Anton Chashchin, Commercial Director for the CEX.IO LOAN service, stated.

In the announcement, the firm revealed further details about the size of the funds clients borrow on the CEX.IO LOAN platform. Based on the company’s data, while retail investors borrow $1,400 on average, VIP clients request larger-sized loans that vary in size, with the typical amount being $1 million or higher.

Institutional clients do not just borrow more but also need the funds for more extended periods which usually range between 6 and 12 months. According to the company, this phenomenon indicates a long-term strategy for VIP clients to manage their assets.

PRESS RELEASE. PARSIQ, a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform connecting on-chain and off-chain applications in real-time, announced that its PRQ token is now listed on OKEx with USDT base pair.

Please take note of the following go-live schedule:

PRQ Deposit : 07:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Spot Trading : PRQ / USDT : 10:00am January 28, 2021 (UTC) PRQ Withdrawal : 10:00 January 29, 2021 (UTC)

PARSIQ is a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform that serves as a multi-level bridge between blockchains and off-chain applications. PARSIQ’s features automate the blockchain analytics and monitoring process, providing customizable workflows with real-time intelligence.

Developers and individual users can transform the blockchain data to their favorite off-chain application or web service.

Among the obvious use cases is monitoring the wallets of traders and ordinary users. Among the non-obvious are complex system integrations for financial institutions and DeFi projects that use the PARSIQ infrastructure to improve security, conduct audits, comply with regulatory requirements, AML, and expand their workflows in other ways.

The infrastructure underneath PARSIQ’s user interface is built with their proprietary programming language ParsiQL, and its users’ benefits are multiplying with each supported integration.

PRQ Token

PARSIQ Token (PRQ) is an essential piece of the PARSIQ platform that co-exists with FIAT payments for using its services. Payments within the platform that are made in PRQ tokens guarantee a discounted rate. During the first Epoch when PRQ tokens are used as payment for running Smart-Triggers users receive higher execution limits, unlock transport methods, and are able to propose features that can be added to the platform.

In October 2020, the PARSIQ team released plans for Epoch 2.0.

#1. Public Projects

With Public Projects users can subscribe to existing PARSIQ Projects that were pre-made by other users. By paying in PRQ, users that have subscribed to the Public Project will incentivize the creators to create interesting, complex, and more important – problem-solving projects.

#2. User Data and PRQ

Every single monitoring target (primitive of type address, a struct with the field of address type, table row) would require 1 PRQ to hold after the implementation. It means that if there are 1000 addresses (960 in the table as rows, 30 as primitives, 10 in the structs) then the User would need 1000 PRQ on the connected Ethereum Account balance.

#3. IQ Protocol

IQ Protocol will allow risk-free PRQ lending and collateral-less borrowing. Risk-free PRQ lending means that PRQ is not transferred from the lender’s address to the borrower’s address. Details on the algorithm are available in the dedicated explainer on PARSIQ’s blog.

#4. PRQBoost

PRQ Boost is a liquidity boost program to incentivize PRQ/ETH liquidity providers on Uniswap, which goes with the PRQBOOST utility tokens to increase rewards for liquidity providers.

PARSIQ is actively working to partner with major layer 1 blockchain protocols to expand the range of blockchain integrations and give projects that build on those protocols the ability to monitor and automate workflows between blockchain and off-chain.

PRESS RELEASE. YFX, the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts has just launched, adding an important piece to the DeFi money legos, and creating a direct competition against CEX on derivatives trading.

The most traded Bitcoin product in centralized exchanges is Bitcoin futures, which is 10 times bigger than spot trading in terms of the trading volume. But in DEX, spot trading platforms like Uniswap are occupying a large portion of the total trading volume, and there is not a single decentralized futures trading platform that could reach even 1/10 of Uniswap’s trading volume. What stops decentralized futures trading platforms from becoming 10 times bigger than Uniswap? Why are decentralized futures trading platforms performing worse than their centralized counterparts?

The main reason is that decentralized futures exchanges don’t currently provide an attractive futures product to compete with centralized futures exchanges. For instance, centralized futures exchanges like BitMex can provide 100x leverage on Bitcoin futures trading. On the other hand, decentralized futures exchanges like dYdX only offer 10x leverage. None of the decentralized exchanges can keep up with the 100x leverage offering from centralized exchanges.

YFX Descartes V1 uses QIC-AMM and a system de-risk mechanism to migrate perpetual futures trading from CEX to DEX without reducing the trading leverage, which makes YFX the first DEX that could offer 100x leverage on a perpetual contract. You can do everything on YFX that you can do on BitMex or OKEx. YFX is poised to compete directly against established centralized exchanges. YFX Descartes V1 runs on the TRON MainNet, for faster transaction times and cheaper gas fees compared to Ethereum. The YFX team is also working on Ethereum’s Layer 2 solution to provide pragmatic perpetual trading on DEX. YFX team plans to launch their DEX on Huobi Heco and Ethereum Test net in Q1, 2021.

About YFX

YFX is the first DEX that offers 100x trading leverage on perpetual contracts. YFX Descartes V1 launched on the TRON MainNet, and all trades are held and processed by smart contracts. The main goal of the YFX team, which is formed by a group of engineers who have years of experience working on trading systems and blockchain, is to build a DEX that can compete with CEX on derivative trading.

The Wall Street Bets saga, an incredibly ridiculous story about a group of amateur Reddit investors who beat career Wall Street hedge funds at their own game, is to be made into a movie.

According to a report by online news site Deadline on Jan. 31, Metro Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) won the rights to produce the film in a bidding war involving major Hollywood movie houses.

The movie is to be based on a book proposed by author Ben Mezrich. Mezrich’s previous work, “The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding Of Facebook, a Tale Of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal,” was adapted into the motion picture “The Social Network.”

The title to his planned latest book offering is called “The Antisocial Network,” said the report, quoting sources familiar with the development. The book is expected to go out to publishers later this February, it said.

However, it is not yet clear what shape or structure the movie will take. MGM’s Michael DeLuca will produce the film. DeLuca also produced the Academy-Award winning The Social Network. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss will executive produce via their Winklevoss Pictures production company.

The Wall Street Bets group noticed that major hedge funds on Wall Street had been placing short bets against companies they considered to be dying. The funds particularly targeted Gamestop, the world’s largest video game retailer, continually shorting the company’s shares.

But the Redditors saw an opportunity to make profit and collectively bet the other way, buying shares and stock options. This resulted in the value of the Gamestop shares soaring by more than 2,600% in January.

Hedge funds that had shorted the stock incurred losses running into several billions of dollars. One fund, Melvin Capital, reportedly lost up to $7 billion to the “short squeeze” in January, forcing it to restructure its investment portfolio to ensure a faster escape in future “squeezes.”

The Reddit traders also extended the pump to a few other stocks considered to be dying, including AMC (which climbed over 900% in January), as well as Nokia and Blackberry. This surge of activity resulted in a major controversy when the trading app Robinhood began restricting trade on certain stocks.

Sharing exclusive data with Bitcoin.com, Simplex cofounder and chief analytics officer Netanel Kabala says:

While the international press coverage of Bitcoin’s rally has caused a swathe of new users to flock to the industry and buy-in, outflows have been equally significant. Of the total amount of cryptocurrency sold in the last six months, 43% was off ramped in December alone.

A quick look at Google Trends for the term ‘Bitcoin’ echoes these developments, especially now that new equity instruments like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and big-name funds like Blackrock are adding exposure and raising crypto awareness.

Still, given the increased ability to quickly convert crypto and withdraw in fiat currencies, the uptick in funds leaving the ecosystem is astonishing. Part of this can be attributed to the growing fungibility of cryptocurrency, primarily helped by the support of players like Simplex, which empowers users to buy, sell, and spend crypto through Visa partnerships.

Although some of the latest rally’s onlookers have decried the rapid rise in crypto valuations as proof that a bubble is forming in this nascent asset class, others within the industry see the development as a harbinger of times to come. One of the areas this is most apparent is altcoins.

Data compiled by Simplex illustrates that as Bitcoin prices have leveled off above $30,000, daily purchases of altcoins have risen by approximately 65%. More interestingly, the data highlights that newer users account for nearly 20% of this volume, marking a sharp increase in the number of novice retail investors expanding and diversifying their exposure within the ecosystem.

Poloniex, one of the top 20 global cryptocurrency exchanges, which has adopted Simplex’s platform, has experienced these results firsthand. Karen McHenry, Poloniex’s Director of Product, attributes this development to greater access within the ecosystem, especially with Simplex’s buy option, which promotes instant account funding alongside the heightened ability to cash out quickly.

She also doesn’t see the ability to more quickly convert from crypto to fiat as harming interest despite the eyepopping amounts taken off exchanges.

It may sound surprising, but adding the ‘sell’ option actually has a positive impact on the number of crypto transactions too.

Though this easy offramp and soaring volume of sell orders might seem negative for prices, it can also be viewed as a healthy reflection of the ecosystem’s growing use cases. Besides making it easier to exit and enter, growing areas like decentralized finance (defi) and greater fungibility all contribute to a cryptocurrency’s value proposition.

As institutions begin lining up to add exposure as retail accumulation climbs, Bitcoin momentum may actually accelerate, and by extension, lift the altcoins sought after by the newcomers seeking opportunities outside the seminal crypto coin.

McHenry adds:

If the bull market can maintain its momentum, some of these BTC profits will flow into altcoins, which are particularly popular among retail investors. This creates a positive feedback loop, with traders who turn a profit prone to telling their friends about crypto, which brings more investment into the space.

This past week, another social media trend started on the Reddit forum r/wallstreetbets, which aims to initiate a large silver short squeeze in order to push the price of the precious metal to $1,000 per ounce. However, the silver squeeze trend comes with controversy, as numerous wallstreetbets supporters believe hedge funds like Melvin Capital and Citadel are behind the silver push.

The Controversial ‘Silver Squeeze’

During the last week, news.Bitcoin.com reported on the wallstreetbets (WSB) saga taking place on social media forums and the infamous subreddit r/wallstreetbets. Since the mega short squeeze on the Gamestop (GME) shares, the squeeze maneuver has also spilled into a number of other stocks. This week, shares from the Russell 3000 Index (RUA) were targeted including tickers like NOK, GOGO, AMCX, and FIZZ. But the trend didn’t stop there, as one post, in particular, had called for a “silver squeeze.” The WSB Reddit post called for the silver squeeze to push the price of silver from $25 per ounce to $1,000.

Now since the post was published, the Reddit admins in charge of moderating r/wallstreetbets removed the post. But that was long after the message was made viral by the participants discussing the pros and cons of attempting to squeeze silver. Now the reason people think the silver short squeeze post may be shady, is because a number of WSB Redditors believe the silver squeeze was invoked by the hedge funds losing money in order to cover their GME losses. There are a great number of Reddit posts warning that people should not participate in the silver short squeeze.

One post said:

Citadel is the 5th largest owner of [silver], it’s imperative we do not ‘squeeze’ it. These are hedge fund bots spamming awards.

The people who dislike the silver trend on WSB, have also warned that Melvin Capital Management is also a big silver holder. Unfortunately, it is hard to tell where the silver pump threads and posts are stemming from, as there are many free-market supporters who are fans of the precious metal sometimes referred to as the ‘poor man’s gold.’

Despite this, there are numbers of WSB fans and Redditors claiming the silver pump stemmed from hedge fund people and they believe there are imposters everywhere now. Some of these people are growing irrational, getting mad at anyone who posts about silver. Many WSB supporters might be feeling the pain from Gamestop Corp. shares dropping significantly on Monday.

In Spite of Controversy, Something Is Sparking Silver Demand

Despite the speculation, some sort of demand was invoked when it comes to silver prices and obtaining physical bullion. For instance, if you are attempting to purchase an ounce or ounces of silver bullion online, the process is far more complicated now than it was last week. A large portion of bars and coins are either sold out or the prices are marked up considerably.

This is simple arbitrage. #Silver futures are 28.67. Silver Eagles on Apmex are $41.66, thats a 45% premium to futures. Obvious opportunity to buy futures & stand for delivery for a 35% discount on physical right? But when they don't have it, Futures = $41.66/oz. #silversqueeze — Jonathan #SILVERSQUEEZE Mergott (@Jmergz1985) February 1, 2021

All the American Eagles are sold out across a number of bullion dealers. On Sunday morning, a few big-name dealers have halted a great number of silver sales. News.Bitcoin.com’s most recent WSB report disclosed how SD Bullion sold nearly 10x the number of silver ounces than usual. People visiting bullion dealer websites like Provident, Apmex, and JD Bullion could see the unprecedented demand targeting physical silver.

“In the last week, we have seen a dramatic shift in Silver demand from our customers,” said Ken Lewis CEO of the bullion dealer Apmex. “For example, the ratio of ounces sold per day was running about two times earlier in the week and closer to four times the average demand by the end of the week,” Lewis added.

The Apmex CEO further stressed:

Once markets closed on Friday, we saw demand hit as much as six times a typical business day and more than 12 times a normal weekend day. Combined with the extremely high demand levels, we are also seeing a surge in new customers. On Saturday alone, we added as many new customers as we usually add in a week.

Additionally, the hashtag “#silversqueeze” has been trending throughout the United States and a few other countries on Twitter during the last 48 hours. By the late afternoon on Sunday, spot silver and futures traded at $27 per Troy ounce, and by Monday morning spot silver traded 7.7% higher at $29.76. The commodity hopped above the $30 region, and silver prices per ounce exchanged hands at $30.35 an ounce. One ounce of .999 silver is hovering in the $29 price handle at the time of publication
